  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through iterative observation and pattern accumulation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mara leaves dust on her palms. Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit reconfigures her relationship to purity and control with felt cost: she relinquishes her professional impulse to strip chaos. One meaningful deepening occurs through the twenty-eight days of observation, narrowing her stance from salvage to acceptance. Causality remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates through layered images (glass/light, frost/water, fire/ash) that converge at the ending to reweight Elena's survival from providential to ordinary. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, stars, three weeks post-fire). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena's realization that she was "simply geography" loosens her chest, and the decision to return with the ledger reweights her artistic practice ("pieces about survival and emptiness"). Cost is conceptual—the loss of a comforting narrative—but legible in "something loosened" and the shift from seeking silence to choosing action. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through winterglass imagery, the tuning fork ritual, Claire's thermal mapping, and culminates in Marina mapping her own contentment—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance with felt cost (the irreversible trade of hearing for this new art). Orientation is clean within the first 120 words. The escalation is a single deepening (external validation → self-application) rather than a tightening of options, which fits the lens but keeps pressure modest. Cost is legible in the final image: she has accepted transformation over rectification.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Meridian becomes "eternal keeper," occupying the threshold permanently with the cost of her living world ties forfeited. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—the distress signals layer and organize, the impossible spaces unfold progressively, and the ending reweights the opening kelp-wrapped package and her decades of failure. Orientation anchors (underwater library, Meridian, post-package-arrival) are clear by the second paragraph. One minor causality softness: the library's spatial-manipulation power is stated but not previously shown constraining any choice before Meridian decides to use it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mira's anonymous runs build a pattern that culminates in the bell-ringing assembly. Orientation anchors quickly (ridge settlement, sanctions, three months). However, the closure moment—community members sorting food and "no one mentioned leaving"—lands as a soft reset rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The bell's thirteen rings function as a召集 device, but the transition from fracture to unity occurs off-page in the "amplified quiet"; we do not see a forfeited option or a character paying a price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (image-led, breathing pattern accumulates meaning). Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The closure unit—unused love revealed in breath and light—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks felt cost; Marina's question is answered too cleanly without sacrifice or tactical constraint. The "past life memory" frame introduces a causal thread that dissolves into atmosphere without shaping present stakes. One meaningful deepening occurs (the woman's knot loosening), but the protagonist does not alter or foreclose a path—she confirms what she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Miriam, maze designer) and where (living bridge garden) early; the temporal fluidity is purposeful. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered visions and geometric principles until the final dissolution reweights the opening stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (dispersal into garden memory) with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening as she reaches the maze center and the fragment flares; causality holds under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain from chains → puzzle → vault → soldier encounter holds clearly. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (chains fall, collaboration begins) with felt cost (three years of solitary burden ending). The Orientation Test passes: who/where/when anchor by the opening lines. One weakness: the soldier's bolt-cutters appear conveniently without prior setup, and his immediate agreement softens the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's forge work layers absences (her father's voice, her diagnosis, her future children) into a single silver component that will filter the client's trauma-sound. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, forge, client's need), and the ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing—"breaking wasn't ending—just the terrible, necessary sound of transformation"—that reweights the premise with undeniable thematic cost. The closure effect is legible and the lens holds, though the final image relies more on assertion ("trust learned how to begin reknitting itself") than a concrete on-page action that makes the cost visible in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: golden hour merges with moonlight, flower code reinterprets, portraits multiply into a veil. Orientation anchors (Emerald Station, golden hour, Mira waiting) land within the first paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira shifts from thief to witness, scattering the portraits as "luminous seeds" and arranging flowers for the next person. Cost is conceptual (renouncing possession for illumination) and legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moonbeam curtain reveals that every moment holds its own golden hour. The elderly woman's arrival feels convenient rather than causally earned, weakening the RR slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative lens is stable—ice melting, glass cooling, reflection building—but closure delivers only atmospheric resonance without a decisive change or felt cost. The final image of Mira "kept drawing" restates her established pattern rather than reweighting it; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established (rusted library, Maya, seashell coordinates) within the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Maya's self-realization and officers arriving, but cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift in the final image, only a claim that she "knew exactly who she was becoming." The causal chain from cast cipher to library trap is present but the reveal-and-officers-arrive beat resolves via convenience (Sophie contacted prosecutors off-page) rather than Maya's on-page agency at the ending. Under a causal lens, the final beat should narrow options or exact a price; here it opens them via external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren commits to mapping the endless night with the star's final vanishing as the pivot that forecloses return. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—the ambered hush deepens through sensory layering until the final beat reweights her stance from student to cartographer. Orientation anchors early (ridge fort, eastern wall, star-watching). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes she's standing inside the map itself, which crystallizes her choice with conceptual cost (navigating starless dark forever).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its looped-timeline pattern early and accumulates density through recurring images (courtyard, fountain, ice) that shift meaning across iterations. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—J-7's recognition that "repetition was just another word for consciousness learning its own shape"—with the conceptual cost of accepting endless循环 as the nature of thought itself. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who, where, when, why). The meaningful deepening occurs when the violin amalgamates all 341 iterations into singular awareness, reweighting the dominant stake (understanding thought-origin) through accumulated perspective rather than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Situational pressure. Closure lands via Viktor's gathered confession and the trio's decision to pursue transparency, creating a before/after with felt social cost (resignation, institutional exposure). Orientation anchors quickly (Mira, forecourt, night shift). The eavesdropping discovery creates a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse—Viktor will resign and face consequences, stated rather than viscerally dramatized in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's deliberate withering proves the garden's recognition, reweighting measurements against memory with visible professional and reputational cost. The causal chain (bury marbles → withhold care → resume → demonstration) is clear and motivated. Orientation anchors quickly (withered vine dresser, maze, sensors). One micro turn when the hedges respond overnight transforms the setup into proof. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (marbles as pattern), held cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Renna's tinkering leads to discovery, which leads to showing Voss, yielding validation. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The closure—Voss's validation and the promise of "new revelations"—lands as a Decisive Change in Renna's professional status, but the cost is minimal: she feared showing anyone, then immediately receives affirmation without complication. The turn is present but the price feels thin.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through discovery beats, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the journal discovery reweights Celeste's creative stance. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (flooded orchestra pit, violin case, three days post-flood). The cost, however, remains conceptual—"would disrupt everything"—without an on-page action or forfeiture that forecloses a path; the ending crystallizes intent but the price is deferred. One meaningful tightening occurs (program → map → discovery), sufficient for this length, though the mechanics feel guided rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases from fever recovery → illustration encounter → confession memory → recalibration choice, with the final image (smudge as proof of alteration) reweighting certainty as the true danger. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts perpetual uncertainty and the burden of Eva's death as "ballast," foreclosing the oracle-certainty path with felt cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (mountain station, Mira, post-fever, dawn). One meaningful deepening occurs when delirium surfaces the swallowed confession, narrowing her options to either continue filtering or honor margins.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal: radio confession → revelation → decision to contact authorities. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (Mara will expose the crime, ending the men's secret), and orientation anchors quickly (Mara, tunnel, 2 AM, ghost-shift story chase). The confession arrives via radio rather than through Mara's agency, making the peak turn coincidence-adjacent; her role shifts from investigator to witness, which slightly undercuts protagonist-driven escalation but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (decay/growth, folding/unfolding, witnessing) toward a final image of integration. Orientation anchors arrive slowly—who/where/when are legible by ~150 words (acceptable for lyric accumulation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she incorporates the artifact into the swan, sealing her method with new geometry), but the cost is conceptual and oblique; no on-page sentence makes the price undeniable. The vision sequence introduces new information (future flowers, perpetual visitors) without prior causality to earn it, weakening the "because/therefore" chain even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a causal structure: eclipse invitation → shared moment → lullaby triggers memory → reconciliation. Closure lands on the page (Diane crying, curl as talisman, talking again) with felt relational cost. However, the eclipse functions more as atmospheric backdrop than causal pressure—removing it would not fundamentally alter the mechanics of reconnection. The "magic" arrives on schedule without genuine resistance, and no persistent constraint shapes Maya's tactics or the final image beyond the pre-planned setup.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a layered, reflective structure early and maintains coherent tonal deepening through the historian's handling of objects and reconstruction of fragments. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of gathering fragments "long after the last dream had faded into permanent, bronze silence" reweights the archival purpose with undeniable elegiac cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraphs. One weakness: the escalation is density-driven rather than choice-driven, which fits the lens but limits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (approaching Charged Poise): Margaret's walk into the night with the recognition that "accident and prophecy were closer cousins" reweights her thirty-seven years of work, and the cost is conceptual—her authorial control was illusory all along. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the man's microdot revelation and Margaret's layered reflections deepen the stake (her search for transformation) through density increase and cadence shift. The piece holds a single POV and one continuous pub-to-night scene with clear anchors (Barnacle pub, Crake Island, lighthouse). One meaningful tightening occurs when the man's explanation narrows Margaret's understanding of her own work. The conceptual cost is legible: her meditative practice unknowingly directed intelligence operations, stripping her of sole ownership of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (basement chapel, dimensional anchor, dawn summons) land quickly. The piece establishes a Causal lens: Father Micah's layered rhetorical moves (silence loops, white paint, paradoxical questions) narrow the entity's assumptions until possession becomes untenable. Closure is a Decisive Change—Elena's eyes become "her own"—with visible cost (both shaking, the white seal on her forehead). The causality chain is legible: each philosophical probe tightens the trap. Does not reach 8.5+ because the entity's internal logic (why these specific paradoxes work) remains slightly under-dramatized; we're told the effect more than we see the entity struggle against its own premises.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph (glass spire, frozen lake, dawn, Maya). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maya completes her dawn ritual and rests, the mirrored horizon dissolves, and the fortunes become "tiny conductors" for strangers. The cost is felt through exhaustion and the fleeting window, though it remains an iterated routine rather than a one-time decisive change. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes "the chronological homesickness was itself a fortune," reweighting her method. The ending image of the nautilus "hold[ing] the morning like a chambered memory" provides textural closure, but the stakes never meaningfully tighten—tomorrow she returns to the same work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Maya's repeated visits build density until the pattern breaks with her realization that the labyrinth has no center. Orientation anchors (inverted Maya on viaduct, tablet in hand, post-storm) arrive immediately. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—she shifts from "lost inside it" to "she was it"—with visible cost (she stops searching for a perfect self). The causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the tablet's sudden new message ("The labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited") feels slightly convenient rather than emerging from prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens through Mira's discovery of the drum maker's techniques leading to her experimentation and eventual student sessions. However, the closure—"a whisper, then a song, then a resurrection"—remains abstract and told rather than shown with a specific decisive change or felt cost on the page. The multi-week/seasonal time compression elides the key moments where choices narrow options or stakes rise. Orientation is adequate (deaf teacher descends into cavern in autumn/winter), but the causality chain lacks a visible pivot where Mira's agency forecloses a path with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean and early. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the courtyard's "layered tranquility" and Maren's method of "bearing witness fully" build toward a final stance crystallization rather than a causal reversal. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she commits to "recording the depths" and distributing complete documentation, a renunciation of simple refusal that forecloses direct confrontation with visible tactical cost (her data can be subpoenaed, but context will exist). The cost is legible: she accepts surveillance and potential legal pressure rather than hide evidence. One meaningful deepening (the pigeon's message reframes the follower's identity and stakes) tightens her approach, satisfying the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The grotto descent and pattern-uncovering establish coherent pressure, and the final image attempts Conceptual Repricing ("weaving a new one"). However, the closure relies on conceptual declaration ("learning to pattern their courage") rather than a legible on-page cost or trade-off; no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed. The ending reads as thematic summary instead of felt reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—trapped sounds, fragments, incompleteness—and pays it off through density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl placed upright, the chronic hush "learning to breathe again," with conceptual cost legible in the embrace of incompleteness and the violinist's departure without conventional resolution. Orientation anchors (violinist, greenhouse, post-fire world) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes what she needs to do and executes it, transforming trapped repetition into purposeful release.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, what) within the first two paragraphs. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren files the petal and prepares for the next client, accepting the cost to her own authenticity with visible resignation—"professionally thorough as always" gains ironic weight. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the blotter's symbolic charge, Thomas's transformation, and Maren's final self-application, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her role. One meaningful deepening (the turn from helping Thomas to confronting her own erosion) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the final paragraph's half-truth structure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under a Situational lens with accumulative elements: the misaddressed letter creates a meet-cute pressure that crystallizes into shared purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly (symphony → library terrace → stargazing). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership formed, purpose clarified) with visible social cost (commitment to public recognition work), though the cost feels more promised than paid on the page. The letter's journey from Marlena's office to Theo's hands provides a single meaningful tightening that narrows options toward collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when established early). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculptor realizes the search itself was the point and grafts herself into community), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than visible on the page—no forfeited path or enacted price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (weaving motifs of connection, weaving reeds, the search ritual), and the final image does reweight prior material. However, the revelation that "the tag had been there for weeks, perhaps months" lands as told retrospective rather than a dramatized turn that alters present stakes, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory detail, temporal motifs, and the cage discovery that reweights the echo concept. Orientation anchors early (gondola, rooftop canal, giant's nap timeframe). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"echoes weren't born from surfaces or distance…but from completion"—with felt cost (the pendant cools, borrowed time flows out). One meaningful deepening when she reaches the cages and reweights her investigation into action. The "interrupted cadence" concept charges the final image cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (mosaic, glass eyes, stalactites, flower) toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure where the mathematics reframe loss as transformation. Orientation anchors (cavern orchard, glass eyes, Marius) arrive early. The closure image—flower as proof, tears filling cracks—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (accepting irreversibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shoot emerges and delivers the insight. Cost is legible: he must honor transformation rather than recover what's lost, a foreclosed path made explicit in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two hidden people begin "the harder work of being seen" with the cost explicit in the renunciation of invisibility. The causal chain from power outage → security down → Maren's reveal is clean, and the orientation anchors (library, dawn, 4:47 AM) arrive early. One tightening: Maren's months of invisible survival versus her decision to matter. The lens is Causal with a lyric texture; it holds through the ending without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: Marcus's gradual release of control builds through repeated acts (cutting wires, removing stakes) toward a final image that reweights the nursery and his identity. Orientation is clean early. The closure—Marcus transformed by learning to surrender—lands with conceptual cost (his identity as controller is foreclosed) and the linden tree's relaxed branches offer a charged final image. However, the cost feels more asserted than visceral; we're told the nursery "flourished" and he "finally understood" rather than seeing a具体 price paid or a moment where the old self visibly dies.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transforming into agency): the painter shifts from exiled sleeplessness to chosen wakefulness, finding her subject in "the exhausted search for pattern" with the amber butterfly as charged final image. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—rain trails, brooches, and convergence pool meaning through density and cadence shift. Orientation anchors promptly (tidal island, post-war, painter at easel). The causality is clean: following rain trails → basin discovery → brooch exchange → distributed burden → sleep → waking choice to paint. Cost is visible: the redistribution of witnessing, the basin's re-drowning, the commitment to return.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Vera accepts unknowing with visible cost to her identity as clairvoyant predictor. The accumulative design builds through cave song → pearl hum → shadows pooling → new frequencies, then reweights at "she'd succeeded beyond all prediction." Cost is legible: her professional certainty is forfeited for "genuine surprise." One friction: the shadows' arrival mechanism remains abstract ("attracted by years of accumulated enchantment") rather than grounded in a rule the piece teaches; the causality reads more metaphorical than concrete, which slightly softens the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maris demonstrates the method, others follow, and the harbor's relationship to the sea shifts from fear to navigation. The cost is felt (she risks herself on uncertain routes) and the accumulative lens holds—fragments of vision coalesce into practical maps. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the valve represents three kinds of knowledge, reweighting her approach mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece opens with clear anchors (Mara, city, midnight) and follows an accumulative/situational lens: arrows → district → fortress → choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gates open and she must choose one truth. The closure—taking her grandmother's message and becoming a teacher—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), though the cost is more conceptual (lifelong commitment) than viscerally felt in the final image. The "she would spend the rest of her days teaching others" constitutes a before/after but reads summary-adjacent rather than a dramatized forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors orientation promptly (tower, clifftop, Elena) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: whale songs → tile discovery → visions → understanding → transcription builds density toward the autumn closure. The final image—Elena remaining to transcribe, having "learned that some symphonies required belief not in magic, but in connection"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is more asserted than shown on the page. The turn from flight to commitment reads as thematic claim rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options or exacts visible price, keeping this out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Vesper steps into "the space between dimensions, where all goodbyes waited to be understood," crystallizing her seventeen-thousand-year question with undeniable pressure. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—magnetic fields, fragment pulls, and dimensional glimpses layer toward a cadence shift at the threshold. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The cost, however, remains conceptual and promised rather than felt on the page; no specific forfeiture or tactical narrowing occurs in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira finds a third path between her father's forgery and rigid honesty, with visible cost in the form of professional risk and emotional labor documented on-page. Orientation is swift (funeral home, Mira, tools, tonight). The causal chain from Pavel's request → Mira's night of waiting → microSD recovery → documented return is clean and motivated. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the capsule and must decide how to frame the return; her choice to document truthfully forecloses the easier (forged) path her father would have taken.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (stationer, workshop, post-silence mountain town) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates detail—lamp hum, bonsai labyrinth, invented histories—but the closure (placing the invented history in the maze to "age") reads as continuation rather than a decisive tightening or reweighting. The invented girl's compressed-time journey offers a more charged image than the stationer's own action, and no on-page cost makes the before/after legible. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration attempted, but the final beat lacks the pressure or trade-off to land it cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words (woman, containers, low tide), so no deduction applied there. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—fragments layered toward a thematic reconfiguration. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the protagonist's tactics remain unchanged from first beat to last. The closure offers Charged Poise (keeper of erased histories) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page: no visible forfeiture, no option foreclosed, no price paid. The inferred lens holds, but the closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a closure that crystallizes into Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina's understanding reweights her career and the riddle's answer. Cost is visible in her commitment to document "tomorrow," foreclosing her prior debunking stance, though the cost could be sharper on the page. Orientation anchors late (observatory location and her nightly ritual take ~150 words to clarify), triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The riddle's answer arrives through assertion rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal linkage even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: the graffiti system → Marcus's warning → yellow streak error → cooperative insight → proposal → vote forms a clear because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands as Decisive Change (shift from resistance to cooperative negotiation) with visible cost (compromise replaces pure preservation). The final image—"hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope"—is stated rather than shown through concrete action, slightly weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (crater inspector, moonlit summit, three-hour window). The closure unit—Maya's act of preservation through chemical photography and her departure as the consortium arrives—qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible cost (she cannot save the crater but succeeds in documenting it). Causality holds under a Causal lens: beacons planted → sunrise triggers reactions → photographs develop → she leaves. The cost is felt (loss of Valentina, but images endure), though the final paragraph's "golden, eternal, and hers" tilts slightly declarative where the image could speak alone. One meaningful tightening present.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with sensory density, but closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the hummingbird is simply fixed, and Mara returns to her starting stance with no felt cost or foreclosed path. The Mercantile's departure offers atmospheric parallelism but does not reweight the repair stakes. The final image ("preparing for whatever came next") restates the opening rather than transforming it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors promptly (falcon arrival, outpost, atlas editor). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's understanding crystallizes in the final third, reweighting her mission from "where rivers begin" to "where they return," and her commitment to venture onto the ice tomorrow charges the ending with undeniable forward pressure. Cost is conceptual and felt—she inherits her predecessor's danger and isolation—but the decision to act remains one beat ahead of the page, limiting the visible price paid in the closure moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of walking + tuning-fork strikes and lands on a resonant image (bells ring true, people return). Orientation is clear by the archway opening. However, the closure lacks on-page felt cost: the bell tuner simply leaves "infinitely patient, cryptic as ever" with no visible price paid or option foreclosed. The "collapse would not come" is declared, not demonstrated through a decisive beat that reweights prior material with cost. The orientation test passes, but Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows what the tuner sacrificed or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Marina, submersible, trench temple) and the causal chain is clean: distress signal → discovery → vial memories → field collapse → rescue. The closure lands on the page with a legible decisive change (Thalia freed, temple fulfilled) and the final image reweights the material from solitary distress to shared ascent. However, the cost feels abstract—"they had captured something more precious than time" tells theme rather than showing a visible trade-off or foreclosed path at the ending beat. The inferred lens is Causal with an Accumulative accent at closure; it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early: lighthouse prison, Marcus imprisoned for inherited debt, three bodies will surface. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—copper light pooling, dust hovering, layers of reflection building toward "hush wasn't something you found, but something you became." However, no decisive action or renunciation occurs on the page; Marcus neither speaks nor refuses to speak in the present frame. The closure relies on interior realization ("trusted that when he spoke, someone might listen") without on-page cost or a crystallized stance that forecloses a path. The tideline creates situational pressure, but the ending hovers in anticipation rather than delivering a change.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive by ~120 words, so no penalty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers atmosphere and revelation toward a final image of "mournful elation"—but the closure lacks visible cost: Elara's acceptance of her role is narrated ("she would learn to grow miracles") rather than shown through a decisive action or renunciation with felt consequences. The "debt repaid, lifetime by lifetime" is promised in the future tense, not enacted on the page. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what Elara loses or forfeits in the final beat, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers sleepwalking discovery, textile creation, and communal participation toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (wharf, canyon, labyrinth). However, the closure unit—Mara joining the walkers—lacks visible cost; the council's reversal is told rather than dramatized, and the final image ("perpetual, communal becoming") asserts transformation without showing what Mara forfeits or risks. The tightening needed for RR at this length does not land with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's realization that "interruptions were not endings but transformations" reweights her prior wandering and the village's broken faith, and the sundial's shadowless operation crystallizes the new continuity. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through root/bone imagery, and the cadence shift from excavation-as-duty to sundial-as-communal-reset reconfigures the dominant stake (restoring rootedness). Cost is conceptual and relational: she will leave again, but the departure now forecloses her prior diaspora drift. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (village, orchard, catacombs, reburial task). One meaningful deepening: the priest's visit and communal reburial together elevate private rite to shared renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens is Situational-Accumulative hybrid: Maya decodes the chalk, meets the courier, and prepares the next cycle, with pressure cohering around preserving underground identity networks. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final image of Maya pressing graphite "leaving marks that would last just long enough" crystallizes her stance and reweights the ephemeral/permanent tension with felt cost (ongoing risk, deliberate impermanence). The cost is legible in the final beat, satisfying the Q2 closure gate, though the arc remains a single tightening rather than a decisive transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates separate conversational threads across weeks, then crystallizes them into a visible conspiracy pattern. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira stitches "a map of convergence" and prepares to act, reweighting her prior passivity with visible cost (she must now risk exposure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when she holds the embroidery to flame and sees routes, supply stations, and schedule converge "before the coup." Cost is legible in her decision to speak and the conspiracy's unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid causal-accumulative lens: the medium's ritual (gargoyle shard + moonlight + letters) triggers a memory-vision that reframes Isla's understanding, then produces the sister's letters as proof of mutual longing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Isla holds both letter bundles and runs toward reconciliation, the cost implied by five years of silence and the spirits' path. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than on-page forfeit—no dramatized sacrifice or tactical narrowing occurs in the final beats. The memory-space visit functions as revelation without complication, and the sister's letters arrive as deus ex without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (recovery center, post-surgery, twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered translation work (smudged cast notes, multiple languages, coral fragment) and the final offer to "unknot every story" reweights Maya's prior collecting of wounds into active preservation with felt cost (time, energy, reopening trauma). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Maya moves from passive cataloging to committed co-translation, forecloses solitary drift, and the cost is legible in her recognition of wounds she "didn't know how to heal." One meaningful deepening present.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: artist, ruined orchard, fog-soaked district. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Mira's realization that "joy wasn't lost in the past, waiting to be excavated. It was right here" reweights her artistic practice and the dominant stake (rediscovering lost joy). The cost is visible: she releases the need for permanence and embraces ephemeral connection, a meaningful shift from her opening state. The fog-as-developer metaphor and light-painting sequence build density that peaks in the final paragraph's reconfiguration of her relationship to erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes orientation quickly (restorer, garden, three years of work) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering nested awakenings that deepen the dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity). The hobo nickel discovery triggers the first tightening, and repeated "waking" cycles intensify pressure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marta chooses to embrace recursive dreaming rather than demand objective reality. However, the cost remains conceptual and felt rather than visible—no concrete forfeit or consequence appears on the page, only her smile and willingness to "begin again," which reads as liberation without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Situational hybrid—pressure accumulates through the premise (MindTax surveillance) and crystallizes in the final image of seeds versus towers. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the secret language has taken root, surveillance towers blink, cost is felt conceptually (risk of audit seizures, memory wipes). However, orientation arrives late—"Dr. Malachi Renn" and the greenhouse location aren't anchored until after the opening dialogue, creating brief disorientation. The escalation from proposal to distributed planting happens largely in summary ("Over the following weeks"), flattening what should be the story's central causal chain. The ending image reweights the premise but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized in a specific choice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, and when anchor by paragraph two. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through images (postcards, wind-song, bulb) and culminates in a cadence shift at closure when the poet "felt something close to rest." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final decision reweights centuries of solitary creation with collaborative hope. Cost is implied (collaborative risk, relinquishing solitude) but remains felt rather than dramatized on the page, which holds the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, what) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miren discovers the crack, descends to the archives, plays recordings to recalibrate, and fashions a new chime that creates harmonies. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her purpose amid the singing orchids with felt cost ("foxglove regret bloomed deeper now"). One tightening occurs when the cracked tube creates a new frequency, deepening the dominant stake. Causality remains clean; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Causal with accumulative accent. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the "together" promise reframes their diverging paths as interconnected rather than severed, with felt cost in the acknowledgment that tomorrow they separate. The ink well's transformation from "frozen tear" to "prism" charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael's initial unreadable expression dissolves into "old excitement," narrowing Maren's options from defensive explanation to collaborative restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the causal chain from envelope clue → chain measurement → hidden valve is clear and motivated. The closure—water flowing and communities standing together—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no visible sacrifice, no foreclosed path, no felt price for either village or Elena. The final image of "understanding dappled their faces" tells resolution rather than showing a decisive change with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal inciting incident → Accumulative texture → Resonant Reconfiguration at closure). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The recording device arrival provides motivated causality that narrows Elena's evasion options, and the confession forecloses her invented identity with visible cost ("words hurt like new growth, like old wounds reopening"). The closure qualifies as Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise: Elena speaks truth and waits to "see who comes back," crystallizing the risk with undeniable relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya steps through the threshold with understanding that "sacred meant not divine but irreversible," reweighting the opening question with felt cost (dissolution of the terrace, acceptance of non-return). The accumulative lens holds—grain patterns, weather codes, and necessary distances converge to reframe her parents' collapse. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the logbook reveals her mother's surveyor role and final entry, narrowing Maya's interpretive options and charging the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—patterns accumulate (jellyfish migration, coral clusters, ley lines, plankton bloom) toward a final resonance. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Mara's recognition that belonging emerges from convergence, not learning from others), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no path is foreclosed, no tactical price paid, no relationship altered by renunciation. The plankton bloom functions as cosmic validation rather than a pressure point that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs (cross-referencing charts with migration data), but the escalation from data work to luminous epiphany skips the friction that would make the insight undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (who, where). The piece accumulates pattern through repeated transliteration beats and tightens via the revelation that paths fade from lack of repetition, then shifts cadence in the final third when Calla plants the new seed and reframes her mission. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: "bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation." Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes restoration in favor of documentation—but the final image (palm against crystal, promise to remember) makes the reweighting undeniable and the piece teaches its accumulative method early.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (tidal arcade, Marina, performance space). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina orchestrates three micro-interventions that converge in a group photo, then withdraws. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she retrieves the bishop, folds her table, and moves deeper with "twelve minutes to orchestrate three more small miracles." The recursive structure (she'll do this again) reconfigures her stance from participant to perpetual architect, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; we don't see what she sacrifices by never joining the moments she creates.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Kael crystallizes her decision to become a living archive, and the final image of her dancing while inscribing memories carries conceptual cost (permanent marking, defiance that will provoke the Empress). Orientation anchors quickly (twilight garden, exiled tide dancer, post-nostalgia-ban). The accumulative lens holds—gathering moonstone dust, understanding the garden as chrysalis, choosing tattoo as archive—with one meaningful deepening when the speck touches her palm and her purpose clarifies. Cost is felt in the commitment to permanent bodily inscription and future confrontation, though the price remains more anticipated than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Samuel, prism atrium, pre-dawn, one week before demolition). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Samuel gathers evidence through repeated stone-drops, building a portfolio of light-patterns to argue for preservation. Closure is a Charged Poise—he walks away "carrying illumination in his satchel," the portfolio complete, stakes crystallized (will the developer see?) but outcome deferred. The cost is conceptual (he's staked his reputation on translating beauty) and felt in "the moment before everything shifts," though a sharper on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors adequately (Marcus, ridge, porcelain box, moonlight) by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/reflective lens: Marcus walks the ridge, reviews his father's writings, and reaches understanding. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (placing the box, adding his own entry, walking down with new understanding), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "bargain continues, but now I choose it knowingly" reads as thematic claim without visible consequence. The drive lens holds, but the ending lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (grotto, gauge, Maya's work) but the closure unit—Maya writing the formula and understanding hope—arrives as intellectual summary rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The parallel-timeline mechanics are asserted rather than taught through causality: we're told the gauge measures "depth of convergence" but never see how that measurement alters her tactics or forecloses an option. The ending offers thematic statement ("hope equaled the probability...") instead of an image that reweights prior material with felt pressure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece gestures toward resonance but the final beat abstracts rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure accumulates through ivy recoil → equipment anomaly → film negatives → acoustic pattern → building consciousness confirmed, then deepens when Mara understands Eleanor's burden. The closure—honoring dreams before walls forget—reconfigures the cartographer role with felt cost (the burden of knowing what no one believes). Orientation is clean by ~60 words (ivy passage, equipment, abandoned manor). One meaningful tightening occurs when the acoustic visualization reveals intentional modulation, altering Mara's stance from mapper to advocate. Cost is conceptual and emotional but legible in the final paragraph's shift from documentation to honoring.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror vigil as recurring ritual; orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to renewed purpose): the vision in the mirror reweights Aina's nightly practice from desperate retrieval to acceptance of possibility. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the shift from "entirely alone" to "no longer entirely alone," though the conceptual price could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the smallest mirror answers, crystallizing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the lens is Causal with symbolic overtones. The closure—planting seeds together and the promise to return—qualifies as Charged Poise: options crystallize (continued war vs. fragile collaboration) with undeniable pressure even though the social cost is deferred. The ritual mechanic is taught early and paid off at midnight, creating a clean tightening. One micro reversal (Threll's shift from brittle refusal to kneeling) narrows options and the final image reweights the clipboard from memorial to "fragile beginning."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marcus walks away after releasing the recording, renouncing witness to his own achievement with felt cost ("did not look back"). The piece operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: manufactured-drought backstory builds density, then the release beat shifts cadence and the rain's arrival reweights all prior destruction. Orientation anchors by line 2 (salt flat, Marcus Thorne, present action). One meaningful deepening occurs when the dove's call "sounded like water," crystallizing the ironic cost and charging the final image. Cost is legible on-page in the walk-away and thunder drowning the song.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear drive toward the prism sanctuary and delivers an on-page transformation when Celestine emerges "no longer constrained." Orientation is adequate by ~150 words (who, where, when established). However, the closure lacks visible cost—she simply walks away "ready to unlock others" with "alarming serenity" but no concrete price paid or path foreclosed. The causal chain is thin: she kneels, traces patterns, the sanctuary materializes through description rather than earned struggle, and she gathers echoes without resistance. The "threads" that "would never knot the same way again" functions as metaphorical assertion rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the performance and the drunk's epiphany reconfigures Marcus's understanding of his work. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening paragraphs). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marcus's realization about ethical storytelling reweights the premise), but the cost feels implied rather than sharply legible on the page—no tactical choice is foreclosed. The drunk's intervention provides the key turn, though Marcus remains largely passive, receiving insight rather than driving it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increase and pattern break reweight the dominant stake). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (grotto, Sera, three thousand feet, monarchs). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Sera completes her temporary structure and descends, forecloses permanence with visible renunciation ("already transiently rooted to her next forgotten place"). Cost is implied rather than sharply dramatized—her work will vanish in three weeks, and she leaves it behind—but the final image recharges "transiently rooted" and moth wings with conceptual weight. One meaningful deepening occurs (monarchs arrive, she builds, they depart), satisfying the lens. Escalation is steady but not tightened by a sharp turn, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of translation (rope → card → bronze) by the first third and deepens it through the aurora alignment discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of hearing bells crystallizes options and reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in "building something that would outlast her" and the years-long commitment. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when light patterns make "sound visible."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the premise (paths dream walkers into being) with felt cost (agency belongs to paths, not people). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the directive's meaning, the dream sequence, and the final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors early (bunker, storm, Hindsight's gift). One meaningful deepening occurs when the directive's meaning blooms and the dream reframes her understanding. The cost is conceptual and legible: free will is inverted.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Mara works through the night, layering astronomical translation until the pattern crystallizes into a message across millennia. Orientation anchors (palace, violet hour, post-regime chaos) arrive early. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tile reweights her solitary work into a covenant across time—with felt cost visible in her frugality, scarcity, and the looming regime change that will claim the palace. One meaningful deepening (ancient coordinates from an impossible perspective) tightens the mystery and charges the final image. Minor causality question: the "seventeen light-years distant" reveal lacks on-page verification or dramatized stakes shift beyond wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Elena's sanctuary, Marcus at threshold, reality shifting. The piece follows a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered metaphor (music box, cellular memory, shifting walls) and Elena's persuasive moves rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Marcus's weeping breaks the silence, signaling acceptance of grace), and the cost is felt: he relinquishes the identity-architecture of resentment. However, the RR depends heavily on Elena's uncontested assertions; Marcus offers minimal substantive resistance, so the "tightening" reads more as rhetorical accumulation than a pressure point that narrows his options through his own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp: who, where, and when are clear by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Eliane's understanding of Gregor's dream enables her capture method, and the closure—trapping the dream in the mirror and choosing to bury it—lands with visible cost (she must enter the fog, risk the dream's force, and carry the burden to the grave). One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream recognizes itself in her recreation and condenses. The cost is legible: she forecloses the dream's destructive potential by containing it, and the final image reweights the opening fog-and-glass motif.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Mara, crumbling stairs, searching six months). The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Mara's broken vows → Guild notice → search → confrontation → shared work, each step narrowing options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): tying the ribbon around both wrists creates a new, deliberate vow with visible cost (forsaking solitary craft for collaborative teaching). One meaningful tightening when Lisel's accusation forces Mara's admission and tool-sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara's realization that she will inherit herself backward reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (she is both curator and subject of the archive's logic). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered examples of nonlinear inheritance until the tree/cameo moment crystallizes the pattern. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cameo fits the tree, shifting her from bewildered to participant. Cost is conceptual and felt (she must eventually become her own grandfather), though the final image could make that price more viscerally undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The mountain's architecture and linguistic layering accumulate across beats (temporal rift discovery, diary consultation, harmonic bridge construction). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the students materialize and Mira's reflection reweights rescue missions as self-discovery cycles; the conceptual cost (eternal repetition, teaching through loss) is legible in the final image of the traveler disappearing again. Orientation anchors who/where by ~150 words ("arcane linguist," "Codex Mountain," "labyrinthine bookstore")—slightly late but functional. One tightening (rift → diary → bridge solution) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fog, carousel, emerald card, and spoken narratives layer toward a final density shift when the garden materializes. Orientation anchors (Isla, Celestine, foggy bay) arrive early enough. The closure—Isla stepping into the garden and recognizing her own names—operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the discovered), but the cost is asserted conceptually ("recapture meant release") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fog shifts in response to her storytelling, but the mechanics remain opaque and the final image relies on metaphor rather than stakes-altering action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, clock tower, 3:47 AM door). The accumulative lens coheres: Marin's research fragments build toward the ceremonial rope solution, and the closure—rebraiding the rope to merge timelines—lands on the page with visible consequence (her notebooks merge, Chen's name appears). Cost is conceptual and felt (seventy-three years posthumously, absence finally resolved) but remains slightly abstract; the "more solid, more certain" mechanism room registers the shift without a sharp before/after stakes trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mapkeeper sits in achieved balance, having restructured the caves' resonance with visible cost (exhaustion, the need to remap). The accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly—density increases through ice-pattern reading, harmonic layering, and the bloom's spread. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo stone warms and the bloom unfurls, reweighting the dominant stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mera completes the pattern and prepares to rekindle the beacon with the stars converging, crystallizing her stance that coincidences are meaningful. The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens—her methodical assembly of star paths, shadow discovery, and prism repair cohere into a singular act of defiant hope. However, cost remains conceptual and asserted ("nothing was ever truly coincidence") rather than legibly paid on the page; we don't see what she forfeits or risks in this final preparation. The structure is clear and the escalation builds through discovery beats, but the ending hovers in anticipation rather than delivering a felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph (archivist, observatory, after the fog became solid). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflections on memory's instability, shadow measurements, and collective recollection, culminating in the dawn image where Maris "remembered remembering." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final moment crystallizes her stance on memory-as-transformation without requiring a decisive external act. Cost is conceptual and felt (the impermanence of her summer-quill records, the mourning of the moment as it's lived), though the exact price could be more legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the fortress's sickness is established, Mara interprets the mosaic, executes her fireworks, and the ending offers a cadence shift ("cracked, letting light seep through"). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (blooming fortress, dusk, main gate). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise variant—where the fortress is "cracked" and the commander "stood straighter," but the cost remains mostly conceptual and understated; the felt price of Mara's labor or the fortress's partial transformation lacks sharp on-page legibility. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the cost proof test is borderline: we infer exhaustion and departure, but no sentence crystallizes a visible trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the pause between aunt and niece accumulates meaning through pool observations, the jade cicada, and shifting emotional cadence until the final reconfiguration transforms silence into presence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the pause reweighted from "uncomfortable" to "learning its particular texture") with felt cost—Mei's acknowledgment that she "wanted to hold you here" and Lin's pending departure. The orientation is clean (grotto, low tide, two characters established immediately) and the single scene window holds coherently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the jade cicada shifts the conversation's texture, narrowing toward mutual understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the gilded hush discovery reweights Lina's understanding of compression/expansion, and the descent with the "impossible cargo" crystallizes her stance against her father's bunker philosophy with felt cost—she returns to that world carrying proof of its opposite. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory textures of silence, then the flower's unfurling during inversion provides a decisive intensification that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (Lina, beanstalk trellis, inversion hour) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. One minor causal question: the flower sprouting from spilled water last month feels slightly convenient, but it's seeded early enough and the inversion-triggered bloom is causally linked to the gravity reversal, so the tightening holds.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the man's brief palm-press on the storm glass and Mara's final log notation reweight the premise (teaching silence to comfort) with visible professional ritual. Cost is oblique but legible—Mara's ongoing work carries the weight of "difficult passages, handled with care." Orientation is clean by ~120 words (gondola operator, floating terrace, seven years). The piece teaches its pattern (vignette of one arrival, bracketed by Mara's reflection) and the closure image reconfigures the storm glass from atmospheric device to emblem of shared transit. One meaningful deepening: the man's breathing slows, and his departure gesture converts observation into recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lore keeper, canyon, tonight deadline). The story follows a causal lens: scan waterfall → orchard → decode flake → peel paint → find door → ascend → choose not to claim. The closure is Earned Stasis (refusal to sit) with a conceptual price (remaining unclaimed "a while longer"), though the cost reads more asserted than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ruby flake warms and the wall opens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (ash, starlight, the ring, scars) toward a final image of collaborative destruction. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the phone on the ground and Maya's instruction crystallize a threshold moment—but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The reversal (Maya accepting a student) is signaled but not earned through prior friction; her three years of solitude dissolve without visible sacrifice or a dramatized internal tightening that would make the "careful encroachment of teaching" feel like a true foreclosure of her former stance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts a causal-situational hybrid: glitchy texts → bolt appears → threshold discovered → volunteer decision → fusion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately early. The closure unit—Maya fused to the bolt, holding paradoxes—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), but the cost remains abstract ("pressure" as metaphor) rather than a legible forfeiture or visible transformation on the page. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost Proof Test shows strain: the final image declares she "holds all promises" without showing what she loses or what specific tactic changes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing: the family fortune was never squandered but given away, reweighting four generations of accusation. The cost is conceptual and relational (absolution vs. treasure), legible in "transformed everything." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the gramophone paragraph. Causal lens holds: great-grandfather's recordings → Mara's physics intuition → standing waves reveal hidden compartment → deed discovered. One meaningful deepening (the fortune's true fate) is sufficient for this length, though the turn from mystery to revelation happens quickly without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers mystical patterns and alchemical imagery toward a final reconfiguration where "the endless night remained, but it was no longer a prison." Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the knight's stance crystallizes from isolation to engagement—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than pointed to a single on-page forfeiture or consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she enacts the second pattern and "reality shifted more dramatically."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through discovery beats—button, first file, second file, rolled list—culminating in Sarah's decision to create a permanent record. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she begins documentation work that reconfigures her relationship to grief and unknown histories, with visible cost (displacement of personal mourning into institutional labor). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One escalation deepening (the rolled list revealing court-martial) narrows options and charges the final commitment. Cost is legible in the decision to light another lamp and begin thorough documentation instead of processing her own loss.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with Mira escaping and transmissions complete, creating a before/after (archives now spreading versus suppressed). The cost is present but muted: she loses the archive room and must flee, yet the mission succeeds cleanly without visible trade-off in the final image. Causality is mostly clean (key → puddle-map → hidden room → upload → escape), though the convenient pre-revision transmission equipment and the Bureau's timing feel arranged. Drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressure; the lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of "vested hush" intensifies from childhood memory through grandmother's role to Elena's active maintenance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—she accepts the custodial cost and foregoes her public performance). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the architecture of silence and commits to it. Cost is visible: she walks away knowing she'll return each morning, her saxophone now "heavy with new purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (Miren, arbor, sorting work) arrive cleanly in the opening. The moonstone speck discovery initiates a causal chain (prod → moss patterns → monument building → realization), and the final image reweights the arbor's gray-to-shimmering transformation as metaphor for perpetual becoming. However, the cost remains conceptual and implicit—no on-page forfeiture of a prior path or visible price paid. The closure reconfigures meaning but the "she would begin teaching others" future-tense promise dilutes immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Ellis shifts from fixing clocks to witnessing temporal mystery, with visible cost (she leaves the shrine intact, altering her relationship to her trade). The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid—the pattern of 3:47 clocks provides accumulative texture while Ellis's choices (going to the conservatory, excavating, reading the journal, leaving everything) form a because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (workshop, conservatory, cavern). One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the compass rose and descends. Minor deduction: the coincidence of forty-seven clocks stopping at 3:47 strains credulity at the outset and risks reader buy-in, though the piece commits fully to the premise thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (foundry, Mira, post-search). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: alchemical images and the kintsugi principle gather weight until the ritual reweights Kael's disappearance into return. Closure lands on-page with Kael gasping and speaking, and Mira's realization about names as vessels offers Conceptual Repricing. However, cost is largely metaphorical—Mira sacrifices her wedding ring, but we never see what that marriage meant or what she forfeits by melting it. The "golden lines" on Kael function as visual proof rather than felt consequence, and his claim to have found "all" his names dilutes the specificity of what was at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered confessions, the harp's "wrongness," and the tooth's symbolic weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost glows and moves on). Orientation is swift (who, where, when by ~60 words). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost breaks script and laughs. Cost is legible but oblique—the ghost's release rather than Mara's sacrifice—which keeps this just below 8.0. The closure image reweights prior material (laughter threaded through tears) but Mara herself pays no visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening: Kira, violet forest, post-extraction timeline. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each memory surge deepens her engagement with the forest's responsiveness, culminating in the dawn insight that mercy is transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts her rewired state and commits to an incomplete mathematics with visible cost ("forever changed"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the forest's molecular response to her tears models the transformation she seeks. Minor slip: the middle surges feel slightly repetitive in their physical presentation, but each adds new material (the hesitant interrogator, the trees absorbing pain) that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: clues gather across paintings until the final revelation reweights the grandmother's method as recoverable technique. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mira grasps that translation means "insisting that every voice mattered"—but the cost remains abstract; we see resolve, not a visible forfeiture or confrontation that tests it. The market-to-workshop transition is clean, and causality holds (lens fragment unlocks hidden symbols, symbols yield coordinates and method). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final painting reveals the grandmother's face and the crowd of erased translators, shifting the quest from personal to collective.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The core causal chain—Marcus examines elevator → ghost reveals hidden evidence → Marcus retrieves photographs → ghost finds peace—is clear and motivated. Closure qualifies as Decisive Change (ghost released, truth surfaced) with conceptual cost (70-year injustice finally addressed). However, the closure effect lacks felt cost for Marcus himself; he experiences no meaningful tightening or trade-off, merely carries out a retrieval task. The mainspring barrel's fusion with the elevator mechanism is asserted but never constrains his actions or raises stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and the piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the library "learns to breathe" and the final image of frost patterns as "love letters from chaos" reweights the premise. However, the closure cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeit or visible price paid by Margritte or Tessian. The whisper's release produces immediate transformation without resistance or tactical adjustment, softening causal pressure. The ending reconfigures meaning but the felt cost remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (Matthias, baroque asteroid, post-revolution scholar). The piece accumulates pressure through layered realizations—mirrors trap storms, the builders were non-human, they too covered mirrors—culminating in the mirror-touch moment that reweights his scholarly struggle as cross-species grief. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes his stance with conceptual cost (academic isolation, ongoing dispute) made undeniable. One causality slip: the shard "remembers" light is asserted poetically but never constrained by mechanics, leaving the storm-vision mechanism vague when it should tighten tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Cornelius, resonance chamber, commission) arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates through the seven-box restoration and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the boxes play, covenant fulfilled). However, the cost is asserted rather than shown: no moment where a thread scatters, no box that resists, no price paid for the night's work beyond elapsed time. The closure image is resonant but the felt cost required for RR in this mode is not legible on the page—"warm and content" signals satisfaction, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara relinquishes the compass and accepts mystery as irreducible, foreclosing her prior extraction mode with visible cost (she collects but refuses synthesis). The accumulative lens is signaled early through sensory collection and holds through the lagoon sequence to the final image of the compass as offering. Causality is clean: compass → cliffs → lagoon → psychometry → collect/renounce. One tightening occurs when she realizes the scent "resisted capture," shifting her goal mid-sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Iris, archway, storm) within the opening and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered slide revelations, culminating in a methodology shift. However, the closure unit—Iris beginning her sculpture with the slide as compass—offers Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The line "a compass pointing toward connection rather than destination" articulates theme but does not show a visible forfeiture or altered tactic with immediate pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (slide reveals → navigation methodology), satisfying minimum escalation, but the cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a Conceptual Repricing) but the closure arrives as explanation rather than image. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph. The discovery of the etched glass functions as a reveal that Marina simply hadn't noticed before rather than a choice that forecloses options. The final painted pavilion offers a visual restatement of the grandmother's question but the cost—what Marina gave up or risked to achieve this understanding—remains invisible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph (floating library, Maya, three weeks prior). Causal lens holds: decoding triggers retrocognitive trap, which compels the final choice to complete the work and testify. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Maya moves from detached archivist to committed witness, with visible cost in her searing focus and loss of professional distance. The nested time structure (present frame → 1952 experience → return) remains legible, and the encrypted diary functions as both constraint and catalyst throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (history floods in, bottle cracks, potential disperses). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bottle's shattering reweights "revival" to "foundation of transformation." However, cost is asserted conceptually—"rejected the easy path," "work had only just begun"—not felt in a concrete forfeiture or altered relationship. The before/after legibility is present but the price remains oblique, keeping closure from full resonance under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when efficiently (venerable oath scribe, rooftop orchard, post-foghorn silence) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Miriam moves from "velvet disquiet" to understanding that the silence marks transition, not foreboding, and the orchard is "ready to remember something new." The cost is conceptual and felt—she bridges "what was and what would be"—and the closure image (her descent with hands "smelling of ancient bark and older promises") reweights the opening silence with accumulated meaning. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (wax shaving, tree memory, child's accidental prophecy) that converge to shift the emotional register of the silence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she speaks both versions of the prophecy and feels the tree's longing, reweighting her archival work as a bridge across time.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vortex opens through layered sensory and conceptual detail, and closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she refuses borrowed time and accepts the harder path with visible cost (leaving the collection unrestored, carrying only one seed). The withdrawal moment narrows options and forecloses restoration with felt opportunity cost. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Mira's weeks of tracking → discovery of the rope's resonance → solstice reading → choice to ring the bell rather than sound the siren forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she abandons mechanical protocol, risking panic and her role, and the sanctuary survives because of her listening. One tightening (the inversion building "within the hour") narrows options effectively. Orientation is clear by ~80 words. Cost is legible in her choice and the priest's acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift at dawn that reweights solitude and observation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Kael's nightly vigil transforms from exile-as-penance into a chosen stance of witnessing, with the cost legible in his ongoing solitude and the station's abandonment. The yellow glass revelation functions as a micro turn that deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the accumulative pattern. One structural seam: the backstory paragraph slightly flattens momentum mid-piece, but recovery is swift and the lens holds through the singing finale.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recursive observation (ghost's pattern, box mechanics, list revelation) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Silas commits to witness-keeping, foreclosing his prior aimless exile with visible cost (ongoing duty). The tightening is meaningful—discovery of the list reweights his isolation from self-imposed exile to sacred task. Cost is legible in the final image: he will remain, tending memory.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors are established early (emerald silo, Marcus, prairie setting). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus gains Chen's framework and commits to teaching it, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no on-page forfeiture or visible tradeoff. The projection device delivers the turn via convenient exposition rather than protagonist agency. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (poetic measurements, sensory framework), but the ending summarizes future intent rather than reweighting prior material through a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Maya adds the morning to her collection without an ending, and the young man commits to return with his fragments—both accept incompleteness with visible cost (his lost kite, her perpetual unfinished collection). The accumulative lens holds: rain → broken feather → snapped string layer meaning cleanly. Orientation anchors early (lagoon, dawn, Maya's routine). One meaningful deepening occurs when the kite snaps and he laughs, reweighting his relationship to brokenness. Cost is legible in the young man's forfeited kite and his acceptance that he cannot write "the way I used to."

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates understanding through incremental discoveries (diary notes, pillar-tree symbiosis, copper technique) and closes with Resonant Reconfiguration—Marina's death becomes Earned Stasis where her renunciation of extended life is reweighted as integration into the system she restored. Orientation anchors cleanly (island, temple, Marina, terminal prognosis) by ~80 words. Cost is visible: she exceeds prognosis but dies, having traded treatment for purpose. The pattern of discovery-to-restoration coheres and the final diary entry charges the closure image with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (tower, amber, footprints, formulae in dust) toward a Conceptual Repricing where the chemistry metaphor reweights homecoming as transformation. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The closure reconfigures the protagonist's understanding with conceptual cost (her skepticism now "illuminates something different"), and the final image—footprints fading, formula remaining—charges prior material. One meaningful deepening (discovery of footprints leading to convergence point) tightens the journey from hypothesis to recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: layered imagery and linguistic fragments build toward a final vision of "beauty learned to swim." However, closure lacks visible cost—the garden's future arrival is asserted, not earned through on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when emerge gradually across the first third), applying a −0.4 penalty. The accumulative pattern is legible but the ending remains a poetic wish rather than a reconfiguration with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens dominates: cylinder arrives → Finder decodes voice and grooves → coordinates lead west → reunion with Crow. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two retired trackers sit together, translating distance into closeness through riddles that are "bridges to build," with the conceptual cost visible in their shared need to relearn hope after horror. Orientation anchors early (bloodhound, scrapyard, phonograph). One meaningful tightening when the leaf's veins reveal coordinates. The final image of glowing leaves and "connection was still possible" carries felt cost—they spent years apart, and the riddle structure itself encodes the difficulty of bridging that gap.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (observation deck, time dilation, sketching custom) and accumulates density through charged repetitions of the compass rose and sketching act. Orientation anchors (who, where, when, why) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kira's final choice to continue sketching "the night sky that would never stop changing, creating constellation maps for a future that would never arrive" forecloses reunion and accepts solitude with visible cost—her family now "dust for millennia." The cost is conceptual and temporal, undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "True north wasn't a fixed point…it was whatever you chose as your reference."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Seren, corrupted sky, sundial failure). The piece follows a causal lens: sundial stops → climb → swap pieces → sky fixes, with each move motivated. Closure is a Decisive Change (sky repaired, shadow returns, apprentice becomes keeper) with felt cost (she must now bury the lies, stand alone). One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she might choose wrong. The cost is visible in the final image of solitary responsibility, though the ease of the fix slightly undercuts the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its method early (chessboard discovery, walking interviews, acoustic memory) and accumulates density through the interregnum's suspension, building toward the final image where "small gestures refused to die." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's work continues in the luminous absence, crystallizing her role with felt cost—she has abandoned all other survival paths to become this singular archivist. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Mara in whispering gallery during interregnum). One slight density lapse: the colleague's scene could tighten, but it serves to articulate her transformation and does not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Isla, bookstore-mountain, three years post-trauma). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: nightly memory substitution → stone discovery ritual → feather-触发 breakthrough → valley-memory flood → seed metaphor → book creation, with each beat deepening the texture of "home as practice." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed/belonging insight that reweights her exile, and the final image of sprouting words charges prior material. Cost is felt (grief quieting, acceptance of scattering) but could be sharper—there's no on-page moment where she visibly relinquishes a concrete hope (e.g., returning to the physical valley) in favor of this new practice, which keeps the ending in the strong but not exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative/Textural texture: Elena decodes the tapestry's frayed threads, each decoded strand narrows the labyrinth path ("turn left at pride, right at shame"), and her voiced self-forgiveness triggers the village's temporal release. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she frees the village and herself, yet "still exiled, still disgraced." Orientation anchors quickly (village, chapel, tapestry, Elena's exile backstory by ~15% mark). One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the final sequence requires complete self-forgiveness, forcing the peak choice. The causal chain holds cleanly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: Mira layers poetry through the night to scatter truth, and the canyon's amplification becomes the turn. Orientation anchors quickly (bone towers, canyon, artist, tomorrow's ritual). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she gathers her paints knowing she won't use them, walks toward the spire accepting singular truth—visible cost, coherent under the lens. One meaningful deepening (amplification replaces scattering) tightens options with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the wave strikes, the workshop holds, and Mira commits to continuing her work—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where uncertainty becomes a vessel waiting to be filled. The causal chain is tight: collecting essences → discovering the statue's pattern → matching them under time pressure → golden fusion that buoys the workshop. Orientation is swift (workshop, acid sea, task established in opening beats). One meaningful tightening occurs when the rising wave forces the final placement with visible cost (her own uncertainty poured in).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Marina's immersion and declaration to the gallery owner reweight her twenty-year pattern with felt cost (abandoning safety, ruining clothes, rejecting reflection). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through cave discovery, shell placement, and final stance shift. Causality holds: wrong turn → hidden chamber → Thomas's letter recalled → immersion choice → gallery declaration. One meaningful deepening (cave realization) tightens options. Minor deduction: the gallery knock feels slightly rushed after the cave's lyric density, compressing the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse, dawn, Mara, Silas dying, Vera arriving). The vial ritual and Mara's ascent to light the beacon accumulate pressure toward the whispered apology, which crystallizes options and reconfigures the seven-year silence with felt emotional cost. One meaningful deepening (understanding Silas's lesson) tightens the stance. Minor causality slip: the scent's mechanics ("purifies intentions") are told rather than shown altering Mara's on-page choices, relying on interior assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: repetition of midnight calls, the bronze censer foot, moon phases, and star imagery accumulate toward the final waiting posture. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraphs. Closure unit is Charged Poise—Mara waits, maps ready, the work continues—but the cost is more conceptual atmosphere than a legible on-page forfeiture or tightening that narrows options. The piece builds texture and tone but does not deliver a decisive pressure point or meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stands on the bridge with private fear, then commits to searching for others who need "their doors returned"—a stance that reweights her isolation into mission with visible cost (continued storm-exposure, authority risk). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece deepens through layered reflection (virus history, textbook study, neighbor encounter) that tightens pressure on the present choice. One meaningful intensification: pressing the eye to her temple after the neighbor's tears. Cost is felt in "fractured kind of grace, this rebuilding" and the forecast of continued danger.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Margit at the opal dock, three days post-discovery, at nautical twilight. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: each borrowed memory deepens the weight until the final release reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Margit releases the flower and the memories leave her, replaced by her own solitude now "lighter." The causal path from discovery to investigation to understanding to release holds, though Ernst's backstory arrives via memory-dump rather than dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph (Marcus, his shop, "three days" of rain, midsummer twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: signs converge (creek, light, ants) until the doorway materializes, and Marcus's choice reweights the lingering promise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he steps through "into his decision," crystallizing options with conceptual cost (leaving the maps, the "comfortable isolation"). The cost is felt but abstract; the final image charges the ending without a concrete forfeiture dramatized on the page. One tightening (the convergence of signs) deepens the stake sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (queen, palace, dreams). The causal chain is present: dreams → messengers → climb → grotto → vision → decision to return. The closure lands on the page as a reconfiguration (disenchantment → purpose), and the old woman's intervention provides a turning point. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral—what the queen sacrifices or forecloses by returning is implied but not concretely dramatized. The "bleeding starlight" visions show branching futures but don't narrow her options through a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands clearly through Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's decision to stay and collaborate forecloses her capital career with visible cost (abandoning profitable work) and reconfigures the relationship from separation to shared purpose. The causal lens holds: her return was motivated by the columella curl's meaning, Kael's revelation changes stakes, and her gift of the pocket-suns demonstrates earned capability. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the secret is whispered, shifting from reunion to urgent collaboration with the six-month clock.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara, lucid dream chronicler), where (ranger cabin, eight thousand feet), and when (after finding her grave, time now scrambled) within the first two paragraphs. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through density of impossible moments—grave sighting, shuffled time, dream-waking bleed—culminating in the final image where the lamp's status itself becomes uncertain, reweighting all prior documentation with conceptual cost. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final line "or had already burned out, or would never be lit at all" reprices the entire chronicling enterprise, making the cost undeniable. One minor tension: the middle loses slight traction in a catalog of impossibilities before the ending tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal accent in the dialogue exchange that narrows Elena's understanding. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena's final walk with the clock reweights her grandmother's object and her own purpose, and the cost (accepting a transformed identity) is felt on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mr. Chen reveals his mother's tools and Elena connects it to her own loss. The lens holds, though the ending paragraph states the theme overtly rather than trusting the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Kael transforms scars into a rune with visible cost (exposure, vulnerability) and Master Yerin's recognition crystallizes the new stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (scars, frost, rune) that reweights the dominant stake (proving worth) with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the grandmother's superstition reframed as transformation lesson) tightens the stakes and charges the final image. Cost is legible: "scars visible and their breath crystallizing in the light like captured stars."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Mira in the archive facing demolition, Derrick's arrival, the fifteen-year wound. The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "not friendship yet, maybe never again. But something real existed"—the apology is delivered, partially received, and the cost (lost years, incomplete repair) is undeniable on the page. Causal lens holds: Mira's column betrayal → estrangement → impending demolition forces the meeting → apology → tentative acknowledgment. One clean tightening when Derrick says "I don't forgive you...But I'm glad you came" forecloses easy reconciliation with felt relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who (Kael), where (temple library), and when (indefinite "centuries") anchor by the opening paragraph, satisfying the ~120-word guideline. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered reflections spiral toward a final realization. However, the closure unit—"He had always been walking home. Now he simply knew it"—relies on summary epiphany rather than an on-page image or action that reweights prior material with visible cost. The Conceptual Repricing is asserted but not dramatized, weakening closure legibility. No meaningful tightening occurs mid-piece; the walk remains metaphorical throughout without a reversal or complication that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two). The piece accumulates through water imagery, whistle protocol, and the horizon motif, then delivers a Conceptual Repricing at closure: clocks measure attention, not time, and the protagonist stops counting. The cost is conceptual (renunciation of measurement) and the final image reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the key fits and the pendulum reveals the truth. Causality is loose—why does counting backwards unlock this truth?—but the accumulative lens permits pattern over strict because/therefore logic.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mira, library reference desk, post-heart-attack weeks) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira crystallizes her teaching stance and accepts working with her father through uncertainty, foreclosing the path of theoretical distance. The cost is felt—she steps into the contradiction she once avoided. One meaningful deepening occurs when she interprets the notebooks and realizes knowledge and behavior diverge; this reweights the dominant stake (understanding her father and herself). Lens holds; cadence shifts at the end with the syllabus and the visit decision.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure image ("proof that nothing truly ended") offers thematic repricing but lacks visible cost on the page—Iris ends where she began, smiling in her circle of light. The loop structure is taught early and held through, qualifying as Accumulative, but no meaningful tightening occurs: the seventh-night intervention is summarized rather than dramatized, and no choice forecloses a path. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. The piece reads as a single continuous ritual rather than a pressure-driven arc, meeting Accumulative criteria minimally but not achieving the density increase or cadence shift that would charge the final image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's decision to continue archiving transforms from penance to affirmation, foreclosing the mausoleum path with visible cost (she must now face her daughter's memory rather than hide). The walnut-ink ritual deepens the pattern, and the final image—carrying laughter home—reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening through the locket's reframing is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: who (Vera), where (railway station), what (logistics crisis) by the satellite phone opener. The structure follows a single continuous scene with one meaningful deepening: Vera's jocular mask falls when the young man names her loneliness, shifting her approach from performance to genuine presence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final moment crystallizes her realization that connection, not logistics, addresses loneliness, with the cost legible in her unmasked vulnerability. Causal lens holds; the young man's question ("Why are you...the one who cares") motivates the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through gathered musical notes, intensifying vibrations, and deepening sensory absorption until the stillpoint arrival reweights all prior material. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara kneels, accepts coexistence of love and grief, and stops fleeing—with felt cost: she forgoes further cartographic mastery and embraces presence over control. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when notes accelerate and the melody completes, narrowing her search to a single coordinate. Cost is visible in the final image: "her inner cartography finally complete" signals renunciation of endless mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure operates as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights her earlier "mistake" into contingent multiplicity, and the cost is conceptual—she relinquishes singular certainty. The piece teaches its pattern early (bent light, quantum superposition) and pays it off when she sends seven versions and the settlers adapt. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers relational interpretation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The causal chain from pen discovery to signal revision to settler response reads cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered observations (water ripples, wind patterns, moonlight pulse) toward a final cadence shift where Marina moves from framing to embodying rhythm. Orientation anchors (harbor, pier, Marina with camera, months after meeting Celeste) land clearly within the first 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marina's shift from "trying to remember" to "discovering," crystallized in the dance) with felt cost (world has forgotten her, she accepts this). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina lowers the camera and begins to move. The cost at closure—"she'd never truly needed to be remembered"—reads as acceptance with opportunity foreclosed, meeting the RR standard.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Marina's upload decision crystallizes her transformation from conservator to arsonist-activist, and the cost (permanent exile, criminal status) is felt even if not yet paid. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sensory details (carved narratives, tapestry fragment, ruined portrait) build density toward the final documentation act. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the vandalized portrait and decodes Kiran's embedded message, reweighting her prior arson from destruction to targeted curation. However, the two-year search and the archive discovery are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maya enters, drums, remembers, and leaves with density building through layered imagery. Orientation anchors clearly (Maya, garden, pre-dawn) within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she will "return tomorrow night to make them sing again"—with the felt cost of carrying thirteen lifetimes and the weight of "auroral sorrow." One deduction: the final paragraph's "Because that's what guinea pigs do" shifts into overt thematic summary rather than letting the image carry the cost, weakening closure purity by ~0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one), and the causal lens holds: Mira's whispers → Voss approaches → negotiation → guided hunt → arrest → payoff (the name). The closure unit is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Mira trades her labor and reveals her deductive method to gain leverage over Harbor Authority, forecloses her anonymous safety, and walks away with the promise of information that will reopen her father's case. However, the cost feels slightly abstract—she "slips away" without on-page consequence, and the final image ("she walked through them like she belonged—because… she did") asserts mastery rather than showing a before/after tension. One meaningful tightening (storm → access code → servers) is present, but the escalation is more procedural than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (cobalt dock, canal, twilight, Mara + guardian). The piece follows a causal lens: Mara's witnessing the light patterns → understanding her own darkness → confession → brother's rescue. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian points downstream, narrowing her options to speak or let silence drown them both. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (she must confess and guide the searchers), and the final image of her learning the patterns reconfigures her role from secret-keeper to future guardian. The ending leans slightly didactic ("some guardians teach not through words...") but the action sequence preceding it earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the rebellion accumulates through synchronized displays, grotto gathering, and the final classroom return. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the children's renewed questioning), but the cost remains implied rather than dramatically legible—Marina faces no visible sacrifice, and the "humble rebellion" succeeds without friction. The because/therefore linkage is soft; the town's response and children's transformation are told outcomes rather than on-page turns that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, context by the second paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's nightly ritual, the island's emergence, the scrimshaw discovery, and the whale's call layer toward a reweighting of her identity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she renounces the fighter identity and accepts the dancer—with felt cost in the line "I was never meant to be a weapon." The cost is more emotional than tactical; the story would benefit from a harder external consequence tied to the release, but the reconfiguration is legible and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maya's decision to reach for the bouquet and cease narration forecloses the performed-distance path with visible cost (petals disintegrate, narration stops, "only absence, only the beginning of something"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through interwoven description, backstory fragments anchored in present stimuli (flowers, knife, wood), and a cadence shift at the ending that reweights "lightness" from evasion to permission. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the third paragraph (who, farmhouse kitchen, post-Mandate present). One micro turn—voice crack—sets up closure without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through sensory intensification (humming deepens, lake groans, quartz warms) and paraphrase acts that reweight the ancient phrases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Lyren writes "until her tremor of certainty became a foundation," crystallizing her stance with the atrium's approval—a Charged Poise moment where options are reconfigured. The cost is conceptual (refusing council authority) and felt in the "tremor" becoming solid, though the price could be more concretely legible on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when her paraphrases shift the humming and she feels the boundaries dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors immediately (glassblower's courtyard, Mira, post-phoenix). The accumulative lens is coherent: plant arrangement → paintings → hidden vase → barter agreement form a tightening around accepting imperfection. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Fen commits to "beautiful failures" and Mira adds the "sprig of new growth," reweighting the phoenix motif from renewal-as-perfection to renewal-as-acceptance. Cost is conceptual but legible—Fen forecloses his forty-year perfectionism, Mira shares her unique vision. The middle lacks a sharp reversal; the vase reveal feels more like confirmation than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the corrupted-fragment layering builds pressure toward a conceptual repricing where "loss creates its own geography" reweights the artificial pilgrimage premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell ringer's demonstration forces Karim to see the data as discovery rather than failure, narrowing her options from restore-or-abandon to honor-the-corruption. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the laboratory "finally alive with purpose" crystallizes the new stance with felt cost (the original therapeutic vision abandoned). Minor slip: the phrase "connection wasn't something lost to be found, but something continuously created" edges toward theme statement but remains anchored in the collaborative act.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's sustained nocturnal work and the finished pendant crystallize her rebuilt equilibrium with visible emotional cost ("finally, like she was learning their language"). Causality is clean—materials arrive, she transforms them, the pendant ships—but pressure remains flat; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece runs Accumulative/Textural in method, yet the final image reweights prior grief without a sharp turn or deepening that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation cleanly (Mira, loft, post-crypto-crash present) within the opening paragraph. Pressure accumulates through the wall of connections, grandmother's journal revelation, and Mira's escalating insight about predictable crash patterns. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final rain image reweights the opening skylight motif, positioning human pattern-seeking as subject to "laws as immutable as any her grandmother had ever measured"—a quiet CR with conceptual cost (determinism vs. agency). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira confides her discovery and stakes shift from documentation to potential prediction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of walking away reweights the entire premise (preservation as poison) with felt cost—innocence lost, knowledge held silent. The causal lens holds cleanly from discovery through realization to renunciation. One tightening occurs when atoms activate and reveal civilization's fate, narrowing Maressa's options from "pursue and document" to "understand and suppress." Cost is legible in "her innocence gone but her humanity intact," though the decision beat itself could be more visceral. Orientation anchors early (saffron-veil historian, twilight, pagoda).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates detail around hope's erosion and lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the stone pressed to glass, smudge fading, "most honest thing she'd documented all day"—that reweights the documentation work with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Maren, library, profession). The closure image carries conceptual weight (authenticity vs. archival performance) but the cost remains oblique; Maren's situation is unchanged, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: quiet observation layers toward a conceptual repricing at dawn. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph; the single-scene frame holds. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the drafting of reports and the promise with Prism crystallize a new stance with visible cost (prestige, security, comfort). Cost is legible in the enumeration of what she sheds, though the final image relies more on assertion ("something settle in her chest") than a charged physical or relational detail that makes the price undeniable in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: coffee-ring reading, plant telepathy, and the hourglass accrue density until the final image reweights healing as "delivered exactly where it needed to go." Orientation anchors (Maya, tower, post-surgery) land by line 2. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya's hands warm, the hourglass resumes, and she channels healing into the ivy with visible cost (acceptance of her fragmented attention, the persistent scar). One meaningful deepening occurs when she reinterprets the gap in the coffee ring. Cost is legible: she must accept imperfection and her gift's altered form.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Marina catalogues film strips across forty-seven nights, building toward a density shift when she spreads them all and projects them. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image of love "speaking itself into the dark" reweights her vigil with purpose and delivers felt cost (her role as keeper/translator is now irrevocable). Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, why by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the love is incubating, not trapped, which shifts her from searcher to conductor.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (archway, Lyra, aurora). The piece establishes an Accumulative lens through layered imagery—aurora, astrolabe, meteors—that builds toward a threshold moment. However, the closure lacks legible cost: "Lyra finally allowed herself to rest" suggests release rather than foreclosure. The ending grants cosmic wish-fulfillment ("creativity spilled into the world like rain") without dramatizing what she loses or what path she can no longer walk. The trajectory follows a steady intensification but delivers conceptual satisfaction without on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the guard's singing, the chess clock warming, a wave function collapsing, and the clock ticking forward—one meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her ongoing cultivation with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual and somewhat diffuse rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Kael decodes his externalized mind-forest through systematic unraveling, building toward a conceptual repricing of his sixth sense as gift rather than curse. Orientation anchors (bronze canopy, gear, mechanical trees) land early and the closure reweights the premise with visible cost—he accepts perpetual wandering as necessary exploration. The cost is conceptual but legible: he must abandon the controlled academic life for continuous inner-landscape drift. One weakness: the "dawn breaking in the real world" pull feels asserted rather than dramatized, softening the closure's grip.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The seven-station structure teaches its pattern early and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Maya recognizes her courage was present all along and receives permission to redirect it, with the brass punch transfer signaling a reweighted future. Orientation is clear by the trailhead opening. The cost is felt—seventeen years acknowledged, dreams set aside—but remains largely reflective rather than a present-tense forfeiture that narrows options on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guides' marking reframes each sacrifice as courage rather than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors early (cobalt fortress, bellhop, three months, post-accident). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers discoveries (bolt, ash marks, Silent Choir history) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Marta's decision to remain and sing reweights the silence with visible cost (she forgoes leaving, commits to defiance). The closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—her stance crystallizes around active remembering, and the cost (remaining, risking management's ire, carrying the weight) is legible in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the ash marks and understands the unpardonable silence, which then drives her final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~100 words; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly as Kael's task-driven moves—grinding ink, inscribing runes, sending the Chronicle—accrue pressure toward the library's dissolution and Orian's unmasking. Closure lands on-page: Kael fades into memory while Orian reads the rune and "understood that he had already lost"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the cost (Kael's dissolution, the library's end) is visible and the false king's defeat is crystallized. One meaningful deepening (the final message to Orian) tightens options and forecloses her continued existence with felt cost. The causal chain (each inscribed message plants doubt → final Chronicle triggers recognition) is legible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, when anchored within 60 words). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through data layering, tapping rhythm, atlas markings, tidal cycles, and the final reweighting of "recovery" as memory-driven restoration. The closure is Conceptual Repricing—the ocean assembles itself into what it had always been trying to become—with conceptual cost legible in the understated admission that humanity interrupted. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes the paths aren't disappearing but returning, a tightening that narrows her interpretive frame and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words cleanly. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through stone-hum-starlight layering until the final paragraph reweights "paused rebellion" as cosmic patience, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (she must convince others of an unprovable hum-frequency insight). The escalation is a single decisive deepening: her perception shifts from defeat to resonance, narrowing her next move to ritual gathering. Cost is legible in "unsure if she was prophet or fool" and the stakes of tomorrow's persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (volcanic springs, post-war reconstruction, Lira). The piece follows a causal lens: kite discovery → decoding via plant communion → cave location → unsealing → acceptance of the midwife role. One meaningful tightening occurs when the amber shatters and the embryo begins to grow, narrowing Lira's options to accept or flee. Closure lands on-page with her "Yes," though the cost—what she's risking or foreclosing—remains more asserted than felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Layla, arboretum, dawn, clifftop). The helicopter beat forces a stance crystallization via the pearl ritual; the return to cuttings afterward is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—endurance that forecloses escape with felt cost. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: she presses into soil knowing "it was enough... it had to be... almost was" reweights the opening's "quietly talented" survival into a daily renunciation. The inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with clear closure: Elena's realization that fragmentation is truth rather than failure, with the cost being her abandonment of conventional portraiture. The walls contracting provide external pressure that escalates logically. Orientation is established early (lighthouse library, present tense). The closure lands on-page with the decision to "paint differently now" and the acceptance of the broken box, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in terms of what she's actually giving up professionally or personally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael's decision to follow reweights the opening anger and brother's death with undeniable cost (she will "disappear too"). The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: spilled ink → patterns → drone footage → understanding of the target's method → Kael's resolve. Orientation anchors (Kael, wind-carved encampment, post-eclipse) are present early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drone footage reveals the target stepping into patterns, narrowing Kael's options to pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: the letter's arrival → recognition of living conspirators → Kael's choice to activate → network awakening. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (she presses transmit, archives awaken) and visible cost is legible in "no matter the cost" and the echo of her mother's execution. The "within the blink that follows surprise" pivot is clean, narrowing options from preservation to release. One deduction: the meteorite delivery mechanism is introduced but never explained or constrained, creating a small causality gap that the story does not address.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis plus micro-turn: the father's choice to learn gentleness forecloses his former path with visible cost (he kneels, the killer becoming student). The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens through imagery and pattern (canvas scraps, repeated "engraved quiet," the dome's atmosphere) that culminates in the final image of roses learning alongside them. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One escalation beat (the hand moving to the knife, then sheathing it) tightens the dominant stake (can violence transform into care?). Cost is legible in the father's posture and role reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: Mira follows the wrongness → produces anti-sound → pins the echo → brings it home, each beat linked by because/therefore pressure. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (the goddess's laugh transliterates silence into speech), and the constellation sleepwalking frames the disruption that enables the hunt. Orientation is swift (skiff, garden, Orion drifting). One hairline slip: the mechanics of "voicing silence" arrive late and could have been primed in an earlier micro-choice to tighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: the journalist's call triggers Adelaide's ascent and reflection, which leads to the decision to meet him, then the photo analysis, and finally the commitment to publish. The closure is a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (family credibility damaged, legacy mythology exposed). Orientation is clean early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Adelaide applies her contradiction method and realizes the premise is false, narrowing her options to either protect or correct. Cost is legible in "Legacy without truth is just mythology" and the decision to run the story, though the final star image dilutes slightly rather than sharpening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (laboratory, Mira, translation device acting strangely). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—letters, firmware messages, and amber converge to reweight Mira's relationship to her past—and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she stops running, rests among the voices). Cost is implied through the sacrifice of the amber pendant and the easing of lifelong dissonance, but the final image is more atmospheric than materially consequential. The late reveal that her mother kept her undermines prior causality; the firmware and letters function more as oracular devices than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when cleanly by the opening paragraphs, avoiding orientation debt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the mandala's construction and the woman's arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the synchronized breathing and the mandala as "map of all their beautiful, necessary confusion"). However, the closure unit lacks a sharp, legible cost—the "slow, strange rebirth" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. The causal link between placing the tile flake and the deepening hush is poetic but mechanically opaque, weakening the sense that this exact sequence was necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal structure: Vessa discovers truth via retrocognition → weighs exposure → chooses concealment, creating a legible before/after. The closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (carrying the truth as burden), though the escalation is primarily internal reflection rather than mounting external pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she removes the tessera, foreclosing the path of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (stage ghost, antique shop, after closing) and establishes a clear accumulative lens: echoes produced by song will reverberate into the young man's tomorrow. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the tarot coin settles on the Star, blossoms bloom across decades, and Celeste smiles in anticipation—but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than legible on the page. The young man's discovery of his grandfather's sketchbook is narrated as a vision of tomorrow, not a causal consequence visible now, which softens the closure's immediacy. One meaningful deepening occurs (her performance crystallizes the fractured timeline), but the final image charges hope without a visible forfeiture or trade-off that alters her present condition.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the opening premise (telepathy pills as shortcuts) is reweighted by the ending's "way to make visible what had always been invisible," with the cost felt in "hope...delicate as willowglass, ready to shatter but somehow holding." The causal lens holds—static shock → muscovite experiments → light-painting lexicon—with one meaningful deepening (discovery that pathways form a language). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat. The three-week montage compresses what could be dramatized beats, slightly diluting escalation pressure, but the through-line from loss to diagnostic breakthrough remains legible and the final image reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory data, reflection on transformation, building toward a stance crystallization. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Mira suspended between worlds, mapping the unknown—but cost remains abstract ("witness," "give it voice") rather than a tangible forfeiture or reweighted constraint on the page. Orientation is clean (cave, Mira, post-hibernation) by the first paragraphs. The piece deepens through layered imagery but the final moment doesn't reconfigure prior material with undeniable pressure; it restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Maren's systematic cataloging unscrambles the echo, which leads to public revelation. The closure lands on the page with a visible act (gathering the town, playing the echo, sharing the ledgers) and the cost is legible in the final image—she has "unsealed the future by revealing the past's true shape." One meaningful tightening occurs when the jar clarifies against the arranged buttons. The lens holds, though the escalation is gentle and the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: snow-code discoveries layer across months, building pressure through pattern and the protagonist's shifting interpretation of "Fix what's broken." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Claire's "When do we leave?" crystallizes her return to agency and forecloses the ghost-life option with felt cost (the safe anonymity she built). Cost is visible in the renunciation of eighteen months' refuge. One minor linkage slip: Marcus's survival and his snow-writing method are told rather than discovered through on-page beats, creating a small causality seam in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (coachman, fog-bound crossing, woman in coach). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog thinning and rain gutters slowing create density and cadence shift that reweight the woman's stake. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she steps down "with a lighter step, the satchel no longer clutched quite so desperately"—and the coachman's return to vigil charges the final image. Cost is felt (her relinquishment of legal obsession), though the moment could press harder on what she's actually forfeiting.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (potter, oasis, evening, three-week journey complete). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered timelines build density through observation until the final weeks when the potter adds her own "layer of care." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (adding a timeline through tending) with conceptual cost visible in her changed understanding ("her pottery, too, would resist time…through the attention baked into every curve"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the oasis grew toward care itself"; the ending reweights prior material cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: collecting children, lights, boats, then illuminating the lighthouse. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the lit lighthouse crystallizes Mira's public emergence—but the cost is declared rather than shown ("tomorrow there would be questions, maybe consequences"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The escalation from garden tending to public spectacle is legible but lacks a pressure point that forces Mira to weigh visible trade-offs; the moves feel sequential rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens—Kael navigating the library's constraints toward stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Kael places the sundial and begins charting territory, reframing isolation as chosen coexistence. However, the cost remains largely implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; the "finally learning to breathe" reads more like thematic echo than felt consequence. The tightening is present (avoiding cartography → confronting it) but the stakes of that confrontation dissolve quickly into metaphorical resolution without a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that narrows later options.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mei Lin's decision to tie all forty-three letters to the spiral and shift from preserving secrets to releasing them constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (her identity as keeper dissolves). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—storm → installation → village recognition → teaching moment—each beat reweighting the stake of connection versus isolation. Orientation is swift (temple, post-storm, Mei Lin with letters). One mild tension: the visitors' reconciliations feel slightly convenient, but they serve thematic accumulation without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Mara, basement studio, "tonight"). Drive lens reads as Causal: her modifications → subsonic interference → tricksters retreat. Closure lands on-page with the signals stopping and factions regaining clarity, delivering a Decisive Change. Cost is present but muted—"won this round" tells us the victory is temporary, yet no specific tactical or relational price is shown in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she initiates the sequence and the air thickens, narrowing options cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, nexus structure). The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid: pressure accumulates through spatial impossibility until the organ reveals the key's location. Closure is a Decisive Change—Mara obtains the key and exits—but the cost reads thin: she "collapsed...gasping" then immediately walks out with "strangest comfort," which undercuts the promised claustrophobic toll. The nexus mechanics are taught (compass, organ vibrations reshape space) and the final image reweights the premise, yet the physical/emotional price dissolves too fast to fully charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The causal lens holds: ribbon fragment → workshop insight → killer's invisibility motive → decision to paint. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vera realizes the masks were the killer's creations. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she begins to draw a portrait of absence, crystallizing her stance with felt cost (taking on the killer's loneliness). Cost is legible but quieter than ideal—the final image charges but doesn't foreclose a concrete path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a causal lens: Mira decodes stanzas → retrieves the nail → brings it to Yoon → they discover the formula → plan to publish coded poetry. The closure is a Decisive Change (from isolation to collaborative action) with a gesture toward reversing exile, but the cost remains abstract—"perhaps some exiles could be reversed" is hopeful speculation, not a visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clean; the station, storm, and backstory anchor quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maria's final fiddle note and commitment to "bear witness" crystallizes her stance with the felt cost of assuming responsibility for the disappeared. Causality holds: glass flake → discovery → investigation → resolve to act. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the names are "pixelated amnesty." The piece teaches its lyric-laden pattern early and maintains it, though the conceptual cost remains somewhat oblique—we see her choose to sing their names but not what she must sacrifice to do so.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Luka commits to staying in the train until he can "distinguish between returning and repeating," forgoing another startup cycle. The accumulative lens holds (territorial markers reweighted from childhood control to adult commitment; foreign currency from trophies to inheritance questions). Orientation anchors quickly (circus train, Luka, twilight, his satchel). One meaningful tightening: the fox encounter crystallizes the territorial-marker metaphor and shifts his understanding from fortification to breadcrumb trail. Cost is visible: he refuses the familiar escape pattern and accepts uncomfortable questions with no clear next move.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Mira at the observatory, tracking Algol, with the telegram inciting Kove's confession. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative hybrid—Kove's revelation triggers collaborative decoding, and the dawn realization that the temple language requires multiple observers constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is conceptual: fifteen years of solitary study obscured the answer, and Chen's death underscores isolation's price. The closure reweights prior material (variable stars as chorus, shared burdens) with felt pressure, though the cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: charlatan fails → Kael investigates → vision reveals incomplete confession → seed completes it → curse breaks. Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by ~100 words). The closure—completing the frozen confession—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the druid's innocence revealed too late), meeting the Decisive Change threshold. However, the final beat feels mechanical; the seed's deployment resolves the problem it did not help create, and the "words that were never reflected" closure image, while thematically apt, carries muted emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The dominant stake—Mara's search for the intersection and the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and deepens when Chen confirms shared knowledge. However, the closure unit relies on collective epiphany and ritual completion ("We were meant to guide others") rather than a visible, felt cost that forecloses a path; the maze-building and scar-linking occur in summary, and no prior option is dramatized as lost. The lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid, but the final image declares purpose rather than crystallizing pressure with undeniable trade-off. One meaningful tightening (Chen's arrival and shared vision) narrows Mara's solitary quest into a collective one, satisfying minimal escalation, but the cost remains conceptual and off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Mira), where (catacomb orchard), and when (tonight) anchor by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens with Kael's revelation narrowing Mira's options, but the closure unit is weak—"ready to unmake what never should have been made" is poise without visible cost or a decisive change on the page. The cost of reversing the trade remains hypothetical; we don't see what Mira forfeits or what mechanics she will attempt. The backstory about Senna exceeds 30% of the text and much of it (the bridge collapse, Senna's wealth vs. Kael's poverty) does not anchor to present stimuli or alter a present micro-choice; it flattens present pressure into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection (roadie past, PBS failure, present authentication) that converges on Marcus's crisis of expertise and purpose. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marcus accepts his "confidently uncertain" position and continues the work despite lingering shame—a renunciation of certainty with visible cost (the quarry's hollow echo, his isolation). The cost is legible in the final image: "searching through remnants for whatever truth they'd consent to yield" acknowledges permanent humility. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (quarry office, present authentication scene).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered metaphors (tree, magnetic gate, clay-to-starlight) culminating in the knowledge fruit's literal emergence. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding as transformation) but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; we see no specific path foreclosed, no visible price paid for this epiphany. The because/therefore chain from analogical method to seed placement to fruit to insight holds, but the final beat summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing a choice that alters Asha's options.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear conceptual premise (tomorrow's disappearance, migrating book identities). The smelting sequence provides a meaningful tightening where contradictions fuse, and the scroll's emergence offers Conceptual Repricing—living without tomorrow by accepting flux. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words. The cost, however, remains conceptual rather than visceral: Maren's acceptance that "nothing needed to stay the same" doesn't foreclose a visible path or exact a felt price in the final image, keeping this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara refuses standard decommissioning protocol, etches her own confession, and crowns herself, forecloses the path of bureaucratic distance with visible professional cost. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern taught through shell discoveries, density increases with the journal reveal, final crowning reweights the opening inspection frame. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by ~80 words). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from cataloguing to participating. The cost is legible: her report contradicts Commission expectations and she crosses from observer to participant, risking her certification badge's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the graffiti moment intensifies her reckoning, and playing the accordion marks a meaningful deepening that reweights her stance from documentation-as-penance to embodied presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she commits to continuing her work while releasing what can't be changed, with cost legible in "raw solace" and the accordion's wheezing imperfection. One friction: the graffiti as catalyst feels slightly convenient, though it does shift tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational elements: the library manifests through tracked patterns, time loops backward, and the final image shows Elena writing a letter "three days ago." Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. Closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—the library exists "in the gap between intention and expression"—but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture, no tactic altered by a constraint. The nested letters (one sent, one to receive) frame causality, but the middle is mostly discovery-tour rather than because/therefore pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (coffee-reading frames futures, final act is motivated decision). Closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise overlay—Iris sketches the blueprint, knowing exile may follow but music will multiply—visible cost on the page ("exile, maybe, or worse"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer light). The tightening is legible: authentication demand → coffee-reading shows two futures → she chooses propagation over Empire favor, narrowing options with felt consequence. One minor seam: "Dream of anything" in Kemble's line verges on abstract stakes rather than dramatized test, but the closure decision remains grounded and causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (skyborne grotto, Kael, tonight). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual density builds through the emerald chip use, static-pattern work, and beautician preparation, culminating in the release. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the weaver "transfigured, radiant" and released carries thematic weight. Cost is conceptual (the chip spent, the spark acknowledged before oblivion) but remains abstract; no on-page decision alters Kael's options or forecloses a live path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Mei, grotto, caretaker role). The drive lens is Causal: Mei's recognition of the soul → decision to guide him to reflection → sharing the hairpin → directing him toward wisdom, with each beat motivated by her internal shift from past forgiveness to present purpose. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mei realizes contentment is "the capacity to remain present with all of it" and continues her work with reweighted understanding; the cost is confronting her daughter's killer and placing the hairpin back in her pocket rather than letting it go. One tightening deepening is sufficient for this length. Minor slip: the "sudden clarity" moment borders on convenient epiphany, though it's somewhat earned by the three-hundred-cycles buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, lighthouse, dawn, and the client relationship are in place by the second paragraph. The Drive Lens reads Situational/Causal Hybrid: Mara's pressure forces Keegan to crystallize his stance, and the closure is Earned Stasis (he accepts doubt and commits to transparency) with visible cost (writing the failure paper, abandoning certainty). The single scene tightens through the mirror confrontation and wind chime counsel, narrowing Keegan's options from seeking validation to accepting accountability. Cost is legible in his final question and Mara's instruction, though the moment lacks a sharper physical or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pond-ring demonstration recurs and deepens through trance, culminating in Maia's mirrored stone drop that reweights the presence/absence motif. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the understanding without requiring a decisive act. Orientation anchors (floating platform, magnetic grotto, tonight) land early. One pressure point tightens when Keiran corrects her question about invisibility, narrowing her frame. Cost is implied (she must release the safety of withholding) but not dramatized in a forfeited action or visible tradeoff on the page, which keeps this out of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pulse shifts from frantic loop to purposeful wandering, and the skimmer adds "one more voice to the canyon's eternal song." The cost is legible—she remains unmoving, dust settling afresh, her own navigation unchanged—but the price feels more conceptual than visceral. The Accumulative lens holds across the piece (echoes folding, bird patterns decoding memory), and the final image reweights the arrowhead's meaning. Orientation is clear early (canyon, bone towers, three hundred years), and causality is clean: arrowhead arrival → bird observation → teaching through hum → release.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) at closure: Teryn completes the keystone placement, the spire responds with lingering luminance, and the final image crystallizes her stance as a mage who "accommodates impossibilities." Cost is felt in her awareness that the Academy will come to "optimize" what she's restored, and the climb itself represents physical and social forfeiture. Orientation anchors quickly (cloudline climb, keystone, Academy context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the keystone slots into place and the light spreads, reweighting her identity and the old magic's persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (pier lamplighter, harbor, tonight). Drive lens reads Causal: Marcus's months of preparation enable the dive, the dive yields the journals, the journals' revelation shifts his stance. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "some mysteries aren't meant to be solved, only witnessed" crystallizes his stance with conceptual cost (renouncing full understanding). The cost is felt but oblique—he returns to lamps with "new reverence" rather than a decisive act that forecloses a live option, keeping this in the high 7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through coin-casting rituals and static-burst interpretation, building toward a final realization of purpose. Orientation anchors (observatory deck, post-contraction universe, Kael alone) arrive within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the backwards prophecy offers "permission to proceed without certainty," then crystallizes in the final realization of witness-translator role. However, the closure effect reads more as conceptual declaration than felt cost—there is no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page, only an understanding articulated. The Charged Poise potential is undercut by lack of undeniable pressure at the ending image; the coins "glinted" and she "gathered them tenderly" without a legible price paid or options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern-taught recurrence (echoes, monsters, naming) that reweights Mara's reaper work. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she moves from hollow namelessness to deliberate naming, carrying crystallized fears forward—a renunciation of avoidance with visible cost (the pocket of sharp crystals, the transformed work). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when naming the monsters fills the hollow place, altering her stance toward reaping.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maren, viaduct, dawn, bell). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): water returns "one drop at a time" and Maren commits to perpetual timing, her "brittle devotion hardening into something almost like faith." Cost is conceptual (endless vigilance, no migration) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell rings and reverses natural law, reweighting the cosmic balance stake. Escalation is modest—most pressure is backstory (weeks of prep), and the climactic swing succeeds on first attempt without on-page failure or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (Mara, ridgeway, post-drought). The closure—Mara's memorial proposal leading to descendants visiting—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (threats to expunge her proposal, insubordination label). Drive lens reads Causal: her choice to document and disseminate triggers the supervisor conflict and community response. One meaningful tightening occurs when the supervisor demands restricted access and Mara counters with the memorial proposal. The cost is present but mild; the "within a week" resolution compresses what could be higher-stakes resistance into summary, and the final image of restoration dilutes the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texturing. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the protagonist's realization that logic and intuition must harmonize, but the cost is abstract—she "carries nothing visible, but everything had changed" without dramatized forfeit or constraint. The orchard quest provides a continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (waterfall, orchard, sky, return). The key reversal (starlings show emergent pattern → she speaks forbidden words → green flame reveals the answer) lacks causal grounding in her prior seventeen years of work; the solution arrives through external revelation rather than protagonist agency transforming her accumulated knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost: Vera chooses transparency over escape, releasing the buckle in the final beat and committing to share her burden rather than hoard authority. The inferred lens is Causal-Situational hybrid (pressure forces stance crystallization; her methodology choice alters trust dynamics). One meaningful tightening occurs when the council's contradicting reports force immediate revision, narrowing her options to either insist or teach. Cost is legible on the page: "Some burdens were meant to be carried, not escaped." Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The radio-silence setup and council challenge drive escalation without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes clear anchors (dojo, jar, custody hearing) and delivers on-page closure when Kenji withdraws opposition and reframes the relationship as brotherly. The Resonant Reconfiguration is legible: he moves from defending his singular identity to accepting complementarity, with visible emotional cost (tears, voice shaking). However, the causal chain from Master Yoon's lesson to Kenji's courtroom epiphany compresses quickly; the "brothers" insight arrives more as realization than as a choice forged under escalating pressure. The lens reads as Causal-Hybrid, holding through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, tunnel, post-Emma's-death. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—mechanical sound layers into lullaby fragments, building toward a decisive deepening when the brother speaks and touches Emma's things. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the household's calcified silence cracks) and Marcus plans tomorrow's performance, signaling ongoing price. One micro-ambiguity: the hourglass metaphor in the opening is poetic but slightly oblique as a time anchor; it resolves contextually but costs a beat of initial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts her boundary-state role with visible physical cost (bones creaking) and the homesickness shifts rather than vanishes. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through the mist/boundary imagery and pays it off when the library reveals itself. Orientation anchors (library guardian, frozen garden, dimensional displacement) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when touching the pendant resolves the garden into the transformed library, narrowing her options to tending this impossible collection.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the catalog of failures, the crozier's transformation sequence, and the final pulsing nexus. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maren lifts the living staff and "allows herself the dangerous luxury of hope," crystallizing her interrupted destiny with felt cost (the unfilled position, the betrayal). Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The escalation reads as a single decisive reweighting rather than because/therefore linkage, appropriate for this lens, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the fragment's resonance until the "shard of hush" blooms as a conceptual repricing that reweights silence as fundamental signal. Orientation anchors clearly (Mira, tower, lunar perigee) by the opening paragraphs. The closure—her understanding that endings are transformations—lands on the page with conceptual cost (all prior transmissions were "just interference"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she tunes for valleys instead of peaks, narrowing her interpretive frame.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—radio frequencies, timeline fragments, and the grotto build pressure through pattern and density rather than strict causality. Closure lands on-page: passengers materialize, hourglass refills, ferry completes its route. The cost is conceptual (timelines collapse) and felt (three years of Marcus's devotion), but the final image doesn't fully reweight what came before—it delivers resolution rather than repricing. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in paragraph one (Marcus, Meridian Ferry, three years post-vanishing).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (who, where, what), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: thread-weaving escalates from optical tricks to subsonic vibration to manifest presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (she builds shared reality with her brother through rational enchantment), and the cost is legible—she accepts an illusion as truth. However, the brother's appearance feels sudden; the notebook phrases ("The boundary is a membrane") telegraph the turn without dramatizing the escalation, softening the causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Yael, observation dome, Thalassa Station, post-Contact). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Yael's reflection deepens through the conversation, and the chain link's meaning reweights from "connection to stability" to a bridge between human and alien navigation wisdom. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"when all horizons are unfolding"—with conceptual cost visible in her commitment to six months away and the promise to return changed. The cost is felt but oblique; the decision itself lacks on-page resistance that would make the price sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear causal chain: hearing aid pulse → message discovery → hospital records → missing girl alert → carnival location → rescue. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening). The closure delivers a Decisive Change (Elena saved) with felt cost (Mara's isolation, the weight of her work), though the coincidence of Elena being at the exact carnival weakens causal integrity. The drive lens reads as Causal with some Situational pressure, held consistently to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Maya, facility, tidal window) land by ~100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through deepening levels and rising water, building to a final image where the codex glows and Maya vows to return—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance with felt cost (repeated descent into terror). However, the cost remains abstract: we see her emerge and resolve to return, but no on-page forfeiture or tactical price paid in this specific descent. The closure reweights "between the tides, between states" but the conceptual cost is more asserted than demonstrated in a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (Marcus in the observatory, three hours waiting, midnight). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: heartbeat counting → ink ritual → grandmother's pattern → stopping the count. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he stops counting, accepts "beautiful brokenness"), and the cost is legible—he relinquishes the anchor that kept him tethered post-trauma. However, the escalation is thin; most of the middle is reflection and description rather than a meaningful tightening of options. The ink-spilling beat arrives late and resolves quickly without prior friction or a narrowing choice that would deepen the stakes under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through repeated encoding beats (bone pillar, multiple surfaces, final press) and shifts cadence at closure when she smiles, knowing the language will persist in encoded form. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): she accepts that no one may decode her work, yet the language survives transformed—cost is visible (sleep, sanity, solitude) and the final image reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors early (tower, canyon, forty-three years). One tightening occurs when the diamond hums and returns a harmonic, narrowing her method.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elena), where (underground garden), and when (three weeks post-return) within the opening paragraph. Causality holds: Elena descends, learns about the phone, hears Tom's confession, receives her mother's message, and decides to pursue metamorphosis. The closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (renouncing her documentation mission, pocketing the antenna to learn transformation), and the final image ("snow began falling upward") reweights prior gravitational play. Cost is legible but felt more conceptually than viscerally; the shift from observer to participant is clean but the stakes of that shift remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece establishes orchard-as-prison early, accumulates density through the music/roots/statue sequence, and lands a Decisive Change (trees uproot and follow) with visible cost (statues crumble, orchard leaves its enclosure). Orientation anchors quickly (sky-bridge violinist, mechanical city, evening discovery). The escalation from discovery to playing to full liberation reads cleanly under the lens, and the cost—shattering the statues, seeding new ground—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Kael, cobalt arcade, twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the density of border-crossing details (drones, defunct fountain, uniform friction) builds to the final image of "seventeen more deliveries before dawn" that reweights the opening stake with undeniable cost. Closure is Earned Stasis—Kael continues his work knowing the price—and the cost is legible on the page in "the brittle hush settled around him like a blessing." One micro turn when Mira receives the bottle; the final paragraph recharges prior images (drones vanished, shops shuttered) to deepen the portrait of sustained defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the carpenter leaves the carousel turning and returns to singing, a meaningful shift from seven years of silence with conceptual cost (foreclosing the purely mute stance). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered motifs (wind bells, halo fragment, singing) that converge at the ending to reweight silence as possibility. Orientation is swift (carousel carpenter, October, circus train). One meaningful tightening occurs when the wrong turn yields the hidden clearing and the halo fragment prompts song. Slight deduction: the causal trigger for breaking silence feels more atmospheric than choice-driven; the mechanism relies on the space's mystique rather than protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates texture through the mapping project and arrives at a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph ("Stories live in the curvature"). However, the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no felt price paid on the page. The "voids" discovery and final notation feel like observations rather than decisive changes that reweight options. Orientation is clear early (3 AM, library, Meridian's project), so no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina discovers the scratched message and reweights her entire search—not Iris returned, but "Iris understood, translated from absence into a language made entirely of light." The cost is conceptual and felt: she must continue the vigil alone, frame by frame. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the sunrise ritual deepens from mechanical to revelatory. Orientation anchors early (librarian, archipelago, dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the palette message rewrites six months of grief into a communication system.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Mara seeks the locksmith → device reveals fear's architecture → understanding floods → she exits with the symphony unlocked. Orientation anchors (shadowed nexus, locksmith's shop, Mara + handkerchief) land within the first ~80 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "some locks exist only because we forget we've always held the key" reweights the premise with visible cost (tears, the aching longing remains). The causality holds, though the device's mechanics ("sounds emerged—not melodies, but the architecture of feeling") remain somewhat abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Mara, greenhouse, present night). The piece follows an accumulative lens: sensory details and memory fragments build density until the palm-to-mushroom触 triggers the flood of backstory, which then reconfigures her life's work into a legible pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces mystery), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—her decades of ignorance are reframed as necessary maturation rather than a felt loss that alters her present stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: tea-leaf sessions and recursive backward-walking accumulate density until Kael mirrors Miren's nervous retreat, reweighting her readiness to return. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael steps into dusk carrying shadow-glass and resilience, options crystallized with the cost of "becoming strange enough to go home" legible in that final image. One minor gap: the mechanics of "reversible exile" remain abstract, but the ending reweights prior particulars cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains single POV across one continuous scene. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seed now carries preserved essence, and Esme's smile signals ongoing work across realms—a crystallization of her role as cross-world gardener. However, the cost remains conceptual and gestural; the aching knees and cramped hands are mentioned but do not visibly foreclose an option or alter her stance. The accumulative lens (patient weaving of essences through mist-revealed gardens) holds without contradiction, but the final image reweights wonder's preservation more thematically than tactically. One meaningful deepening occurs (the multi-hour weaving), sufficient for this length, though the stakes never truly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (who/where/what). The story accumulates pressure through the boy's secret, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara adds a new, heavier silence to her collection and reaches for the next knot—an earned refusal of escape with visible cost ("emptier, heavier"). The cascade of unraveling is irreversible once triggered, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final image: she continues despite accruing weight. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elena's methodical examination builds density through parallel footage, grass patterns, and geological surveys, culminating in her recommendation and dawn realization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final paragraph reweights the henge as "a monument to the unmappable" and maps as documents of faith—but the cost remains abstract and conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful deepening occurs when she notices the identical listening gesture and spiral grass pattern, but the recommendation itself lacks on-page resistance or a visible trade-off that would make the before/after more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (submersible, Persephone, Marina) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the discovery sequence deepens through layered artifacts (spine → library → cylinders → communications chamber → snow globe → radio log) that reweight the grandmother's quest. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina's decision to "note each thread" and accept transformation rather than solve constitutes a stance crystallization with conceptual cost—she abandons two years of lobbying's implicit goal. The because/therefore chain from grandmother's transmission → Marsh's response → Marina's realization holds clearly. Minor: the "physics of letting go" arrives pre-interpreted by Marsh, reducing Marina's discovery work slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through discovery, connection, and the encoding act, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the balladeer and ghost "articulate what had been too long silent" with the storm carrying messages down. Orientation is anchored early (misty courtyard, Sky Monastery, three weeks ago). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the ghost wants to encode unspoken prayers, narrowing her goal to the graffiti circuit. Cost is felt—she commits her art to a new medium and bonds irreversibly with the ghost—though the exact sacrifice (what path is foreclosed) remains oblique. The closure reconfigures her isolation into communion, satisfying RR under the Accumulative lens, but the final image ("The storm sang with them") leans declarative rather than charging prior particulars with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 (Maren, elevator, icebound spire). The diary unfolds across the climb, accumulating entries that shift from joy to sickness, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren holds "proof that someone had noticed her," reweighting her grief into something "more permanent than sorrow." Cost is conceptual and felt—she carries fragments of a hollowed captain—and the final image of clouds "like patient ghosts" reconfigures the opening's frozen ascent. One meaningful deepening through the goggles' revelation tightens the dominant stake (seeking joy beneath anguish). No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: gondola at altitude, meteorologist, three months post-accident. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through Victor's ghost-touch fingerprints, the sky-sadness system, storm-memory observations, converging in the final notation "homecoming" that reweights the archive as memorial. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara closes her notebook "satisfied," her endurance of grief and solitary research forecloses the path of abandoning Victor's work, with cost visible in supervisor's suggestion of grief leave and colleagues' clinical watching. The cost could be sharper—her satisfaction dilutes the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (artist, tree library, 4 AM summons) and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coin's "sacred, doomed attempt" reweights her entire practice, making her blindness-through-measurement a meditation on noble futility rather than a handicap. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—layered reflections on limits and infinity cohere into a final philosophical stance. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the coin and its impossible detail, shifting her understanding of her own work. The cost is conceptual and felt (she accepts perpetual approximation), though not a decisive external change. Causality is loose but consistent with the contemplative design.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The piece establishes clear because/therefore linkage from observation to phrasebook decoding to reversal action, which triggers the ship's release. Orientation anchors early (stranded airship, three days, observation deck). Closure is a Decisive Change with visible physical consequence (ship shudders, luminance dissipates, descent begins) and the cost is legible in Maren's shift from isolated theorist to active cartographer. One meaningful tightening occurs when she connects the symbols to the hopscotch pattern and acts on the insight, narrowing options to a single test.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (ice, mirrors, gears, starlight) toward a final reweighting of the protagonist's gift. However, the closure effect—"the rhythm of repair, ancient and new"—relies on conceptual assertion rather than a visible, felt cost that forecloses a path. The liquid starlight and materialized gears function as deus ex machina, granting understanding without dramatized struggle or tradeoff. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence, but the cost at closure remains oblique, stated in metaphor rather than made legible through on-page action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who (Mirela), where (orchard planet), and when (after settlement) within the opening paragraph, meeting the Orientation Test. The causal chain is legible: fracturing community → chalk messages → Kess opens storehouse → collective action → merchant offer → vote → Mirela's rest. However, the merchant-ship reversal arrives abruptly without prior foreshadowing, weakening earned escalation. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mirela's release from her task), but the cost—her ceasing to exist as an active presence—is stated rather than felt in a charged final image. The drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture (chalk messages building), held through closure, though the merchant pivot feels convenient rather than motivated by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara climbs, places the puppet head, hums the lullaby, and the nested patterns absorb it—pressure accumulates through density and ritual cadence. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: she becomes part of the pattern she made, the lullaby outlasts existence, and the cost (self-dissolution) is legible in "let herself become part of the pattern." Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, Mara, puppet head) arrive within the first paragraph. One minor seam: "the distance between silence and forgetting" and similar high-register abstractions risk lens drift toward essay, but the ritual structure holds and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of caretaker role) with felt cost—Maren returns to the labyrinth understanding she cannot leave. Causal lens holds: nut discovery → blueprint knowledge → successful rescue → acceptance. Orientation is clean (cliffside orchard, Maren, present continuous). One meaningful tightening occurs when the blueprint reveals hidden paths, narrowing her tactical options while raising the stakes for the hikers' survival.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Maya, ravine, present-tense descent) land within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Maya moves from avoidance to continuation of the shared work, forecloses the path of abandonment, and the cost is legible in her decision to finish what Daniel started. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—foam patterns, chrysalis, and symphonic metaphor accumulate density and cadence until the final image reweights the dominant stake (grief as barrier vs. grief as connection). One meaningful deepening occurs when the foam patterns translate into the polymer insight, narrowing her options from paralysis to purpose. The closure lands on the page with felt cost (ending the avoidance, accepting transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight pools, grooves accumulate into pattern, the final bottling reconfigures the opening emptiness into "trace elements of others' absences." Orientation anchors (floating library, opening day, Mira alone) land early. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—stories begin "not with words but with silence"—and the bottled moonlight carries conceptual cost (homeopathic collective forgetting enables individual healing). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragments reveal "mother" seventeen times and "home" carved deeply, reweighting Mira's catalog from measurement into emotional archaeology. The lens holds and closure lands, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: who (Chef Maren), where (desert fortress breach), and the impossible pavilion below. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of sensory memory-tasting, then shifts cadence at dawn when the ice weeps and the structure releases. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the pavilion collapses, its unspoken dream heard) with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One causality hiccup: the mechanics of how her processing triggers physical decomposition remain asserted rather than earned, but the before/after is clear and the cost (centuries of grief transformed, then released) charges the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (who, where, when by ~100 words). The drive lens reads Causal: Mira installs equipment → initiates broadcast → prompts inter-silo dialogue → spontaneous harmony emerges. Yet the closure lacks felt cost—Elevator Seven's participation and the resulting chorus feel inevitable rather than earned through on-page friction. The weight descends as a timer metaphor but never threatens to run out or constrain tactics. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the trajectory is linear wish-fulfillment without a reversal that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Maya, moonlit canyon, "tonight") land early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layered exposition builds toward a conceptual repricing where Maya redefines the project's purpose. However, the closure unit—her decision to "return these dreams"—occurs off-page as future intention rather than on-page action or renunciation with visible cost. The cost remains abstract ("began, finally, to make it whole") without a concrete forfeiture or stakes-altering choice dramatized in the final beat, weakening closure legibility under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (archivist, archive vault, then grotto). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the serpentine path, threshold effects, and inversion-hour mechanics layer to reweight the central question of preservation. Closure occurs on-page (planting the seeds in the hidden chamber) with felt cost: she leaves but the vigilance will remain, a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses her personal guardianship. One meaningful deepening—the discovery of the masters' prior planting—shifts her act from founding to renewal, charging the final image. The cost is legible but understated; we feel the passage of knowledge more than personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, grove, post-Silence dawn. The piece follows an Accumulative lens—density builds from wire-positioning to strumming to grove-wide resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where the final image reweights the premise: music persists as motion beneath sound. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers) and conceptual (acceptance that sound is gone but vibration endures). One meaningful deepening occurs when the symphony manifests through the grove's response, shifting Mara's stance from sculptor to witness of a transformed art form.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is on-page: Katrin establishes the covenant through chess translation, the beings refine it into a living balance, and the nexus steadies—a Decisive Change with felt cost (she must now teach and maintain this fragile system). The drive lens is Causal: her theory → board setup → beings respond → new position → covenant accepted. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, why). One meaningful tightening: the beings' geometric compression/expansion responses narrow her hypothesis into a workable method. Cost is legible in "constant thoughtful precision to maintain" and her commitment to teach others.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Charged Poise: the clasp opens and Marcella gains access, reweighting her understanding of Elena's silence). Cost is present but muted—Marcella sheds tears and gains insight, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page. The causal chain from frequency-tuning to clasp-opening relies on metaphorical logic ("the frequency of love itself") that borders on convenient, but the piece teaches its pattern early and the ending reconfigures prior silences with undeniable thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear orientation (treetop village, herbalist, olfactory sensitivity) and follows a causal arc: seed arrival → planting → bloom → transformation. However, the closure unit—"completely still inside"—lands as an asserted internal shift without a decisive on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a prior path with felt cost. The three-year compression and three-day bloom are summarized ("she remained," "she stayed present"), obscuring the moment-by-moment pressure that would earn the Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation test penalty is waived; mild lens ambiguity (accumulative/causal hybrid) does not fully obscure the ending but the cost remains told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal chain (Turning → echo chamber → grandmother's message → First Orchard → canister discovery) under a Causal lens. Closure arrives on-page as a Decisive Change: Kael moves from ignorance to proof and shifts from pollination work to council confrontation. However, the final cost remains implied rather than dramatized—we're told she's "armed with proof" but don't see the confrontation or any immediate price for the discovery. The grandmother's echo functions as a convenient information drop that solves the mystery without Kael having to piece it together through error or sacrifice, weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara moves from structural investigator to someone who "really heard" the warning, understanding the residents' collective foresight. The causal lens holds cleanly through discovery → comprehension → documentation with cost implied (the labyrinth remains dangerous, residents evacuated). Orientation is prompt (Porto Velho, container labyrinth, post-silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the collapse was atmospheric, not structural, reweighting her mission and the residents' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Kael must perform the ritual at the precise moment of the sculptor's chisel strike. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Conceptual Repricing): the "unfettering" releases wonder into the world's consciousness, and the final image of silent bells "painting nothing but possibility" reweights the premise with felt conceptual cost (the ritual exhausts its singular moment and Kael rests, the work complete). The cost is implied rather than viscerally dramatized—no forfeited relationship, no injury, no immediate personal price—but the finality of "certify...at last" and the shift from preparation to rest signal a before/after that coheres under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Mira, Thunder-echo range, post-guardianship. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—canyon acoustics, driftwood markers, and the flute's fading dual-nature build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts the threshold's irreversibility and commits to documentation with visible cost in her renunciation of restoration). The closure image—touching the canyon wall, feeling silence pool—reweights her week of investigation with conceptual cost (she will guide others to witness endings, not fix them). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shimmer reveals the world intact but unreachable, shifting her from self-accusation to acceptance of entropy's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal beats. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, vanishing stars). The piece escalates through because/therefore linkage: halo fragment → printed page → Mira feels transposed empathy → he sets type "with his own uncertain hands." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes his shift from borrowed to owned agency under time pressure, and the cost—"before there's nothing left to feel about"—is undeniable. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each encounter (farmer, herbalist) densifies the premise that couriers plant wonder, and the final image reweights Kessa's trembling as "fertile ground." Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Kessa accepts her role with steadier hands—but the cost is more conceptual (accepting routine as purpose) than viscerally felt on the page, which keeps it just below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (arbor, prism, frost) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts her mentor's hidden work. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure effect is a stance crystallization ("she would continue her mentor's real work"), which qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page action or renunciation makes the price legible in the final beat. The mist "embracing her like an answer" gestures at resonance but does not reweight prior material with a sharp, visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (puzzle edges, amber bead, raveling silence) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the mother's death becomes the message's completion, an Earned Stasis with visible cost ("hands finally stilled," bead dimmed). Closure lands on the page with felt sacrifice. Orientation anchors appear late (orchard/bamboo/loom established only after the opening abstract passage), but the disorientation proves functional at closure when the spatial setting becomes the mother's final resting place, so the penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael's months of preparation converge in the ritual striking that reverses the planet's death. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (memory erasure) and the bud image reweights the premise. The escalation reads as a single sustained intensification rather than multiple turns, which fits the lens. Minor orientation delay in the opening (who/where/when fully clear only after ~150 words) does not obscure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative layering (sensory mapping through universes tightens until the nested pocket is discovered). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the first paragraph. The closure—Kaia's decision to learn multi-world weaving—is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she accepts her mother's exile and the weight of infinite navigation. One meaningful tightening: the shard heats and pulls her through accelerating transitions to the reveal. Cost is legible in "a stone she could choose to carry" and the final commitment "teach me." The nested-universe discovery and reunion feel slightly convenient (the shard guides her exactly when needed), nudging this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: letters and stones layer into a communion arc that reweights loneliness and guardianship. Orientation anchors quickly (Vera, lantern room, 3:47 AM lamp failure). The closure—Vera's vow to continue and the felt embrace—registers as Charged Poise: she crystallizes her role with undeniable emotional cost ("ached in her chest, radiant and painful"). One friction: the ghost's final letter arrives conveniently at the exact moment the lamp dies, a coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under situational tolerance but borderline for causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph (pass orientation test). Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "ancient light shaping everything new" reweights the premise, but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift tied to Mara's prophetic utterances or the wick's function. The storm sequence provides a continuous thread but no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; ships "alter course in perfect synchronization" without Mara's agency driving that change. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (dye master, tea house, dawn, post-surgery timeframe). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers observations and confessions to deepen the protagonist's understanding of her inherited magnetism, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts the work of witnessing. The proprietor's revelation at midpoint provides the crucial reweighting, and the final image—wing blazing on the windowsill—charges prior material with purposeful resonance. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the gift rather than burden, and the cost is implicit in her commitment to return and bear stories. Causality is clean, though the coincidence of the proprietor knowing the donor and giving her the same wing strains credibility slightly without undermining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative lens early (pin → corridors → astronomer's notes → sextant reconstruction → moonlight reveal) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Kael's understanding shifts from quantified sorrow to "the full scope of human continuation." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The final image ("carrying moonlight in her bones") reweights prior material with felt cost—her night's labor and new knowledge—though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatically visible as a forfeited option or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of fragment-gathering that builds toward the dawn restoration, and closure arrives on-page as Elara dissolves into light—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (bound release enacted). Orientation anchors appear early (mirror world, greenhouse, scattered consciousness). However, the cost feels thematic rather than felt: Elara's dissolution is framed as fulfillment, not sacrifice, weakening the "visible cost" requirement. The causal chain from humming to dawn-threads to blooming trees to spreading light is more associative than because/therefore, fitting the lens but reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The invitation-to-library-to-acceptance sequence reads as exploratory wandering rather than tightening pressure; Eleanor encounters no meaningful obstacle or cost until the hiding moment, which resolves immediately. Closure arrives when she "nodded her acceptance," but the stakes of joining versus staying alone are never tested on the page—she simply agrees. The "home in the paradox" line gestures at cost but doesn't foreclose a live option with felt consequence. Orientation is clean early, preventing the Q2 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly, building density through layered images (moss, vines, bread, seeds) that converge at closure. The tea-house discovery and old woman's appearance constitute a meaningful tightening that reweights Mira's project from beautification to archaeology. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of seeds and memory recharges prior material with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual—Mira accepts the insufficiency ("not everything, perhaps not enough") and commits anyway—legible in "The ordinary against oblivion."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Celeste releases the capsule and accepts the library's fall with visible cost—her own death. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through measured frequencies, reweaving patterns, and the final image of descent. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). One meaningful deepening occurs when Celeste realizes preservation requires transformation. The cost is undeniable on the page: "standing quiet among the shelves, having already sent the most important record ahead."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: false leads trace cleanly to the north-caves revelation, and Della's final choice forecloses her vengeance path with legible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she refuses to use the recording, accepting that mercy trumps justice, and the cost is felt in her climb back "toward the dying stars." One beat could tighten: the transition from confrontation to decision feels slightly compressed given the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through taste-cataloging, the convergence itself, and the compass ring's reweighting until the final renunciation crystallizes a conceptual repricing—skepticism transforms into acceptance, the ring shifts from navigation tool to archived memory. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (she removes her grandmother's link to the old world). One friction: the forests' elections and their "patient deliberations" are invoked but never pressure Kaia's choice; they remain scenic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements (symbolic cave/crystals). Orientation anchors cleanly (Maya, cave, post-museum). Closure lands on-page: Maya's decision to climb back up is a Decisive Change with visible cost—she must face the gallery opening she's avoided, carrying her brother's portrait and letter into public view. The docent's appearance and revelation of the stolen painting create genuine pressure that narrows Maya's options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the broken lock reveals someone has found her secret, escalating to the docent's confrontation and gallery offer.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal chain: fragment found → map assembled → Archive discovered → decision to return and share. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira and Kade etch new truths onto plates, Mira's leaves unfurl fully, and she resolves to tell others—a crystallization of stance with felt cost (the ongoing toxic sky, the fragility of one honest conversation at a time). The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements (the gathering of fragments, the layering of honest moments). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kade's candor strengthens Mira, escalating her resolve to pursue the map. Cost is legible: the decision to expose vulnerability in a city built on necessary lies.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ice melts, bells respond, the sculpture shifts. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights wonder and impermanence—but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page. Orientation anchors who and where early; the single continuous scene fits scope. The ending reconfigures meaning through the marriage of motion and music, yet "faces transformed" and "the color of wonder preserved" are told outcomes without visible friction or forfeiture that the reader can point to.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Unit-47 achieves functional fragmentation, "navigating by an internal compass that finally knew how to point toward something that felt like home, even when north refused to stay still." The cost is visible—the roses burned, the box destroyed, the android now "fragmented but functional"—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, deepening through the controlled burn ritual. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (android, dome, farm, post-child departure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic shift forces the containment strategy. The ending reconfigures the opening's longing into purposeful growth from ash.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—Maya follows threads of neighborhood storytelling that build a portrait of Iris, culminating in their meeting and Iris's reintegration into the courtyard rhythm. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Iris "didn't look like she was running" signals a stance shift, and the cost is implied in the months of sealed grief now opened. However, the turn from "raw, exhausted sobbing" to hearing others "the way plants hear rain" happens almost entirely off-page between paragraphs; the key reversal—Iris's willingness to stay and listen—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible friction. Orientation is clear early. One modest tightening occurs when Maya offers the locket, but the escalation feels more like gentle accumulation than pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative lens: Mira layers encoded journal entries and dance movements across years, building toward escape. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (sunken lab, spiral staircase, captivity). The closure—doors opening after the final dance—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, and the cost (leaving journals, three years encoded) is legible. However, the escape mechanism (motion-responsive locks) arrives late without prior dramatization, weakening causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale → pockets → crystal chamber → coffee grounds → recovery sequence builds density and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The final image—"Each one proved that nothing was ever truly gone"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the work is "slow, silent, and gleaming"), though the felt price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening (from touching pockets to stabilizing and reading them) is present, satisfying the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (gathering embers). Orientation anchors arrive early enough. The closure—crumbling wing, erased journal, world saved—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only (ignorance as salvation) without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for the protagonist herself. The prophecy's spread and reversal follow because/therefore logic, but the summoner's seventeen-year solitude and her grandmother's teachings feel like convenient setup rather than pressure that tightens choice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the rooftop revelation crystallizes the narrator's stance, and the final image of teaching ancient alphabets under meteors reweights the Thursday-tea pattern. Closure participation is clean. Causality holds across the flashback structure (sugar → tea → lessons → rooftop confrontation). One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator pushes past the "agreed upon lies" boundary. Cost is somewhat implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—no depicted sacrifice or foreclosed option at the ending beat itself, though the transformation is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors early (velvet garden, Archive tower, Mara's seashell) and follows accumulative/textural logic: resonance structures build through demonstration until the flowers respond. The closure delivers a conceptual repricing—memories as living architectures rather than specimens—with thematic cost (isolation reframed as foundation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell sings and the flower pulses in harmony, reweighting prior material. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt, and Chen's immediate buy-in deflates some earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (stalactites, aurora, pearl twilight) toward a final reweighting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Lien completes the work, embedding the thorn in marble as testament. Cost is visible: she commits treason and leaves the sanctuary with "quiet certainty." Orientation anchors early (marble sanctuary, aurora, Lien). One meaningful deepening occurs when she begins the forgery and channels intent. Weakness: the weeks-long reconsideration is summarized, flattening what could be the story's pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with the repeating "echo" motif, but causality remains loose—Kael's voice splits "for the first time" without prior setup explaining why now. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she joins the guardians), yet the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no prior path is visibly foreclosed. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty. The "progressive disclosure" method is named but not dramatized as a tactical constraint that shapes her investigative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates dream fragments toward a conceptual repricing—Maya understands the captain's sacrifice and promises to expose it. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (Maya, glacier shrine, night, wreck-diver). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (promise to contact archives), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action shows what Maya risks or forfeits by making this promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she names the captain's choice, yet the final beat resolves too smoothly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is prompt (philosopher on parapet, rain, fireflies, night). The piece accumulates observations and reflections that orbit the concept of hidden patterns, building toward tomorrow's teaching moment. Closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Chen returns to net-mending "ready to make strong what had been broken"—but the cost is not legible on the page; no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no visible price paid in the final image. The story teaches its pattern of patient observation and promises future action rather than delivering a present tightening or deepening that changes what Chen can or will do.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Maya burns the evidence, foreclosing her truth-excavation mission to preserve survivors' hope. The causal lens holds—document reconstruction → revelation → moral calculus → choice—with one meaningful tightening when the stillpoint mechanics emerge. Orientation anchors (Maya, orchard gate, post-liquidation wasteland) appear within the first three paragraphs. The fifteen-year backstory and "sharply observant gaze" paragraph delay momentum slightly, but the core because/therefore chain from shredded papers to final renunciation remains unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the radio messages accrete, factions form, and the final transmission reweights Vera's role. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"You have always been both the question and the answer" crystallizes her stance with felt pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: she switches off the transmitter knowing her work is "just beginning," accepting isolation as necessary. The piece coheres under the lens and the ending image holds, though the price could be more viscerally anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dawn ritual → music box discovery → composite layering → decision to share. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Maren's walk toward town with "pennies and purpose" reweights her vagrant existence as deliberate cultural work, with the cost implied in "never quite clean, never quite warm enough." One meaningful deepening through the composite-sound revelation suffices at this length. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece opens with clear who/where/when and follows a causal arc: Maren detects discord, confronts Kael, rejects his destructive release, and engineers a harmonic solution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ice becomes memorial rather than tomb, Kael crystallizes into the chorus), and the cost is legible—Kael's agency ends, the station's future is tied to Maren's resonance chambers. However, the final turn depends on Maren's off-page expertise (harmonic engineering) introduced at the peak beat, and the piece does not prepare the reader for why humming would succeed where Kael's vibrational approach failed, creating a slight causality softness at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Kael, basalt sanctuary, post-freeze). The piece follows a causal lens: because Kael mapped for seventeen winters and discovered the magnetic window, she can time the escape; because the viaduct hums after rain, the Directorate's scanners falter. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the group reaches the first waypoint, the prison recedes, and Kael marks the next course with visible cost (days of vigilance ahead, sustained restraint required). The cost is felt in "how long until they realize?" and her reply that frames ongoing tension. One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic window opens and they move, narrowing options from wait to act.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements (lantern motif). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. The closure lands on-page (she emerges with evidence, ready to act), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: "some investigations were worth the cost of liberation" tells us there's a price without showing forfeiture, consequence, or tactical constraint. The water-level discovery that proves pre-drowning placement provides one meaningful tightening, satisfying minimal escalation. The lens holds, but the RR lacks visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The inciting move—Marcus brings the heart to Mrs. Chen—links clearly to his goal (restore it, deliver to Sarah). The escalation is primarily a decision to act after years of stasis, but the decisive change occurs off-page ("knowing he'd return in three days, knowing he'd finally deliver"). The on-page closure is a mood shift and a commitment, not a dramatized act with visible cost; the story ends in transit toward the real turn. Backstory about Thomas and Sarah is exposition-heavy but causally motivated. One meaningful tightening (Marcus sees Sarah volunteering, triggering the repair decision) narrows options, but the final beat is setup, not closure under causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (workshop, acid sea, Fennec at kaleidoscope). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images of the kaleidoscope, acid sea, and yearning algorithms. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Fennec begins watching patterns and ends watching patterns with no on-page reversal or reconfiguration. The closure image (smile, transliterate, acid sea carries onward) offers atmosphere but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The "bell she rang" metaphor remains abstract without legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (corporate memory keeper, EternaNet archive, present investigation). The piece follows a causal lens: Mira notices patterns → tracks deletion logs → discovers the preserved consciousness backups → decides to extract them. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the astronauts are trapped in purgatory rather than deleted. Closure lands on-page with her decision to write the extraction protocol, though the felt cost remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized—we see determination but not the immediate price of defying her employer.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory expansion (shadow unfurling, mirror visions, fragment passing) and crystallizes in the leaders' shared smile and request. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders' "Tell us how" and Kael's reply reweight the feud into collaborative possibility, with visible cost (decades of pride foreclosed, vulnerability exposed). One deduction: the cost could be more sharply specified in a concrete image or forfeiture in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Vera suspends between cancellation and commitment, the fold in patience crystallized in the final image with felt cost (appointment still waiting, but urgency dissolved). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rescue scene reweights her stance from "useful before the end" to discovery that "letting go and holding on were sometimes the same gesture." Cost is legible in the laptop scene and her decision to defer without canceling.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The lens reads Causal-Hybrid: Marco's persuasion via grafting metaphor motivates Elena's shift from declared practicality to staying, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is implied—she misses the bus, risks family feud—but the final image ("we have all night to tend this particular graft") lacks visible forfeiture or a line showing what she just gave up. The closure lands but remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, preventing higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Maya in the pavilion, third morning, prophet arrives. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through ritual description and dialogue toward the consecration act. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maya commits to weaving herself into the parapet, forecloses her full autonomous life with felt cost. The tightening is legible but gentle; the cost statement ("part of me will remain") is told more than shown in the final image. One meaningful deepening present.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through the arrangement of photographs and the gathering of townspeople, culminating in a group decision to memorialize the site. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the arrangement catalyzes shared planning and a commitment to transform the space), but the cost is vague: Mira packs her case and moves on with no visible sacrifice, and the townspeople's shift from silence to collective action happens off-page in summary ("they began talking"). The tightening—photos arranged, people arrive, decisions coalesce—relies on telling more than showing at the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (library, dawn, Maren, crystal). The piece accumulates density through the crystal's recordings and builds to tomorrow's testimony as Charged Poise—options are crystallized, stakes are legible. Deduction: the closure remains in preparation mode; the testimony itself and its cost are deferred off-page, weakening the on-page felt consequence. The pattern of growth is thematically rich but the final image doesn't decisively reconfigure Maren's situation with visible price paid now.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors early (Marcus in fog sculpture garden with chalk). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (fog, rust, memory dissolution) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Sarah's single chalk line reweights the premise—capturing versus witnessing. The closure lands with felt cost (killing the sound by capturing it) and conceptual repricing (prophecy as shared remembering). One meaningful deepening occurs when they reach the arch and Marcus hears the frequency, then chooses not to capture it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights escape velocity from speed to acceptance, with the cost embodied in the mountain shaking and the clock's wild hand measuring what cannot be held. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—sensory density and recurring images (spinning hand, tremors, Moon's constancy) build pressure that crystallizes in the ending realization. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (observatory, workbench, Mira's loupe). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira restructures the mechanism to measure instability rather than time, narrowing options and changing what the observatory can capture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal arc: blood work confirmation → Richard's request → Maya's method (recordings + calls) → Linda's arrival → reconciliation, with the closure moment (hand-holding, "I'm sorry"/"I'm here," vinyl reweighted) landing on the page with felt cost (Richard dies three weeks later having achieved his goal). However, the central reconciliation beat is told rather than shown ("They talked until sunset"), which weakens the decisive change at the climactic moment. The cost is legible (Richard's death, the years lost), but the pivot scene itself lacks dramatized pressure, creating a gap between setup and payoff that prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (observatory, Mira, post-spoon-bending reality) land cleanly in the opening. The key unlocks the hidden chamber, revealing the sleepers and reframing Mira's identity—a solid causal reversal that narrows options to merge or remain incomplete. Closure is Charged Poise: Mira traces the "return" rune and waits for noon, crystallizing the stakes with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (foregoing independent existence) though the final act stops just short of consummation. The spoon-bending premise and loop-closure mechanics are seeded early and paid off, but the shadow-original reveal could tighten further if Mira's prior unease were more concretely foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Dr. Cole, village clinic, thirty years, then the substitute body and secret garden. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Maren's understanding deepens through the constellation work (accumulative pattern), which then enables the tactical solution (causal). Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Thomas steps through, another child returns, and Maren carries "her new certainty like a healing she'd learned to perform on reality itself." The constellation-building sequence provides clear because/therefore links: touching bones → comprehension blooms → map of return emerges. One minor seam: the transition from finding the substitute body to Mrs. Weir bringing Maren to the garden compresses motivation slightly, but the present-tense work earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's patient polishing reframes trauma as shared light, and the final placement crystallizes her ongoing choice with visible cost (solitary vigilance, tending rather than moving on). The accumulative lens holds cleanly—each polishing session deepens the practice. Orientation anchors early (cliffs, grotto, telescope). One minor causality question: how strangers find this hidden grotto is elided, though the notes suggest discovery has occurred.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through pattern (icicle drip, moss, amber preservation) and the closure—the executive's shifted bearing and Mira's return to tending—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is visible: the executive leaves without absolution, only "the beginning of a path toward it," and Mira continues her impossible work. Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira in data center, three weeks post-confession). The escalation is a single deepening through the pendant exchange rather than multiple reversals, which fits the length and textural mode. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's hands steady after holding the amber.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece coheres around gathering fragments of hope, taught early through the novel-within-story structure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the novelist stands at the nexus, recognizes the sister's presence through accumulated moments, and begins writing with felt cost (letting go of literal reunion). The stranger's arrival provides the final tightening that crystallizes the protagonist's stance. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of ritual detail builds toward the vine-glow payoff and the final "land remembered" image. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the land's breach is remedied), with conceptual cost legible in "not fully restored; that would take seasons, years, generations." However, the cost is told rather than felt in a concrete micro-choice or forfeiture that alters Maera's options, weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a ritual pattern early and follows it through to the burning of the flash paper, which serves as a Conceptual Repricing—the map's vanishing reweights the premise (preservation vs. release). Orientation is clean within 120 words. However, the cost remains implied rather than legibly felt: we are told she "memorized every line" and will follow tomorrow, but no visible price is paid on the page at the moment of burning. The closure unit reconfigures meaning but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure or felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (locksmith, cavern, autumn-to-spring) and follows an accumulative lens: mounting discoveries layer toward the final decision to seal and preserve in private. The closure reads as Earned Stasis—she chooses solitude and silence over fame—but the cost is asserted ("she didn't publish") rather than dramatized with a moment of renunciation that forecloses an on-page option. The causal chain is legible but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it summarizes her stance rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients who/where/when by ~120 words and accumulates density through layered images (calcified weight, coral patterns, fractal threads). However, the closure unit—"understanding that some traps were also sanctuaries"—is a thematic realization delivered via summary rather than a decisive image or reconfiguration that reweights prior material with on-page cost. The weaver's stance does not crystallize through action or refusal; she extinguishes the lamp and sits, then plans to continue tomorrow. Cost is conceptual but not legible in the final beat; no tactic or option visibly forecloses. Oriented properly but closure lacks the decisive pressure or felt cost required for higher bands under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is swift (workshop, skylight, October rain by line two). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through the carving ritual, Viktor's particulars, and the final image's reconfiguration of "here and gone and here again." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira's continued carving practice forecloses raw paralysis with visible cost (the cooling tea, the patient rain, the gallery of gestures). One meaningful deepening occurs when she commits the first cut and the form emerges, reweighting her relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds. The piece opens with disorientation ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") that's pattern-taught and charges the temporal confusion; by closure the camera wheel's clicks provide concrete temporal progression that reweights the opening's drift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + nascent agency): Kera acknowledges loss, pockets the wheel, extends her hand toward modest achievable work. Cost is legible in "Small gardens, perhaps. Modest platforms" after the grand floating-garden ambition is explicitly named and mourned. One tightening deepening occurs when the ghost's invitation replaces accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maya's realization that "hope...was a flow you redirected" reweights the terminal from failed infrastructure to living system, charged by the sextant's presence and the community's embodied use. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maya, terminal, post-carnival). The cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized—which keeps the ending from the high band. The week-long resurrection montage tells rather than shows the tightening, weakening causal density in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren renounces the virtuoso dream with felt cost ("truly gone"), reframes the violin as something she can "touch again," and the final image of walking into the waking world makes the before/after legible. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density (petrichor, whispers, mist) builds toward a cadence shift when she plays, and the final image reweights the opening stakes. One tightening: the act of playing breaks the "glacial hush" and shifts her stance from flight to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, canal dock, twilight-to-dawn). The drive lens reads Causal: Marcus's trained instincts lead him from false compass to bent sundial to hidden maps, each beat narrowing his understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he secures evidence, pockets the sundial, and turns toward the city with new purpose—the cost is conceptual (his legend-seeking identity reweighted) but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (radio silence marking complicity, maps revealing the cover-up) suffices for this length, though the radio's return feels more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (Maren, golden dock, harbor village) arrive promptly. The core issue: no meaningful closure with cost. The piece ends with stated future intentions ("Tomorrow she would build a small fire") rather than an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The discovery of the fulgurite technique is presented as pure gain—she solves the chamomile problem without forfeiting anything, facing resistance, or crystallizing a stance under pressure. The inferred lens (accumulative/textural) would require a density shift or cadence break that reweights the stake with felt cost; instead the ending diffuses into benediction and summary, flattening rather than charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—Marina's profession and Thomas's loss accumulate through vivid catalog, then deepen via the pen-to-palm moment and the compass metaphor. Orientation is swift (garden, Marina, autumn, Thomas on bench). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration: Thomas's grip shifts from relic to compass, Marina chooses to stay and document healing's geography—both gestures reconfigure prior material (the thread, the missed ship) with conceptual cost (deliberate isolation, redefinition of her obituary practice). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina describes Thomas's persisting weaver's soul, narrowing his stance from loss to potential. Cost is felt but slightly abstract; the final image reweights the premise cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the prince's weeks-long assembly work, the forty-three-day incubation, and the creature's emergence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the king arrives and the prince names the achievement's cost ("Something flawed...But something that dreams"). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost—the prince has traded his sword, exhausted himself, and created something that "would never fly through open skies"—and the final image of the mechanical world growing "a heartbeat, delicate and strange" reweights the opening's "nothing sang." One meaningful deepening present; the inferred lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya's therapeutic ritual building toward Marcus's first real smile as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains abstract—"healing" is declared rather than shown through a visible foreclosure or tradeoff on the page. The grafting metaphor accumulates meaning but the final image ("Marcus smiled at her, the first real smile") asserts transformation without dramatizing what option or stance he has renounced or what price Maya pays in this specific encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure delivers a Decisive Change—trapped emotions return, fountains flow, Mara's glow fades—with visible consequence. The causal chain from breadcrumbs to constellation map to box-opening is legible under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors appear early (city, dawn, fountains). However, the geese pause as inciting mechanism remains abstract; the box's time-lock and Mara's specific role ("bridge the frozen moment") arrive late without prior setup, weakening the earn.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (who: the Keeper; where: nebula garden; when: "today's work"). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection on past cycles, present calculation via the gear, and seed-release ritual to deepen the thematic weight of hope despite pattern-proven futility. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the Keeper resumes transit "already listening for the next civilization's call" after the calculating machine gear confirms the inevitable arc, accepting endless repetition with visible emotional cost ("peculiar grief," "inevitable sorrow"). The cost is felt but oblique; the choice to continue is portrayed as compulsion rather than a decision that narrows options on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is swift (gravestone carver, autumn, monarchs migrating). The story opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elena visits the greenhouse nightly, receives lessons, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration where she "gathered her tools and the ribbon roll, ready to return" with new understanding. However, the closure unit is primarily summary and assertion ("she would carve differently now") rather than a decisive on-page act or image that makes the cost undeniable. The cost remains conceptual and the final beat tells transformation rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara completes the ritual transfer, the names join the pendulum's catalog, and the town experiences an unexplained loosening—cost is the perpetual carrying of communal grief, foregrounding endurance over escape. The accumulative lens holds across the piece; each detail (ridge, inscriptions, impossible pause, tower chimes) tightens the frame until the final image reweights the opening obsidian ridge as both searing and sacred. Orientation anchors (Mara, tower, 4:13 arrival, tidal ridge) land within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the inscriptions glow and transfer, narrowing Mara's path to completion with visible ritual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure—Mira's decision to plant a rose and preserve the letters—lands on the page with a felt cost (making private love public) and constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The story unfolds as a single continuous scene with causal linkage (sovereign case → tapestry fragment → cipher → letters → decision), and one meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded message narrows her search to the silo floor. However, the chess-clock frame (six months stipulated) is mentioned once and never constrains a choice or shapes urgency; the timeframe functions as backstory rather than live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear situational frame—Maren writes three futures for the Council—and executes it cleanly. Orientation is solid (who, where, when by ~100 words). The closure is a Charged Poise: the futures are "suspended between the written page and the choices yet to come," crystallizing the options with conceptual cost (innovation may die, extraction may collapse, warmth may be found). However, the cost remains implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; no tactical constraint or price shapes Maren's night beyond the act of completion itself.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers ritual, hidden encoding, and the glowing-dust motif to reweight narrative's persistence without a causal reversal. Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words). Closure is Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the final paragraph crystallizes the ongoing risk and the conceptual wager that "dust and air cannot be burned," foreclosing ordinary safety with felt isolation. One tightening occurs when the cultural patrol passes—Maren cloaks the dial, pressure spikes briefly—but no second reversal; the piece deepens rather than turns. The timeframe "after the story famine" remains abstract (no calendar anchor or clear "how long ago"), slightly weakening historical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (gallery, Mira, Cassius's decline) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered reveals (ash scattering, wife's urn, secret preservation) that reweight the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of gathering porcelain shards reconfigures the gallery's stated purpose with undeniable conceptual cost (the lie embedded in every "vanishing"). The rocking chair stopping provides a clear before/after. Cost is legible: Mira's practice is now exposed as duplicitous preservation, not honest release.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: sedimentary layers, competing narratives, and chronometer cogs build density toward the final image of patient artifacts waiting. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Marcellus seals evidence and ascends "surrounded by drowned streets and the abrasive calm of knowing he was right"—but the cost remains abstract (future relevance, not present forfeiture). The tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, no immediate consequence paid, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (velvet library, autumn, Mira). The closure aims for Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the art passes forward), but the cost is abstract—"something ancient and essential had been passed forward" tells rather than showing a visible price. The weekly progression compresses causality into summary ("week after week"), flattening the escalation that should charge the ending. The final image gestures at cost but does not make it undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the alignment countdown and pruning choices, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) in the final image: the greenhouse shifts from ruin to beginning, options crystallize around sharing fruit and planting seeds. Cost is conceptual—defiance of the Council and the risk inherent in "secret places"—but felt rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: blackout → drone failure → riddle → pollen insight → modified drones, with Mira's truthfulness enabling the reveal. Orientation anchors quickly (toll gate, tower, post-blackout). The closure delivers a Decisive Change—drones modified with real pollen—with visible cost (the forgotten knowledge had to be recovered and delivered). One pressure concern: the old woman's arrival feels slightly convenient, though her knowledge of "real bees, before" provides some earned setup.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maya's understanding shifts from "creeping normality" to "creeping memory," reconfiguring her documentary project and future participation. The orris root placement acts as a micro-turn that crystallizes the house's pattern. Cost is legible but oblique—her prior framework is abandoned, and she commits to active intervention rather than observation. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: cascading revelations deepen the woman's understanding through Marina's guided exposition, the ampoule's opening, and the final statues' animation. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the woman commits to telling complicated truth and the statues welcome her as guardian, reweighting the initial secret with undeniable social cost (she must now bear witness against six generations of simplified narrative). Orientation anchors early (living statue, drowned garden, woman approaching). The cost is conceptual and felt but not dramatized through a concrete forfeiture on the page; the woman's decision to "tell them the truth" is declared rather than tested, which keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: Elena's proofs lead to understanding, which triggers the rupture, which forces her stance. Orientation anchors (mathematician, infinite staircase, dice ritual) arrive within the first 150 words. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she continues climbing with renewed purpose despite proving her imprisonment is mathematically necessary—and the cost (eternal confinement now understood as inescapable) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when her scattered observations crystallize into "terrible clarity," narrowing her options from "might escape" to "must find a second door within the loop."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (rooftop greenhouse, three a.m., Mira painting). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the painting project accretes meaning through memory and the mysterious brush, culminating in a vision and resolve. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira decides to find the giver and add their face, crystallizing her thesis about kindness-as-language. However, the cost is implied rather than viscerally on the page—no concrete action is foreclosed, no visible trade-off is dramatized. The vision sequence feels more like a reverie than a pressure-driven turn, weakening the "because/therefore" linkage even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the tour structure builds density through curated objects and memories, deepening toward the violinist's thaw and Celeste's invitation, which reconfigures the dominant stake from preservation-as-exhibition to preservation-as-living-practice. Orientation is clean within 120 words (grotto city, post-flood, museum guide role). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the violinist examining grinding stones and Celeste reflecting on carrying forward "fragile, essential things" crystallizes options with felt cost—hope maintained against erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the violinist's tears unlock collaborative possibility, narrowing Celeste's isolation and opening a path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (lighthouse keeper, rocks, hunger stone). The story operates under a Hybrid lens—causal discovery (yoyo disassembly) braids with Accumulative/Textural pattern (backward clocks seed the final reversal). Closure unit is Charged Poise: the yoyo returns, time shudders, Silas feels his life "becoming unmade"—options reconfigure with conceptual cost (fate's design unraveling). However, the exact on-page cost remains oblique; the final image asserts freedom without showing what specific path he forecloses or what he loses in the reversal, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when quickly (Vera in the funhouse, post-resuscitation) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density of image and thematic pressure builds toward the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (she walks out "becoming shadow, becoming everything fear could never contain"), reweighting her curse as liberation. Cost is conceptual and legible—she relinquishes the anchor of fixed identity—but the final image leans declarative ("gloriously, impossibly alive") rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that makes the price undeniable in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard's resonance mapping accumulates through the blue hour, peaks during the three-hour tide sequence, and closes with a quiet image of survival and drift. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page—Kael's exhaustion and the orchard's survival constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—and the cost is legible: three hours of physical exertion, the transformation of desperate action into catalogued knowledge. One meaningful deepening (the fractal tide arriving and being matched) tightens options under the accumulative lens, satisfying the scope requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains causal coherence under a Causal lens: whistle → shell resonance → navigation map → expedition remains → multi-whistle question. Closure lands on the page (the turtles stop, watchers turn) with a Charged Poise reconfiguration that crystallizes the city's captivity and Mira's demand for answers. The cost is conceptual—ignorance exchanged for confrontation with shepherds—but the final image makes it undeniable. One meaningful tightening (sealed gate was deliberate) narrows options and the ending reweights the entire migration premise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal lens is clear: Helena discovers evidence, recognizes the parallel to her suppression, and decides to publish. The closure—her decision to deliver the manuscript and accept career loss—constitutes a Decisive Change with stated cost ("Her career at the state archives would end"). However, the cost remains abstract assertion rather than felt consequence on the page, and the Orientation Test reveals mild debt: "who" and "where" anchor quickly, but "when" (contemporary setting) emerges only through contextual clues like "state archives" and "independent university press" rather than direct grounding. The escalation from discovery to decision is linear without meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered memory, sensory detail, and the ritual of documentation toward a charged final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Garrett completes his offering and the final paragraph crystallizes his ongoing purpose with undeniable emotional weight. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The cost is felt but oblique: he remains isolated in his mission, and the price is loneliness and the impossibility of recovery, legible in "part of him would remain here, archived in stone." One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from technical survey to emotional excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: blackout grants access, Marcus finds evidence, he photographs it before security arrives, and he preserves proof for future revelation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise—Marcus sits calm at his station with proof in hand, options reconfigured and cost implied (risk of discovery, the weight of his grandmother's silenced struggle now his to bear). One meaningful tightening occurs when footsteps approach and he must accelerate his documentation. The cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, preventing entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by paragraph two. The piece accumulates pressure through the crafting sequence and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when Mira sits among the thousand cranes, her grief transformed into "a garden." The cost—her daughter remains gone, the shadow never reattaches to the body—is conceptually legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she teaches others, expanding the vessel motif. The "descends while ascending" metaphor is applied but doesn't constrain a tactical choice on the page, remaining largely thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with visible cost: Amal's smile before unleashing catastrophe crystallizes her choice to weaponize grief against the world (Charged Poise/nascent DC). The lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid—her hunt progresses through instrument calibration and theoretical modeling, then crystallizes into a stance of deliberate apocalypse. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 150 words. One friction: the "concentration was growing" discovery doesn't clearly narrow her tactical options before the final beat; escalation reads more as confirmation than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph), and the story follows a causal lens: chip → coordinates → drone flight → signal discovery → decision to transmit. Closure is a Decisive Change (they send their own signal back, joining the network) with felt cost (ending isolation, committing to connection). The cost remains somewhat abstract—"adding their frequency" doesn't foreclose a legible alternative path or exact a visible price in the final image, keeping it just under the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Maren's confession forecloses her protective lie and exposes Clara to the ambivalence Iris feared. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore: the watch hand discovery leads to understanding the grandfather's penance, which reframes what truth Maren withheld, forcing the confession. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Clara reveals her mother's true fear, narrowing Maren's options to confession. The cost is felt in "tempered regret softening the edges" and Clara's demand for "everything."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Situational lens: neutral territory and moon-phase synchronization create the pressure that forces both negotiators to crystallize a new stance. The closure is Charged Poise—"the work of untethering had begun" paired with Mara's resolve to demand truths—options are reconfigured with felt cost (she must now confront her superiors). One meaningful tightening occurs when the drawer pull revelation shifts the negotiation frame from terms to shared hidden histories. Cost is legible in the final image: the "difficult country" ahead and the uncomfortable truths she must now extract.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Marina at the coastal kayak launch, dawn, broken compass in lap). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: regret and gravitational metaphors build density until the kayak launch becomes the crystallization point. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Marina paddles north with visible cost (years lost, terror present) and reconfigured stakes. One meaningful deepening (the voicemail from James, the attendant's warning about the current) tightens options and commits her irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational coloring. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~200 words (late but acceptable). The baseball's impossible signature and newspaper clues create a mystery structure, but the cavern revelation resolves through Marcus's exposition rather than Maya's agency. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Maya receives instruction and takes the baseball—but the cost is promised rather than paid on the page. The time-travel premise introduces rules late without prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard walk → conjuring with spices → transformation → reunion deepens pressure through sensory intensification and pattern convergence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira's reluctant metamorphosis preserves her essential self while expanding her form, meeting her brother "where he was" with visible cost (bodily dissolution, permanent liminality). The fortune cookie's paradox ("What transforms unwillingly endures forever") reweights the opening resistance at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when resistance gives way and form loosens, narrowing her options to transformation or permanent loss.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered images (glade, cards, cracked saucer, tablecloth) toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Nadia gains "aching wisdom," leaves one card as vow, and descends with intent to "trace new hands together"—options are reweighted, though the cost reads more conceptual (lost time transformed into wisdom) than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present when the gap between traced hands "began to shimmer" and she sees lost time pooling, altering her understanding and future stance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dimension opens, Ren passes through "to bring the lost ones home," and the cost is visible in the transformation to "nearly translucent" and the sixty-three years of solitary bearing. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—grief stitching builds density until the membrane tears—and holds through the ending. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the photographs rippling to reveal the locked dimension) tightens the dominant stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lightning bugs seed early, accumulate symbolic weight, and their release charges the final image. However, the closure unit—"transformation's true texture: it felt like letting go"—delivers thematic statement rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost; Maris's internal shift is told, not dramatized through a forfeited option or embodied consequence. The washed-out bridge detour and celestial alignment function as convenient scaffolding rather than causally motivated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—the blackout creates pressure, coded messages accumulate meaning, and the final image reweights the opening. Orientation is clear early (fort, twilight, Mira's role). However, closure lacks visible cost: Mira walks away with "winking hush" confidence, no path foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The seventy-two-hour prisoner deadline introduces high stakes but remains unresolved, making the "silent revolution has begun" feel premature rather than earned. The structural choice to end on assured triumph undercuts the situational pressure the piece built.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: tidal bluff, aurora, Kaela alone. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust flares, eels shift, visions narrow, culminating in a conceptual repricing where "the pattern wasn't about understanding… it was about harnessing." The closure reweights the premise with cost (the promise transforms from burden to blueprint, and Kaela accepts the role of teacher in a frictionless world). One deduction: the cost is conceptual and felt but not materially visible—no forfeited option or renounced path is shown on the page, only a recalibrated stance. The lens holds and the closure lands; cost legibility keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (poet, observatory, storm-night vigil) arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates density through darkroom labor, the sealed envelope, and storm imagery, building to a Charged Poise closure where she decides to descend with dangerous negatives—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable. The cost (risk of state retaliation) is implied rather than felt on the page, and the final paragraph shifts into summary assertion ("the cartography of scars was also a map toward healing") rather than image, slightly softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal; the needle card + sundial cipher → invitation → Venn's decision to bring it to council forms a clear chain. Orientation anchors (glass atrium, Theodora, waiting) land early. Closure is a Charged Poise: Venn departs with the card and a promise, options are reconfigured, and the cost is visible in Venn's wrestled diplomacy and Theodora's perpetual waiting stance. One micro-turn (Venn's mask cracks) sets up the final shift without adding a second decisive change. The causal linkage holds, though the final beat leans on Venn's off-page council action rather than a fully on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph and follows a linear accumulative design: vagrant at library → Marcus arrives → they work through the night → dawn community. Closure takes the form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Solomon finds "a place where broken things grow toward light" and decides "this month's name might last," foreclosing his pattern of monthly reinvention. The cost is felt—he's relinquishing survival-by-shapeshifting—but the final image doesn't fully charge that price with concrete consequence or friction. The structure coheres under an accumulative lens but the closure moment could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tidal arbor functions as a lyric deepening that reweights Marcus's resolve. However, the closure unit—the clock ticking forward and his decision to play only his own work—lacks visible cost on the page: he smiles, packs up, and walks away with no dramatized trade-off (lost income, audience rejection, physical exhaustion). The film-reel mechanism and arbor visit feel like convenient transport rather than pressure that narrows options. The piece teaches its pattern early (film reel → magical refuge → return), but the final image doesn't make the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural closure through dream-space imagery and returning details). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seed is planted, the gray mist pauses, and specific details return ("honey and cardamom," "Kael"), reweighting the collective memory's fate with felt urgency even though weeks/months remain before fruiting. Cost is conceptual and temporal (years to bear fruit) rather than a decisive forfeiture on the page, which keeps this out of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic weight through compass, lace, and memory, arriving at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Marisol whispers forgiveness and the compass "points toward a horizon where understanding finally lived." Cost is felt—she relinquishes the demand for a spoken apology—and the lens holds. Orientation is clean. One deduction: the climactic revelation depends on Takeshi's exposition rather than Marisol's discovery through interaction with the objects, which softens causal agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a conceptual repricing where Mira reinterprets her role, with cost legible in "scattered into the world like luminous seeds." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and revelations. Orientation is clear early, and the flower code setup pays off decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing through the final image of meltwater transforming the landscape, reweighting the premise of change with felt cost in the "weighty lightness." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with patterns of ice melting and glassblowing deepening stakes. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the setting shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Plot follows a causal drive with clear linkages from inciting incident to climax; closure is a decisive change with felt cost in Maya's realization and Carson's downfall. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The seashell's reprise in the final image charges the resolution, though the police arrival feels slightly convenient but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (star vanishing, reconfiguring silence as a map). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with coherence from the fading star to Maren's realization. Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of silence summarization pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative lens holds strong with looped timelines building to a conceptual repricing at closure, where J-7 realizes thoughts come from accumulation. Cost is legible in the endured repetition and the final image of sweeping frozen patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive lens holds strongly, with because/therefore linkages from found stubs to eavesdropping to confrontation. Closure is a decisive change—walking toward accountability—with felt cost in Viktor's resignation and institutional transparency. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres in a single scene with one transition downstairs.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (garden's response proving her theory). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the plot escalates logically from Elara's actions to the climax, with no breaks in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Plot follows a clear causal chain under the Causal lens, from Renna's secret experiments to Voss's discovery. Closure lands with a decisive change—Voss's recognition reconfigures Renna's status and their understanding of physics, with cost legible in her admitted fear. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure tightens meaningfully without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through sensory details and pattern revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Celeste's inspiration crystallizes, with conceptual cost legible in her decision to learn silent language. Orientation is clear early, and causality flows logically from discovery to action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost in Mira's recalibration decision, under a causal lens where her realization drives the turn. Orientation is anchored early; the structure tightens from past reflection to present action without gaps. The persistent constraint of Eva's death shapes tactics and the final image, charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Mara resolves to act, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout; the cost is legible in the "weight of a swallowed truth" and the valve wheel as a "rosary of evidence." Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the structure tightens meaningfully with the radio confession. Persistent constraint of guilt shapes the final image, charging the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)

Closure lands on-page with cost as she embraces a new path, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's metamorphosis, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the fortune's wisdom shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Nadia's vow to change reweights options with felt cost of lost time, under a consistent accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image of her rushing home. The lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Ren passes through the dimension, driven by accumulative grief stitching; cost is legible in Ren's weightlessness and translucency, with the pacifist constraint shaping tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Maris understands transformation's texture, with felt cost on-page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, reinforced by patterns and coincidences. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through the prophecy and environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with Charged Poise, reconfiguring options as the revolution ignites, with cost felt in the imminent threat to prisoners. The causal lens holds tightly, with the blackout orchestrated by Kael and Mira's actions driving the plot. Orientation is clear early, and the sundial's role as a communication hub reinforces persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Plot follows a causal drive lens with because/therefore linkages, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure where Kaela's realization reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in the transformation of her promise. The lens holds without ambiguity, and the closure lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost ("the cartography of scars was also a map toward healing"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the envelope's revelation tightens options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Venn agrees to consider the proposal, reconfiguring options with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly from duel to revelation, with the sundial code as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no plot amnesia or teleporting props occur.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as Solomon decides to stay Solomon and the library transforms, with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure moves from past to present seamlessly, and orientation is clear within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands decisively with the clock ticking forward and Marcus's resolved stance, under a causal drive lens that holds throughout. Cost is legible in the on-page image of time unfreezing and his solidified sense of self. The persistent constraint of the broken clock shapes tactics and the final image, with clear orientation early and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as the seed planting shifts the dream-space, cost is legible in the uncertainty and time pressure; causal lens holds tightly with no breaks, and the monsoon constraint shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the whispered forgiveness and compass pointing to understanding. The Accumulative drive lens holds, with revelations from the lace pattern tightening emotional stakes. Orientation is clear early, and causality is maintained through the compass and lace as anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clear accumulative arc: repeated visits and dust observations build toward a conceptual turn rather than a discrete plot reversal. The flood, the ongoing decay/regrowth, and the late butterfly appearance all feed a coherent before/after in her worldview. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when she reconceives collapse versus transformation and accepts “the beautiful mess of becoming,” with the cost legible in her relinquishing purity. The reflective/time-compressed passages are well anchored in present sensory cues and don’t damage orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—from arson to ledger discovery to canyon retreat to pattern recognition to realization and resolve—is clean and legible under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli (heat of stone, frost patterns, the ledger in her hand) so the timeline remains clear and the orientation is strong. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reprices her survival and chooses a concrete course of action (testify, rebuild) with a conceptual and emotional cost. The stakes are intimate rather than large-scale, but the structure supports them without soft resets or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a present-time experiment framed by concise backstory, all in one coherent location, with clear causal flow from trauma → invention → test with Claire → turn toward self. The drive is accumulative/textural, and closure lands when Marina reorients the device onto her own emotions, a quiet but legible reconfiguration. Cost is anchored in her permanent deafness and the life-path she’s foregone, which suffuses the final beat. The only limit is that the middle proceeds very smoothly—there’s little structural friction or complication beyond the straightforward demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: package → lens reveals distress → realization of past error → decision to repurpose the library → lens reconstruction and new function. The structure is linear and coherent under an accumulative/textural drive; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which the library’s purpose and Meridian’s role are both redefined. Cost is present but mostly conceptual (acknowledgment of long-term failure, acceptance of “eternal keeper” status) rather than sharply dramatized. A bit more concrete friction or a specific soul-case could heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: sanctions → scarcity → Mira’s secret runs → bell motif → threat of dispersal → declaration at the arbor → communal reconfiguration. Structure is linear and coherent, with the bell serving as a clear hinge into the climax; orientation in time and space is solid from the opening. Closure functions as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: the community collectively chooses a new, shared system rather than fracture, at real ongoing cost. The one weakness is how quickly the talk of leaving evaporates once the system is revealed, with minimal on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with clear orientation, a legible drive (Marina’s search for what happens to unused love), and a beat-by-beat causal chain from arrival to healing to insight. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: unused love is located in the body and released via breath, reweighting everything that came before. The cost—the old woman’s long-held regret and emotional release—registers on the page. The stakes remain modestly scaled and the overall pressure is gentle, keeping it just below top-tier structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: find fragment → enter maze-as-lens → reach center → dissolution, with each step causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing: understanding reality’s hyperbolic structure and accepting dispersal into the garden’s memory, with a legible cost (loss of embodied self). No orientation issues; who/where/when are clear early and stay stable. The only ceilinging factor is that the pressure curve is smooth rather than sharply articulated into distinct structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear from the outset, and the causal line—decoding the keys → opening the wall → confrontation with the soldiers → choice to reveal the seeds—lands cleanly. The closure is a decisive change: her chains are literally cut and her solitary, fugitive mission becomes collective, with visible risk in exposing the vault to untested new powers. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a situational overlay, and it holds consistently. Cost is present but somewhat idealized since the soldiers’ acceptance comes quickly, softening the sense of real jeopardy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: descent to the greenhouse, statement of problem, articulation of method (collecting absences), and culmination at the forge all build toward a single closure moment. Causality is internally consistent: the client’s trauma necessitates capturing a new kind of sound, which drives the specific forging act. The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration where “breaking” is re-priced as transformation, with the cost of Mira’s mortality and sacrifices clearly present. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues at this length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single anchored scene at Emerald Station, with a clear sequence from coded flowers → self-portrait → moonbeam curtain → new role. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of theft into witnessing, plus a decisive identity change. There is some convenience in the elderly guide’s perfectly timed appearance, but within the fable-like mode it doesn’t break causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from present action to journal-triggered reflection to a closing image that reconfigures the thaw motif. Causality is modest but coherent—each reflection is anchored in a concrete act (touching the window, reading the journal, finishing the sphere). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: her commitment to crafting sanctuaries is restated in a slightly deepened way. The piece could reach a higher tier with one sharper turn where an event (e.g., an interruption or discovery) forces a new option or cost rather than gentle continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious envelope → decoded cast notes → library confrontation → reveal of past → tactical bluff with prosecutors → Carson’s fall. The Mercado scandal, childhood witness, and conditioning are efficiently folded in without breaking the single-scene window, and the prosecutors’ presence flows plausibly from Sophie’s long-term planning. Closure lands as both a decisive external turn (Carson trapped) and an internal reconfiguration (Maya re-claims her identity and reframes her fear), with a felt cost in the lost years and violated selfhood. A slight convenience remains in how much exposition Carson delivers at once, but it doesn’t fracture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: fort → booklet/backstory → current vigil → realization → commitment, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the gathering qualities of silence and the dimming star build to a conceptual turn when Maren understands the hush as a map. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she redefines “map” and chooses a path forward in the new world. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-tense loop in the courtyard, then a concise backstory shard about the university incident and the Program, then the violin encounter and realization leading to a quiet but clear closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of loops and the sudden appearance of the violin read as a purposeful pattern break that reconfigures J-7’s understanding rather than a random event. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: J-7 returns to sweeping with a fundamentally altered relationship to repetition and thought. The cost—remaining trapped in the loop while now fully aware—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious tickets → investigation → overheard confession → confrontation → decision to expose, all within one coherent night. Closure is solidly on-page as Viktor commits to returning money and resigning while the others insist the institution cannot bury it, a decisive before/after. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to track, with no orientation issues or dropped setups. The only limitation is the relative neatness and lack of serious resistance or complication once the core truth is out.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: declining luck metrics → suspicion → revelation of deliberate neglect → overnight resurgence that confronts the Council’s assumptions. The story maintains a single scene with integrated backstory, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of “luck” as recognition—is legible and on the page. The cost (risk of dismissal, years of uncredited labor) is present but not deeply dramatized in the closing beat, which keeps the stakes more intellectual than visceral. World rules (botanical sensors, rapid growth) are internally consistent enough for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: setup of station/moths → interruption by Voss → return to experiment → discovery → reveal/validation, with clear causal links throughout. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual-physics frame, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration once Voss witnesses the sideways-time hologram. The sense of “before” (secret, private knowledge) versus “after” (shared, institution-altering discovery) is legible, though the cost of that shift is underplayed. Some explanatory lines about the phenomenon edge toward summary rather than dramatized consequence, slightly dulling the impact of the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: flood → discovered program → decoded water-damage imagery → hidden gap → journal → reoriented understanding of music. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one coherent drive: follow the ghost’s code to its source. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration—Celeste’s sense of what music is and what she must pursue changes in a way that clearly marks a before/after. The cost (risking herself in a condemned, flooded space and overturning her artistic identity) is present but remains more implied than explicitly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-moment observation → illness/backstory shard → confession reveal → recalibration decision, all causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is strong via a resonant reconfiguration—Mira commits to a new forecasting stance with acknowledged cost (“more false positives”) and internal reweighting of margins. The avalanche itself remains offstage but sufficiently grounded; nothing crucial feels withheld or patched. Slightly more on-page friction around implementing the recalibration could have deepened the sense of a present-time turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: callers → fixation on the ghost shift → tunnel descent → on-site confession → decision to pursue authorities. The radio confession overlapping with her physical presence at the crime site is structurally elegant and gives the conceptual turn weight. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing and a quiet decisive change (choosing to go to EPA/police), with a legible before/after and a felt, if primarily conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: descent → artifact test → transformation vision → re-integration of the stone → projected ascent, with clear causal “because/therefore” links under a textural lens. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the act of chronicle-keeping is reweighted as participation in change rather than mere observation. Cost is hinted (she will not remember precisely; the weight is carried in her) but not dramatized in a concrete test, which keeps this from the very top band. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean and early, and the pattern never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Maya engineers the shared moment, brings the keepsake and lullaby into the eclipse setting, and these choices directly trigger the mother–daughter reconnection. Structure is simple and appropriate to the length—a single, continuous scene with brief, well-integrated setup. Closure is on-page and legible, with a before/after: Diane shifts from distracted obligation to emotionally present daughter. The cost is modest but real (confronting lost wonder and years of distance) and is acknowledged explicitly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-moment handling of pages anchors the lyric exposition, and the displaced axis revelation crystallizes the premise. Causality is more conceptual than event-driven, but the piece holds a consistent textural drive lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the final image of the historian archiving echoes after the last dream gives a clear before/after. Lack of concrete turns or options under pressure keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single bar scene revelation followed by a quiet walk-and-reflect coda, all under one POV and clear orientation. Causality is solid—her career leads to spy traffic, which leads to the man’s approach, which forces her reevaluation. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: her work and the lighthouse are reweighted, and the “before/after” in her understanding is legible though subtle. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional, not strongly pressed into a decisive external turn, which keeps the piece just short of top-tier structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story maintains a clean single-scene causal progression: the exorcism begins, Micah deploys his techniques, pressure peaks, and the entity is expelled. Orientation is strong from the first paragraphs, and the drive lens (causal with conceptual coloration) holds throughout. Closure is decisive and on-page: Elena is freed, the anchor stabilizes, and Micah departs with a reweighted understanding (“Some demons are just bad arguments”). The main limitation is that the process never feels in genuine danger of failing, softening the sense of cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single dawn session framed by her method and wrapped with a return-to-rest cadence. Causality is modest but intact—dawn enables clarity, the shell triggers memories, exhaustion eventually halts the work—and the accumulative design holds from start to finish. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she recognizes her homesickness as the engine of her fortunes and accepts the cyclical constraint of her practice with a quiet cost. The stakes never escalate beyond this interior artistic economy, but for a lyric piece they resolve with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with embedded glimpses of other timelines, all cohering under an accumulative/textural drive and culminating in a conceptual repricing of the premise. Causality is solid—her long history of crossings leads to disillusionment, which produces the choice to stop trying to “conquer” and instead inhabit the labyrinth. Closure is clear and on-page, with the shift from bridge to “real ground” and the decision to return differently. The main limitation is that escalation is more tonal than situational; there’s no concrete external complication in this visit beyond her dawning insight.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a problem on the surface (emotional numbness), descent to the cavern, discovery of a method, experimentation, then communal application and reconfiguration at the end. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens, and the closure—Mira becoming a guide and the cavern a pilgrimage site—registers as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (embracing fracture, devoting herself to this liminal space). Escalation is smooth but perhaps too frictionless; nothing meaningfully resists her plan once the journals are found. Still, the before/after is legible and thematically tight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: being followed → pigeon message → realization of the government’s aim → decision to create parallel documentation. The story adheres to a single scene with light reflective expansion and lands in a clear closure moment of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (she commits to a strategy under surveillance). Stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally tested—no on-page confrontation or hard deadline—which limits structural tension but suits the chosen contemplative mode. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, but the escalation is more intellectual than situationally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and legible: present-tense visit, brief but grounded backstory, a three-day ellipsis, and then the bloom/experiment payoff. The causal chain—Dalton’s question → reconstruction → wait → bloom → comparison → realization—is tight and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he reinterprets what scent “does” and what his grief means, with visible cost. The scale is exactly right for the length, with no dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene: arrival, encounter, shared investigation, reframed understanding, all clearly anchored in space and time. Under a primarily accumulative/situational lens, the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: time is redefined from measurable texture to chosen weave, with the rope and the wall’s deepest layer as pivot. Causality is modest but sound—each conversational and observational beat deepens the central question without contradictions or teleporting elements. The main limitation is that the decisive moment is intellectual rather than dramatized through a sharper on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → discovery of trapped sounds → realization → performance → partial restoration of sound → departure, with one continuous, legible scene. Causality holds under a textural lens: because she is sensitive to acoustics and explores, she notices the humming and the bowl, then responds with music that reconfigures the world’s soundscape. Closure (a resonant reconfiguration) lands: the hush loosens, the world begins answering again, and she leaves having altered the situation. The main limitation is relatively low on-page cost and a very gentle curve of pressure, which keeps the arc from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous session with Thomas plus a quiet coda, causally ordered from intake to emotional alteration to aftermath. Closure lands via a clear resonant reconfiguration: Maren reappraises her work as self-eroding even as she prepares to continue. The causal chain is tight, with no orientation or rule confusion, but the global drive doesn’t significantly tighten beyond “she will do the procedure, it will work, and she will live with the cost.” The lack of any late structural complication or hard choice under pressure keeps it shy of elite-level structural dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: misaddressed envelope → library visit → encounter with Theo → shared plan, with a decisive change in Marlena’s intention at the end. Structure (single continuous scene with light reflective insert) is elegant and easy to follow, and the closure unit—her commitment to action plus the reweighted view of invisible labor—is clear. However, the heavy coincidence of Theo conveniently appearing at the very moment she’s reading his letter softens the sense of earned progression. The cost of the closure is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in the scene, which keeps it strong but not outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → integration via the search → the child’s discovery → the creation and reveal of the sculpture → revaluation of what the tag meant. Causality under a textural lens holds: the search produces intimacy, which makes the sculpture meaningful, which in turn reframes the longstanding “mystery” as a pretext for kinship. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing of the premise with a felt cost (her earlier loneliness vs. the fragile new belonging). A small weakness is that no single on-page decision functions as a sharp hinge; the turns are smooth rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: observation of strange echoes → investigation → arrival at the Throat → use of time-sculpting to unlock cages → release and conceptual revelation. Structure is tight for a single scene with interleaved backstory that never muddies orientation, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what echoes are. However, the time limit and illegality are underused as live constraints, so the climax unfolds with little resistance once the mechanism is clear. The cost is present but relatively soft, keeping this below elite-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/causal arc: descent → planting/waiting → uncanny growth → epistemic shift about love and loss. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: he cannot recover his wife, but he radically reinterprets what “loss” and “presence” mean and adopts a new stance (tending the orchard). Each step follows clearly from the last, and the world’s rules (stalactite drops, glass eyes, fruit) are consistent within the lyric frame. Cost is legible in his acceptance that his original goal (reversing loss) is unattainable, even as he finds a different, quieter “answer.”

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is tight: the outage drops security, enabling Maren to move, which leads to uncovering caches, finding the tape, reorienting her purpose, and constructing a meeting that culminates in her reveal. The structure is linear and well-contained within one morning, with a clear before/after in her stance. Closure lands as a decisive change—she steps out of the crawl space and addresses the boy, and he doesn’t run—but the felt cost of that decision is somewhat understated on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is crystal clear early and never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: a storm disrupts his controlled system, which prompts re-evaluation, experiments in releasing control, and a reconfigured nursery and self. The time jump “over the following weeks” is compressed but coherent, and the closure beat (nursery flourishes as partnership, not laboratory) is clearly a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration with cost to his old identity. The structure is straightforward and solid, though the middle phase leans on summary rather than a sharper on-page test of his new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clear and accumulative: island routine → convergence at the basin → digging and exchange → sleep and reoriented artistic purpose, with no orientation debt. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the repeated cycles of tide, rain, and scavenging build toward the ritual and its quiet payoff. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the redistribution of brooches and objects enables her first voluntary sleep and redefines her subject. Stakes remain mostly internal and existential rather than situationally urgent, which keeps this shy of top-tier structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single accumulating scene: pilgrim arrives → wonder is reawakened → shadows/magic escalate → Vera reconceptualizes what’s happening. Causality is coherent (years of magnified magic draw the forces; the pearl’s awakening concentrates them) and the lens is accumulative/textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “magic” means and what Vera’s work has wrought, with the cost being her forfeiture of predictive certainty. The only limit is that the external stakes (physical danger, loss) remain mostly implied rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: broken archives → lost routes → Maris’s methodical vision-work → new charts → public test at sea → communal uptake and the valve’s enshrinement. The piece moves efficiently from problem introduction to investigative middle to demonstrative climax, with no orientation issues. Closure lands via a decisive change in the harbor’s behavior and a reconfigured relationship to the sea. The main limitation is that the weeks-long research phase is summarized rather than dramatized in discrete beats, which slightly flattens mid-story tension.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrows → abandoned district → fortress → ticket punch as key → one-truth choice → new map and life mission. The structure is linear and well-contained, with a clear before/after defined by the moment she chooses her grandmother’s truth and accepts the burden of mapping unspoken truths. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing, though the on-page sense of sacrifice (foregone other truths, long-term burden) is more implied than dramatized. Nothing essential breaks causality, but a sharper articulation of concrete cost at the end would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: isolation → discovery of the tile → vision/realization → commitment to transcribing → reframed ending. Causality is sound and the accumulative drive (each layer of understanding about whales/memory) builds toward a clear conceptual repricing of grief and kindness. Closure lands as a quiet but legible reconfiguration of Elena’s stance, though the sense of what she foregoes or risks by staying is underplayed. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph; no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: solar storm → spatial mutiny → epicenter at her escondite → fragment burns → opportunity to reach the realm of the dead → Vesper chooses to cross. Orientation is solid and the single-scene structure is tight, with a clear before/after pivot when she steps onto the impossible beach and then into the between-space. Closure functions as a charged poise/incipient decisive change, though the danger and irreversibility of the choice are more implied than dramatized, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: asylum context → missing documents → swallowed SD card → night-long vigil → retrieval and ethical framing. The story holds a single continuous scene with light interleaved backstory anchored to objects (the ink pot, prison letters) that clearly influence present choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira takes a stance that honors both truth and necessity, with cost implied in her conscious alignment away from her father’s former methods. Structure is strong and proportionate to length, though the waiting interval is told rather than dramatized, keeping escalation on the quieter side.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: morning ritual → crafting the invented girl’s history → sealing and placing it in the labyrinth, with no orientation issues. Causality is clear under a textural lens: environmental shifts (lamp frequency, changing garden) generate corresponding narrative moves in the invented story and culminate in the act of leaving it outside. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the invented histories become a physical part of the labyrinth, repricing “things that never were” as a kind of parallel archive. The main limitation is that the pressure on the day’s work doesn’t intensify much beyond being today’s iteration, so structural stakes feel modest.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—moving with the tides, gathering fragments—coheres and is easy to follow, with a clear throughline from label → investigation → purpose. The drive lens is textural: each overheard story deepens the sense of cover-up and stakes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she crystallizes into “keeper of erased histories,” but it’s a conceptual cadence rather than a decisive on-page turn under new pressure. Because no new constraint or revelation in the final beats materially alters her options, the arc feels strong but not yet fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is tightly structured as a single-session revelation: climb, set up, experiment, insight, reorientation, quiet coda. Causality is clean—shell leads to memory fragments, retelling leads to cello hums, which lead to the conceptual answer. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: her understanding of “where voices go” and of myth itself is reweighted with a clear before/after. The main structural limitation is that the answer comes smoothly once the cello hums begin, without an intermediate snag or doubt that would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—from privatization threat to secret resistance to the pivot toward cooperative ownership—tracks cleanly and culminates in an on-page closure moment at the council vote (“We reorganize together, or we sink separately.”). The drive lens is primarily causal: each development (graffiti intel, Marcus’s warning, Mira’s idea) has a clear “because/therefore” link. The closure carries cost and consequence conceptually, though we stay at a high level for the vote itself rather than seeing a more contested, dramatized decision. Structure is efficient for the length, with backstory threaded in without derailing the present line.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous operation under a time limit, oriented crisply in space and time, leading to a resonant final image. Causality is straightforward—she prepares the chemical cameras, plants the sand, dawn arrives, the reactions fire, and the photographs are taken—supporting a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the crater is lost physically but preserved conceptually, and Maya’s stance solidifies. What keeps this from a higher band is the relative lack of turns or complications; the plan unfolds with minimal resistance, so pressure never meaningfully kinks the causal line.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: one continuous scene, each step of the repair causally linked, with the ship’s departure as a temporal counterpoint. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural; closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration as the basin is refreshed and the day’s pattern continues. However, the global situation doesn’t truly change—no decisive shift in options or knowledge occurs, and the ship motif never bites into plot. This keeps the piece from feeling fully “before/after” despite its polish.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: falcon arrives → coded message → phrasebook decoding → coordinate revelation → pattern recognition → conceptual realization → poised decision for tomorrow. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “where rivers begin,” reconfiguring the premise into a cyclical model and ending in a charged poise before she ventures out. The cost at closure is primarily conceptual and anticipatory rather than dramatized, which keeps it just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dissonant bells → tuning action → three days of ritual → bells ring true, people stay. Causality within the magical premise is coherent, and the final shift (“The collapse would not come”) lands as a clear before/after reconfiguration. However, the on-page cost at closure is conceptual more than felt—her effort is asserted as significant but never tests her limits or options, so the decisive change is a bit frictionless. Still, as a quiet, ritual-based piece under a textural lens, the closure unit reads solidly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is excellent: we know quickly who Marina is, where she is, and what she’s after, and the distress signal cleanly motivates the descent. The causal chain is strong: signal → discovery of Thalia and vial → memory-transfer explanation → ticking-clock revelation → Marina’s technical gamble → collapse and ascent. Closure is decisive and on-page: Marina’s choice leads to Thalia’s release and the temple’s destruction, with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that the mechanism works on the first try with little complication, so the climax feels slightly low-friction for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: tide → looming bodies → impending interrogation → internal reconfiguration, all coherently linked. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: Marcus moves from silence as defense to speaking as a chosen risk with cost acknowledged. Orientation is strong and consistent, but the main external event—the discovery of bodies and actual questioning—remains off-page, which keeps the causal stakes modest. The drive lens (accumulative/situational) holds, yet a single on-page exchange or concrete test of his decision would deepen the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from eerie status quo to first apparition, accumulating guidance, and then a single concentrated revelation that reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact and legible—the bead’s warmth, the escalating solidity of the bride, and the explanation of the night all connect without cheats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s situation is the same physically, but her stance and purpose are decisively altered. The main limitation is that the “debt” and global stakes are stated rather than tested in a concrete dilemma, so cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: sleepwalking → discovery of pattern/plate → public proposal via textiles → community uptake → council confrontation → reconfigured precedent. Causality is coherent and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “reverence,” with Mara joining the walkers to mark the new order. The main weakness is the ease of the council’s turn; opposition appears late and dissolves quickly once evidence is shown, so pressure never truly pinches. Still, for this length, the before/after is legible and the structural arc is satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival and premise, exploratory wandering, discovery of the sundial, then reburial and communal restoration above ground. Causality is sound (her wandering leads to the sundial, which shapes the reburial ceremony and final image) and orientation is excellent from the opening. The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of faith and interruption—lands clearly. The main limitation is that much of the middle (“over the following weeks…”) is summarized, which slightly flattens moment-to-moment pressure even though it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clear and linear: decode the chalk, identify the coordinates/time, hand off pseudonyms, then reset to continue the work. The causal chain (chalk → coordinates → inference of a coordinated erasure → delivery) is coherent and satisfying, and the “twenty minutes before the courier” clock orients us. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the decision to keep writing codes and enabling these disappearances at personal and social risk. The main limitation is that the decisive change is conceptual rather than a sharp on-page turn; there’s no escalated test of that commitment within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: repeated visits and fragmented questions accumulate, Mira notices linguistic and informational patterns, deduces the coup, and decides to intervene using her persona. The single-scene structure with light reflection/backstory stays coherent and supports a clear before/after—oblivious embroiderer versus active, risking informer. Closure lands as a charged poise: she commits to a dangerous next step, even if the outcome is off-page. The cost of breaking her protective foolishness is implied rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: Isla’s regret → visit to the medium → shard and ritual → relived moment → new understanding → decision to go to her sister. The flash into the past is well framed by the shard and the medium’s explanation, so orientation and temporal logic remain intact. Closure lands as a decisive change in intention with legible cost (years of estrangement, the risk of facing her sister) and a charged final image. The only soft spot is how conveniently the sister’s own unsent letters appear, slightly reducing the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally linked beats (noticing the cast → linguistic connection → backstory → coral → decoding → joint decision) under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Maya reframes both the girl’s notes and her own past work, committing to an ongoing act of translation as memorial rather than mere mediation. The cost—Maya’s acceptance that she has been “collecting wounds” and will now actively engage with them—is present, though underplayed. There are no orientation or causality slips, but the stakes remain quietly internal, which keeps the closure effective but not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal-accumulative: rumor → journey → discovery → projection → shared experience → internal shift. Orientation is strong and early; stakes and focus never drift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“joy wasn’t lost in the past” reweights every prior image—and reads as a decisive reconfiguration of her stance. The main weakness is the relative lack of external obstacles or complications, which keeps escalation modest even as the emotional arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single scene with recursive “awakenings,” operating under an accumulative/textural lens where each reset intensifies disorientation and reweights the premise. Causality is soft but coherent: finding/prying out the nickel changes the sonic world, which alters the murals, which in turn reframes her sense of self and reality. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marta decisively reframes waking vs dreaming and chooses to “wake up again,” at the cost of relinquishing a single, privileged reality. Stakes are mostly philosophical rather than situational, but this is consistent with the design and fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: oppressive law → Malachi’s plan → founding the club → decentralized garden language → an established resistance network. Structure is straightforward with one main temporal jump (“over the following weeks”) that reads as purposeful compression rather than hand-waving. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the wild-growing language reweights the premise of taxable thought against ungovernable growth, with cost implied in the risk of audits, wipes, and imprisonment. The piece could push further by staging a concrete close-call or confrontation to more viscerally test the system, but what’s here is coherent and complete for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: postcards and solitude frame the status quo; Mira’s arrival introduces a concrete offer; descending to plant the bulb leads to a reconfiguration of what “rest” can mean. Causality is modest but coherent (postcards → sustained purpose; Mira’s gift + “blossom armistice” idea → decision to plant and share petals), and orientation is excellent from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she discovers a different mode of beauty-making that brings her closest to rest in three centuries. The cost—relinquishing total solitude as her only strategy and implicitly accepting vulnerability and mortality—is legible in that final emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: cracked chime → threat to orchids → descent to archives → discovery of the song’s function → recalibration and new chime → re-harmonized library. The single-scene structure with one transition (down to the archives) is easy to follow and the closure beat clearly reconfigures the situation. The main weakness is a lack of friction or complication; every step works on the first try, so the sense of jeopardy softens. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but it lands coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Maren’s six months of silence → discovery of the method → present-time apology and explanation → Kael’s decision to trust and rejoin her work, under the constraint of imminent physical separation. The single-scene structure is well-contained, and the “last hour before paths diverge” frames the closure as a Charged Poise. The cost is legible (they will be apart, with only their renewed promises and method bridging the gap), though an additional concrete test or snag in the present conversation could have sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: envelope → hidden message → chain → measured distance → secret valve → restored mechanism → joint demonstration. Structure is tight for the length, with one clear throughline from mandate to solution and an on-page decisive change when the bypass is activated. The closure is solid but relatively frictionless; no serious setbacks, resistance, or alternative outcomes complicate the path. Still, the DC is legible with clear before/after stakes for both villages.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-tense attic scene → triggering package → playback → confession and charged final image. Causality is sound (the device from Carmen precipitates Elena’s crisis), and the piece delivers a clear Decisive Change when she abandons her invented backstory to tell Yuki the truth. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, with the dust, pigeons, and recordings layering toward a reconfiguration of how Elena relates to her past. Escalation is more emotional than event-driven, but the closure still feels earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a surreal present frame on the terrace, backstory of the maze incident and aftermath, then a single deepening turn (the logbook’s true owner and meaning) leading to a quiet but decisive exit. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid: terrace → objects → grain-reading → revelation → redefinition of “sacred” → choice to step through. Closure lands as both Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis, with the cost of relinquishing the fantasy of a solvable “maze” of the family. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues meaningfully interfere.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear: night watch → theorizing and data work → external confirmation via the bioluminescent bloom → internal reconfiguration around belonging. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with patterns of movement and light building toward the conceptual turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, which suits the piece but limits felt cost. The implied larger mystery of “what went wrong” at the station is invoked but never engaged structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with anchored stakes, gradual discovery, and a clear conceptual turn when the crater glass reveals that paths vanish from lack of repetition rather than catastrophe. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: bird → seeds → vines → transliteration → realization → covenant. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis, with a legible before/after in Calla’s stance. The only limitation is that the revelation arrives without much structural complication or reversal, keeping the arc elegant but somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene governed by the tide window and a sequence of small, causally linked interventions that culminate in a charged final image. The closure works as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise—her ongoing “calculated dance with entropy” reweighted by the final bishop image and the encroaching ocean. However, the before/after distinction is subtle; there’s no decisive change in options or stance, more an elegant snapshot of a continuing pattern, which limits impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and linear: exile → dance → speck appears → revelation of the garden as chrysalis → decision to tattoo memories, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closing realization and chosen role as living archive form a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with implied social cost. Causal links (“because she dances with attention to gaps, therefore the speck appears; because it anchors her, therefore she sees the garden’s truth”) hold without visible contradiction. The main limitation is that the decisive change is largely conceptual, with consequences gestured to rather than dramatized, which keeps the closure from feeling fully weight-bearing at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: arrival → set-up → experiments → documentation → resolved intention to confront the developer, all under a single, continuous scene. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: we end at the moment “before everything shifts,” with the atrium reweighted as a teaching instrument and his satchel carrying that new value. However, the scene mostly documents a plan already chosen rather than forcing a new decision or irreversible turn, so the before/after divide is conceptually strong but dramatically mild. Causality holds, but pressure is low-grade and largely offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure—single night walk framed by layered memories—coheres cleanly, and cause/effect within the lyric lens is solid (box → entries → realization → choice). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus reframes his father’s burnout and his own service, and enacts it by leaving the box and choosing to go on. Backstory is anchored by present actions (opening the box, tracing words), so orientation and chronology remain clear. The piece sacrifices some dynamic turns for meditative build, but within that mode the shape is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene in the grotto with backstory efficiently folded in, building from calibration of the gauge to convergence, to conceptual breakthrough and decision to return. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens is sound—patterns → gauge spikes → multi-Maya observation → equation and revaluation of hope → renewed commitment. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing plus Charged Poise, with a clear before/after in how she understands her work and persistence. The only ding is that the “equation of hope” arrives very smoothly, with minimal on-page resistance or risk, which lessens the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: corridor entry → discovery of diaries → conceptual framework via Eleanor’s grandfather → anomaly detection → realization of architectural consciousness → revaluation of the cartographers’ work. Causality is clear at each step, and the closure is a solid conceptual repricing: the profession’s meaning and the manor’s status are reweighted. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than situational, but the final sigh and Mara’s decision to “finish the mapping” give a legible before/after. No major orientation or lens issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is tight: terrace ritual → mirrors arranged → encoded songs → first unstable vision → stronger focused vision in one mirror → conceptual turn about the heartbeat. Causality within the lyric lens is coherent, with the bells and twilight window providing a clear temporal frame and constraint. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aina’s understanding of her borrowed heartbeat and purpose shifts in a legible before/after with emotional cost. Stakes are intimate but consistent, and there are no orientation or rule-violation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story orients cleanly and early: terrace, valley, moons, and the time-boxed negotiation are all clear. Structure is tight—a single scene driven by the countdown to alignment, culminating in the shared planting and promise to return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the war is not ended, but the terms of engagement have shifted toward shared stewardship. The main limitation is that opposition never credibly threatens to derail the ritual once both parties arrive, so the path to closure feels somewhat unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: years of engineered drought → cracked riverbed map → salt flat → device activation → rain erasing the map. The single-scene structure with interleaved backstory is clear, and the closure (he’s achieved the echo at the moment the world reclaims the canvas) reads as a solid Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Reflection is heavy but well-anchored in present actions (handling the egg, operating the device, hearing the call). Nothing important is left dangling, though the present-time decision-making is relatively simple once the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: courtyard ritual → sanctuary discovery → echo-harvest → re-emergence changed. Causality within the fantastical premise is legible (her training and thread-untangling precipitate the sanctuary), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (defying her prescribed role). Stakes are primarily internal and societal rather than situational; there is no concrete consequence intruding into the scene, which slightly softens impact. Still, the before/after is clear and the arc feels complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: we begin in the post-argument calm, move into performance, hit the disruption/epiphany, and land on Marcus’s revised understanding, all in one coherent scene with well-anchored setting. Causality is sound (partner’s accusations → performance under a cloud of doubt → unexpected audience reaction → Marcus’s conceptual shift) and the closure clearly qualifies as a conceptual repricing with a modest but legible cost. Reflection about the grandmother and touring seedy bars is interleaved efficiently and anchored in present stimuli, so it doesn’t stall or confuse. The drive lens reads as Situational shading into Accumulative and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: climb → gathering → arrival of monarchs → building → departure → descent, with a clear before/after in relation to the last migration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the temporary structure remaining where no one will see it reframes the entire effort as costly, necessary witness. Causality is simple but intact; each step follows logically from the prior one. The main limitation is the absence of a distinct turning-point beat beyond the natural swell and ebb of the butterflies.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure—a single scene in the sanctum interleaved with backstory—is clean and easy to follow, and causality under an accumulative lens is strong: fire → loss → guilt → discovery → project → first successful names. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the aurora, cards, and bronze make the bells “ring” again, marking a clear before/after in her relationship to the past. The piece leans more on lyrical accretion than concrete turning points, so escalation is felt but quiet. Nothing crucial is left dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: storm → bunker → seal → directive → dream → realization → emergence, all linked by clear because/therefore causality. The drive lens reads as largely causal with a conceptual-closure beat: her decision to follow the directive into interpreted dreams produces the answer she sought. Closure is satisfying; the idea that “the path walks forward into her” is a firm conceptual repricing of the premise with a legible before/after. Stakes are contained but credible for this length, and there are no orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single night’s work that begins in quiet preparation, deepens through decoding, and culminates in a revaluation of what the tile means. Causality is sound—the discoveries unfold logically from her methods—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the covenant is recognized rather than created, and her choice to safeguard the tile and continue observing offers a clear before/after. The only limitation is that the on-page cost of this realization remains conceptual rather than sharply tested by events.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Marcus arrives with a grievance, Elena engages using her method and the sanctuary’s properties, he’s confronted with embodied memory, and this leads to a decisive emotional shift. The sanctuary’s visualizations and the music box operate as clear structural pivots, and the ending delivers a legible before/after: he moves from identity-as-resentment to carrying “the presence of choice.” Closure cost—surrendering a long-held grievance that has defined him—is visible on the page through his shaking and weeping. The piece is essentially one continuous, well-contained scene with no orientation confusion and a coherent Causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: Gregor’s death → escaped dream → threat to the district → Eliane’s mirror-based intervention → containment and return. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the piece sustains a single coherent scene to a clear closure where the primary problem is solved. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the district is preserved, but with a reweighted sense of what the fog contains. The main limitation is that the supposed catastrophic stakes stay more told than felt because the dream never quite resists or complicates her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal drive is clean: Mara’s defiance of the Guild → estrangement → months of searching → dangerous climb → confrontation → new, mutual vow. The scene holds one continuous location and escalates from discovery of Lisel to the offer involving the half-finished eye and joint work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship and the meaning of Mara’s vows are reweighted through the ribbon and shared tools. The only limit is that external Guild pressure and consequences remain off-stage, keeping the structural stakes more intimate than systemic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: curiosity about the archive → discovery of the cameo → hypothesis in the bathroom → test at the tree → conceptual flip about inheritance and identity. Causality is legible even within the nonlinear premise, and the closure is a solid conceptual repricing of “inheritance” and “curation.” The cost is mostly conceptual (loss of linear selfhood, realization about her grandfather) rather than dramatized in consequence, which keeps this from feeling fully maximal. Still, the beats link in a tight, publishable way without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: disturbance → diagnosis of the rift → confrontation with traveler → linguistic ritual → rescue → thematic coda. Structure is compact and legible, and closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration centered on the nature of forgetting and rescue. However, the rescue itself arrives with little complication or risk once the diary is introduced; there’s no real sense that failure is possible after the premise is laid out. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds, but the central problem resolves a bit too smoothly for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense wandering on the Celestine, interleaved with shifting memories, escalates into deliberate narrative “tests” and culminates in the garden manifesting. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her act of “telling it differently” and presenting the card precedes and motivates the garden’s appearance. Closure is a clear conceptual reconfiguration—she moves from seeker/observer to the “discovered,” with the cost of dissolving singular identity made legible. The piece maintains orientation and pattern from early on, with no disruptive temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: cyclical door → search for a specific artifact → discovery of the temporal split → application of Chen’s method to merge timelines, all culminating in a clear before/after. The closure is decisive and legible, with reality reconfigured and the registry updated, satisfying the causal lens. Cost is more conceptual than felt—there’s little dramatized risk that the merge could fail disastrously or that something dear to Marin might be lost. Structure is tight and publishable, but escalation and consequence could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a descent, diagnostic reading of the ice, ritual attempt, and resulting reconfiguration of the caves. Causal logic is coherent—backstory about resonance maps and the echo stone feeds directly into the method she uses at the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the caves and the beings’ presence are reweighted, and her understanding of quiet shifts. The main limitation is that the arc never feels structurally imperiled; there’s little sense that failure or unintended consequences are genuinely in play.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear: a present-tense evening before the attempt, interwoven with well-anchored reflection and discovery of the shard, closing on a charged preparatory moment. Causality holds—her retrocognition → theory of patterns → star-tracking → need for a hush shard → discovery in her shadow → repairing the prism. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the future vision and completed pattern reweight everything that came before, though the decisive external act (rekindling) is deferred to “tomorrow.” The cost and stakes are more conceptual than felt, which slightly softens the ending’s impact at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single-night arc moving from storm-peak to dawn, with the work intensifying and then resolving into a quieter reconfiguration. Causality is gentle but present: the storm enables the shadow-work, which drives Maris’s frantic measurement and then reflection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she ends by “remembering remembering,” her stance on memory clarified and accepted at a cost. A slightly more pointed middle turn (a concrete failure, loss, or contradiction in the archive work) could further sharpen the structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival → diagnosis of hopelessness → mosaic revelation → tower preparations → fireworks display → partial change and departure, with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress has “cracked,” the commander is altered, and Mara continues her wandering vocation with that cost of incompleteness. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural, with escalating images and crowd response building to the dawn shift. It falls short of exceptional because the arc is almost frictionless—there’s little sense of risk that the plan could fail or be opposed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear conversational arc from estrangement to reconfiguration, and a strong closure beat. The beats connect causally/accumulatively—silence, the cicada reveal, Mei’s reframing, the new promise about letters. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a visible emotional cost (accepting separation while staying connected). Nothing crucial is left dangling, and there’s no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: brief backstory, ascent during inversion, search/listen, discovery of the gilded hush, capture, and reflective descent. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her monthly ritual leads to the flower encounter, which precipitates the reconfiguration of her idea of enclosure. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing—her relationship to compression and openness is reframed with reference to her father’s bunkers. Stakes are modest and quiet but coherent, with no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: ascent → arrival → guided exposure to silence → departure → Mara’s reflective log, with each stage causally tied to the terrace’s function. As an accumulative/textural piece, pressure builds via sensory stripping and the measured lowering of noise rather than overt reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the storm glass and Mara’s log entry reframing grief as an ongoing transit rather than an event. The main cap is that stakes never quite tighten into a sharp dilemma, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: decoded coordinates → waterfall → orchard and walls → peeling paint → mural → doorway → stairway → throne. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: Vess fulfills the quest’s objective but consciously refuses the ultimate power, leaving the throne unclaimed with a clear before/after. The “until sunrise” clock is structurally present but doesn’t materially alter tactics or options, softening the sense of cost. Even so, the single-scene structure is tight, with no serious orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: we move from static sanctuary, to inciting intrusion (Sienna), to a conditional offer, and end with the first act of joint destruction. Causality is clear under a situational/accumulative lens: Sienna’s arrival pressures Maya’s stasis and leads to the shared burning. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR—the sanctuary’s rules subtly reconfigure to include another—at a visible conceptual and emotional cost. The arc is compact but could benefit from one more complicating beat before Maya consents to teach.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear and efficient: glitchy texts → appearance of the bolt → threshold encounter with the presence → decision to volunteer and fusion with the bolt. Orientation (who/where/what rules) is strong early, and the stakes around reality collapse and paradox are legible. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Maya is permanently transformed into an anchor, options foreclosed. The main limitation is that the middle beat (learning about quantum promises and the bolt) feels more explained than dramatized, so the leap to “I volunteer” is slightly under-tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: gramophone → standing waves → hidden compartment → deed → reinterpretation of the dynasty, with each step motivated by prior clues (journals, room design, bolted gramophone). Structure is tight and linear in one scene with embedded backstory, and the final beat delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing: the “fortune” was a myth and the dynasty’s moral ledger flips. Cost is legible—Mara’s lifelong shame and family rancor are reweighted, and her childlessness now reads as liberation rather than failure. The only minor limitation is that the investigation proceeds almost too smoothly, with little resistance or jeopardy once the tones begin.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: program discovery → first pattern test → oath and second pattern → final marionette reversal and orchard-of-possibilities, all causally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she cannot undo the past but decisively alters her stance toward it, with the orchard and apple as on-page proof. The causal throughline remains legible despite high lyric density; no key beat is elided into summary. Stakes and cost at the end are more emotional and conceptual than peril-based, but they read as a real before/after in her options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: button → first file → second file → hidden list → decision to create a new record. Structure is linear and well-scaled for the length, culminating in a charged choice that clearly reconfigures her future stance (Earned Stasis / Charged Poise). Cost is implied—she commits herself to painstaking work and to re-opening pain in the archives—but could be made a touch more explicit in terms of what she forgoes. Still, closure lands solidly under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: compromised network → lagoon rendezvous → puddle map → hidden archive → transmission → pursuit and escape. The story fits a tight single-scene window with backstory efficiently interleaved, and the closure (transmissions completed, Mira escaping into the lagoon) provides a clear before/after with cost. The Bureau’s near-simultaneous arrival during but not before completion of the upload feels slightly convenient yet remains plausible at this scale. Overall, the structure is sound and closure lands under a causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: harbor → cliff path → grotto → revelation → active suppression → new commitment, with each step causally linked under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the rules of the prism/prohecy are taught through observation, memory, then tactical use. Closure lands as an earned-stasis decision to maintain the hush, with a clear before/after in her daily life and role. The only limitation is that the danger of the prophecy remains abstract, slightly softening the felt cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: anomaly (moonstone) → experimental play (prodding paths) → constructed test (monument) → conceptual shift and transformation. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, with each new pattern of moss and architectural elaboration tightening toward the realization about transformation. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing of the arbor’s purpose and Miren’s role, though the felt cost remains more implied than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the opening and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: recurring 3:47 failures → letter/coordinates → conservatory → fountain/ashes → compass rose → hidden stairs → shrine/log → conceptual shift. Orientation is impeccable; who/where/when are clear early, and each discovery follows logically. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: Ellis redefines her role from fixer to witness, and that shift lands in the workshop coda. The only limitation is that the anomaly and hidden shrine resolve somewhat neatly once she finds the conservatory, with little resistance beyond exploration itself.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation and causal flow are very clear: past experiment → loss → failed external search → Mira’s private attempt to retrieve Kael using the same tools and space. The single-scene structure framed by concise backstory works well, and the closure (Kael’s return and her conceptual shift about names) is on the page with a legible emotional and symbolic cost. The drive lens is largely causal, but the actual ritual unfolds with almost no resistance or uncertainty once begun, which slightly flattens the sense of risk. Still, the before/after boundary—Mira’s stance on names and her responsibility—is clean and feels materially changed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival → orientation to spectral chorus → focus on one confession → musical/ritual intervention → ghost’s release → recommitment to the larger task. Causality holds under a primarily accumulative/textural lens, with each step arising from Mara’s purpose and the gorge’s rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is fractionally altered (one voice gone, method confirmed, mission deepened) with a conceptual cost around holding grief and joy together. The stakes are modestly scaled and the “before/after” is clear but emotionally quiet, which keeps this strong rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure—walk into forest → escalating surges → discovering the forest’s response → revised equations → acceptance—reads cleanly and causally under a textural lens. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the flashback material is well anchored in present triggers. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she reframes both her torture and her enhancements through the lens of transformable “cruelty equations.” The only limitation is that external stakes remain very contained, keeping escalation primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of training → search in the market → obtaining the lens via the grandmother connection → decoding the paintings → realizing the erased history → decision to confront the Guild. Structure (market scene, then workshop through night to dawn) is easy to track and the orientation is solid. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: translation is redefined as restoring erased histories, and Mira commits to using her grandmother’s method. The main limitation is that the implied future conflict with the Guild remains off-stage, so the on-page cost of that decision is more suggested than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line is clear and tight: call to inspect → ghost’s plea → search of ceiling → discovery of evidence → release/closure. The story achieves a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration: the truth is unearthed, the ghost is released, and Marcus’s role subtly redefined. Stakes and costs (the ghost’s 70-year wait; the reputational weight Marcus carries out) are legible without over-explanation. The structure is straightforward, perhaps a bit safe, but fully coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: Margritte’s arrival, first destabilizing print, confrontation, uncorking of the whisper, and the library’s new drifting equilibrium form a clear causal arc with on-page closure. The decisive change—perfection giving way to a living, uncertain system—lands conceptually and is legible as a before/after with cost (loss of certainty) even if it isn’t dramatized as painful. Exposition about the library’s three-hundred-year perfection is economical and anchors stakes without derailing the scene. The drive reads as a hybrid causal/accumulative design and holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene framed by an approaching and passing temporal storm, with backstory woven in and a clear before/after in Matthias’s understanding and resolve. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: storm → mirror-checking → shard vision → recognition of the builders’ sophistication → renewed commitment to his project. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the final overlap of reflections reweights his revolution and scholarship in light of the aliens’ own temporal knowledge. The dispute and larger world are mostly offstage, but enough is dramatized here to avoid feeling like pure exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single night’s work framed by descent and ascent, with the silent boxes as the inciting problem and their restored music as closure. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each box reclaimed deepens the central pattern rather than feeling repetitive. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the reaffirmed covenant and the image of songs braiding against darkness, though the cost of success is more implied (vigilance, effort) than pointedly dramatized. Stakes stay conceptual rather than concretely tested, but the piece still feels complete at its scale.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: factory backstory → compass arrival → journey → lagoon → realization and offering, with a clear before/after in her stance toward mystery. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step deepens the central inquiry rather than turning it, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: from collecting to pilgrimaging. Causality is coherent (compass → journey → psychometry → understanding), and there are no orientation issues. The cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatized, but it is legible in her choice to abandon tools of control and accept ongoing, non-commodified awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal and structural spine is clean: GPS failure → storm detour → archway shelter → slide discovery → layered revelations → post-storm choice to navigate and create differently. The story adheres to a single POV, one primary location, and a coherent accumulative drive, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of what “navigation” and “installation” mean. Closure is legible and earned, with the decisive change being her abandonment of GPS and static design in favor of the builders’ methodology. The main limitation is that the cost of this shift is more conceptual than narratively tested, so the climax feels contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: set-up of the pavilion/postcards, long stalled period, twilight observation, window discovery, then the night of painting and morning payoff. Causality is coherent under an accumulative lens—her attention to light conditions across seasons enables the crucial twilight beat that reveals the etchings. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the meaning of “why they wait for darkness” and Marina’s project both reconfigure at the end. The cost is modest (time, misdirected effort, relinquished scientific frame) but legible enough for a quiet story.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious letters → descent to coordinates → retrocognitive trap → witnessing the parley → return with a new stance, and the speculative rule (encryption preserving consciousness) is introduced and then paid off. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the structure—present frame, Elijah possession, return—reads as a coherent causal arc rather than a loose mosaic. Closure lands via Maya’s decision to decode and testify, making a clear before/after in how she relates to her work. The only structural softness is that her release from the “trap” is automatic at dawn rather than driven by a choice, slightly undercutting peak-agency tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/what happened with the wishes is clear in the opening), and the causal chain—refusal → discovery → study → conceptual understanding → ritual → town’s reconfiguration—reads cleanly. The piece follows a simple but coherent arc under a mostly causal lens, with a decisive change when the bottle breaks and the town is reconfigured. Closure is strong: the town’s status transforms and her earlier refusal is reweighted as the premise of a new civilization. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal; success feels almost inevitable once the bottle’s nature is known.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: foghorn silence → archival discovery → rooftop ritual → re-interpretation of the event, with the third-grade memory integrated causally via the tree. The drive reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure (conceptual repricing of the silence and the orchard’s role) lands clearly. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than situationally urgent, so the felt cost of the final stance is muted. Still, nothing essential is confusing or unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is tight: discovery of the missed seed → invocation of the vortex → confrontation with the cost → renunciation. Causality is clean under a largely causal lens; each step logically follows the previous beat, and the flashback to the egg and grandmother is well-anchored by present stimuli. Closure as Earned Stasis is solid: she forecloses the path of restoration through borrowed time in favor of starting over, with on-page cost (accepting loss). The only shortfall is that the thieves and their theft sit entirely offstage, keeping the external plot pressure a bit abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: solstice hush → anomalous vibration → realization of imminent inversion → choice of warning method → communal response → storm test passed → redefinition of her role. Closure is solidly on the page as a decisive change in how the sanctuary responds to danger and how her work is understood. The global cost feels somewhat light—there’s no near-failure or concrete repercussion beyond implied risk, which keeps the ending from fully biting. Structure stays within a single, continuous scene with backstory woven in cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—nightly ritual → meteor shower intensifying → lantern pattern discovery → dawn and inner shift—is clean and coherent under a textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s stance toward his solitude and “brokenness” changes, with the cost of relinquishing his self-punishing narrative. Causality is modest but solid: his choices to maintain watch, to draw, and to attend to the lantern enable the final insight. Stakes remain small-scale and internal, but for this length the arc feels complete and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line—notice box → notice anchored ghost → decipher her pattern → solve the box → reveal the names → accept the role—reads clean and satisfying at this length. The structure is essentially a single through-line puzzle scene with light reflection, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Silas’s role in the world is conceptually re-priced. Stakes are modest but coherent, rooted in meaning rather than survival, and the ghost’s release is a clear consequence. A slightly stronger sense of what would be lost or broken if he failed to open the box would push structure and cost higher.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: urn → capsule activation → Chen’s message → Marcus’s reframed purpose, all contained in a single, well-oriented scene. Closure lands as a decisive change in understanding and intention rather than a dramatic event, and the before/after is legible. The cost—ongoing responsibility to his community and the weight of inheriting a system—is implied rather than dramatized in a sharp on-page moment. Structure is elegant and unfussy, but the resolution feels a touch too frictionless for top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene progressing from solitary observation to encounter, demonstration (kite), and a quiet closure with a clear before/after in the young man’s stance toward writing. Causality holds—each physical event (feather, conversation, kite snapping) builds logically toward the conceptual reconfiguration about incompleteness. The closure beat, with his laugh and request to return, lands as a modest but clear Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost implied rather than dramatized. Stakes are small-scale and inward, yet coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diagnosis → choosing the caretaking post → discovering structural failure → devising and executing the copper–oak fix → stabilizing the temple and preparing the handoff. The time-compression across months is handled smoothly via summary, and the closure—her death after completing the work and leaving a final entry—is legible with clear cost. The drive reads as primarily causal with an accumulative thematic layer, and that lens holds through the ending. The only limitation is that the middle problem-solving proceeds with minimal complication, so escalation is more linear competence than pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: arrival at the tower → recollection of the visitors’ charge → discovery of footprints and formulas → realization about time/homecoming, with clear because/therefore links. The drive lens feels hybrid but leans accumulative/textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “homecoming” and the amber’s meaning. Closure lands: by the last paragraph, her understanding of origin, self, and time is decisively reweighted with a felt conceptual cost. A minor quibble is the suddenness of the “quantum-printed footprints” explanation, which relies on a soft, somewhat hand-wavy leap in the logic of time without much on-page testing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single scene that progresses from arrival to departure, with bird-guided micro-decisions accumulating meaning. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each bird call alters tactics (where to plant, when to return), and the owl’s call triggers the conceptual closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield has been reframed as the cradle of a swimming garden, with a clear before/after in how the place is understood. The only ceiling on the score is the relatively low level of concrete jeopardy or constraint shaping his options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clean: cylinder arrives → riddle decoded via the wax leaf → coordinates discovered → journey → reunion → decision to “find the living.” The structure holds to a clear before/after—retirement in isolation vs recommitting to connection—with no orientation issues and a legible lens of causal progression. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same skills used for finding the dead are now re-aimed, with an implied cost in reopening wartime wounds and leaving her settled life. The main structural softness is that the three-day journey is elided so cleanly it never quite tightens stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single accumulative scene: initial orientation to the deck and time dilation, then progressive deepening of Kira’s project, culminating in a reframed understanding of true north and pariah-hood. Causality is simple but coherent: station shutdown → isolation → sketching as response → new way of seeing and self-positioning. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing around true north and pariah status with an implied cost (irretrievable separation from her family’s timeline). Structure is tight; the main limitation is that no beat forces a disruptive turn or hard choice beyond the initial off-page refusal to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: broken sundial → ascent of the spire → recognition of corrupted pieces → deliberate swapping → restoration of the sky and her role. The piece delivers a decisive change (world and role both reconfigured) with clear before/after legibility. The structure—a single, continuous ascent and ritual—is tight and well contained for this length. The main weakness is an almost frictionless success; no move seriously threatens failure once the board is revealed, which softens the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: orientation is quick, the method develops stepwise, and the closure is a conceptual repricing where the gallery becomes an archive and the pawns’ “moves” supplant their absence. Causality is coherent—her experiences as a crisis actor lead to her survival tactic (walking), which leads to discovering the gallery and then the archiving method. The ending cadence (“The pawns would be remembered after all.”) clearly crystallizes a before/after without over-explaining. It could edge higher with a slightly sharper on-page hinge moment where the pressure on her project or its risk spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: amnesia and pain → years of avoidance → nightly visits to the stone → feather-triggered breakthrough → new purpose in the greenhouse. The piece reads as a mostly continuous shard with a reflective dive, and closure is clear in Isla’s conceptual shift about home and her decision to teach the tactile language. The feather is a slightly convenient catalyst, but it doesn’t break logic, and the story maintains a coherent hybrid causal/accumulative drive. Cost is legible in her acceptance of past loss and the relinquishing of her prior self-protective erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: exile → arrival in cursed village → discovery and decoding of tapestry → realization that self-forgiveness is the key → act of forgiveness breaks the curse. The story offers a solid Decisive Change with a clear cost (the village freed, but exile persists) and no major causality gaps. The main structural weakness is that her discovery and decoding process encounters little friction, so escalation is more linear than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: exposure painting → girl’s suicide → impending ritual → Mira’s attempt to “refract” truth via echoes → realization of failure → acceptance of judgment. The single-night structure, framed by “Tomorrow, the ritual…” and closed by the walk toward the pale spire, provides firm temporal and structural boundaries. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis; her stance toward truth and punishment shifts in a way that clearly forecloses her earlier plan. I see no orientation or lens-clarity issues, and cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: pressure from the encroaching acid wave interlocks with the puzzle of the statue, moving through realization → execution → final ambiguous choice. Causality is tight (recognizing the pockmarks as a map, then racing to fill them, then the workshop surviving as a consequence of completion). Closure lands as both a decisive change (the enchantment holding the workshop) and a conceptual repricing of “damage,” with only minor convenience in how neatly the magic works.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: receipt of the shell prompts the cave visit; the wrong turn leads to the hidden chamber; the experience there drives a concrete change in Marina’s stance and subsequent action. Closure is strong: she forecloses her prior mode of life (and art) with visible cost and a new trajectory, a decisive change rather than a vague mood shift. The structure—brief past setup, cave scene, then brief post-cave consequence—fits the length and maintains orientation without confusion. The only small drawback is the slightly “neat” alignment of letter, shell’s arrival, and epiphany, which reads a touch constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal line is clean: Silas’s charge → Mara’s dawn choice with the vial → internal shift → apology when Vera arrives. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when) and the story maintains a single continuous scene with one quiet but definite turn (opening the vial) leading into closure. The ending delivers an on-page Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara abandons her old stance and risks a small apology that transforms the relationship. The cost of those seven silent years is acknowledged in the text, giving the closure real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a present-tense midnight call framed by brief context of the failed hydraulics and the ongoing “reverse migration,” landing in a poised ending where Mara waits for the next call. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with the woman’s river image leading to a concrete instruction and resolution. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: the pattern is affirmed and reweighted as personal practice for her own hoped-for reunion. The main limit is that the on-page beat resolves a bit too smoothly, without a stronger mid-scene complication or hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: world premise → discovery of relic → research and doubt → trial of the object → altered state and new mission. The structure (orchard, cabin, experiment, aftermath) is straightforward and easy to follow, with a clear before/after shift when the “door” closes. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual and emotional cost, though the path is slightly low-friction—no real obstacle or reversal once the eye is found. Still, for the length, the single tightening and payoff are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the body → discovery of the flower → onset of memories → return to the dock to decode the gesture → decision to release the Edelweiss. The structure alternates present investigation with memory-shards in a controlled way that leads to a clear conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands solidly with Margit’s choice to let the memories sink, carrying a visible emotional cost. A minor weakness is the slightly expository info-dump about Ernst’s research, which could be more dramatized but doesn’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: grandfather’s maps and promise → rising creek/ants/light → discovery of the cavern → confrontation with the door → decision. Closure is solidly a Decisive Change: he opens the door and steps through, with a clear before/after in his stance toward passivity. The cost—abandoning his life and the safety of indecision—is conceptually present but under-emphasized on the page, so the climax feels slightly too easy. Structure (shop → creek → cavern → door) is linear and coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: repeated dreams and messengers → decision to climb → grotto encounter → vision of branching futures → resolved return with new stance. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the single continuous arc fits the length well. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: she returns to rule with a reconfigured understanding of destiny and agency, with the climb and visions as the price. The main limitation is that the “branching futures” sequence is gestured at rather than dramatized in detail, softening the sense of structural consequence somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is tight: arrival → revelation of oncoming blindness → reevaluation of purpose → concrete new plan and commitment to stay. Causality is coherent under a primarily causal lens, and the closure—her decision to return in a different way, with a new use for her suns—is legible with emotional cost. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation issues and one central, escalating problem. The only weakness is that the professional cost of her choice is mostly implied rather than dramatized or confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: cabin present → memories and theories → a crystallized stance in the final image. Causality is soft but intentional; the story uses a mosaic of episodes to build toward the grave/time-horror realization and her decision to keep writing. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR—she accepts her role as chronicler in a broken chronology—with the cost implicit. The slight weakness is escalation: the beats accrete more than they distinctly turn, so the before/after, while present, is somewhat gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single visit to the shop that causally leads from collecting the clock to a conceptual turn about loss and meaning. Setups (her loss of smell, her work, grandmother’s attachment to the clock) pay off in Mr. Chen’s philosophy and her final reframing. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing—she now carries the clock as “proof” rather than burden—with an implied emotional cost, and there are no causality or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene framed as “the breath between storms,” interwoven with a single, relevant backstory thread (grandmother’s superstition and the fire) that directly shifts Kael’s tactics. Causality is clean: exam pressure → remembered superstition → reframed quirk → original rune → mentor’s recognition. Closure lands as a decisive change in self-conception and social status (apprentice to scholar), with the cost of vulnerability (visible scars, revealed quirk) clear on the page. Stakes remain intimate rather than expansive, but fully coherent under a causal, internally driven lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, time-bounded encounter with a clear before/after: they move from estrangement to a charged, partial reconnection. Causality and situational pressure are coherent—the impending destruction of the archive/orchard motivates the meeting, which in turn produces the apology and Derrick’s stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he withholds forgiveness but acknowledges the visit’s value, and the final image reweights what preceded. Nothing crucial feels elided or patched, and the reflective elements are well-anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: walking the library while reflecting, then a conceptual reconfiguration at the end when separation is revealed as illusion. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and the pattern of deeper chambers mirroring deeper questioning is structurally sound. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—his role and the library are re-understood—but the cost of this shift stays mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. The beats “dictionary → junction → leave book → walk on as walls thin” form a clean, if quiet, progression.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: whistle → waiting protocol → decision to invert counting → key/hidden mechanism → realization, all in a single continuous window. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure delivers a clear conceptual repricing of what “measurement” means. The hidden keyhole in the floor is a mild convenience but feels foreshadowed enough by the inherited key and her role. Stakes remain mostly philosophical and the hour-wait constraint never fully tightens, so escalation is more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: investigation → discovery of the breach → confrontation → ethically charged decision, all in one coherent window with brief but well-anchored reflection. Causality is intact (her methods lead to the passage; the passage leads to Marcus), and the final offer of a “volunteer program” functions as an on-page reconfiguration of options. Closure is solid—she changes tactics rather than simply catching an intruder—but the investor/Reeves threat remains offstage and somewhat abstract. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a thematic overlay, and that holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: library → reflection on father and notebooks → syllabus drafting → call from rehab → decision to visit, with each beat logically arising from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn—Mira reframes both probability and her relationship with her father and chooses a path forward with him and with teaching. Causality is modest but intact; nothing feels contrived or teleported. The only thing holding it out of the top band is that the central pressure never quite tightens into a true dilemma—her path forward, once glimpsed, is relatively unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the opening present-tense scene, followed by a series of vignettes explaining Iris’s pattern, then the seventh-night turn where she begins making calls herself, and finally the return to the booth and the charged final image. Causality is more conceptual than plot-driven, but the progression from listening to gentle manipulation provides a legible before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the loop is reframed as necessary proof that nothing truly ends. The main limitation is that the “system explanation” section sits close to exposition, mildly flattening dramatic movement even as it clarifies mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-time walk and ritual on the jetty framed by a single catalytic event (the locket’s arrival) and interleaved backstory that directly tilts the present choice. Causality under an accumulative lens is tight—each reflection (ashes scattered here, covenant begun, archive turning mausoleum) builds to the decision to re-enter her own grief and revise the covenant. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she will continue archiving but under a new inner logic, with visible emotional cost. There are no orientation or lens-clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: a single scene at the station, an opening logistics crisis, the arrival of the young man, and an internal turn that reconfigures the story’s drive. Causality is coherent, from Budapest/Bucharest/Bratislava chaos to her specific rumor-chain solution to the emotional pivot when he names the void she feels. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from treating logistics as a proxy cure to seeking connection directly, with the cost of vulnerability. The external stakes (emergency in Bratislava, his village’s needs) stay mostly offstage, which slightly softens the sense of structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: enter forest during the celestial pause → begin dowsing → discover scattered notes → recognize her wife’s melody → reach the clearing and stillpoint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the story honors it by letting sensory and emotional density build toward a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure is strong: kneeling at the silent center, accepting that love and grief share coordinates, is a clear before/after with cost (she relinquishes the fantasy of a total map). There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though the path is smooth enough that tension never feels sharply constricted.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: past mistake → discovery of the pen’s effect → exploration of alternate readings → sending seven reports → settlers’ response → reframed understanding. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: what counted as “wrong” shifts in light of multiplicity. The structure is mostly reflective and telescoped, so key beats (experimenting, waiting for the response) are told at a distance, softening the sense of immediate cost. Still, the before/after is legible and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating sensory and conceptual insights toward a clear internal reconfiguration. The causal chain (Celeste’s insistence on the camera → observation of waves → reconceptualizing silence → choosing creation over grief) is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event, but the before/after in Marina’s stance is legible and on the page. Stakes remain entirely internal and modest in scope, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal drive is clean: arsons → going off-grid → following artistic breadcrumbs → archive → decoding → decision to broadcast. Closure lands as a charged choice to leak everything, with emotional cost (risk, grief, permanent outlaw status) legible on the page. The structure is mostly one continuous scene with backstory efficiently braided in, but opposition and complication are almost entirely off-stage, so the climax feels a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clean single scene with a clear orientation (who/where/when) by the end of the first paragraph, and the accumulative/textural drive lens is consistent. Causality is modest but coherent: disobeying the “silent hours” rule → deepening engagement with the garden → intensified drumming → charged departure at dawn. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment: she accepts continuing the experiment with a newly articulated identity and cost. The price—ongoing burden of thirteen lifetimes and the ephemeral nature of the communion—is legible but remains conceptually gentle rather than viscerally acute.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor-seeding → Voss arrives → negotiation over maps → Mira’s conditional deal → pattern analysis → storm-timing insight → server bust → Mira’s leveraged exit. The geomagnetic storm and shifting labyrinth are well-integrated structural constraints, and the “key is time” realization is an organic solution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira has traded expertise for future access to the container truth, with a clear before/after in her power. The main weakness is that the father-container thread remains promised rather than partially paid off, making the cost feel more conceptual than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean: secret → paralysis → guardian’s demonstration → realization → confession → rescue → role inheritance. Structure is tight—a single core scene with a brief coda—and closure lands clearly with Mara’s decisive action and the reconfigured final image of her as a new guardian. The only slight softening is how neatly the external outcome resolves (the brother found alive exactly where indicated), which trims some lingering cost. Still, the before/after in options and self-understanding is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean and legible: noticing the deepened silence → conceiving the rebellion → organizing the windows → the synchronized night → next-morning aftermath. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each step follows sensibly from the last, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (children now louder, questioning) that clearly contrasts with the opening. Closure lands, but the decisive “cost” is understated—her risk and potential consequences remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Still, as a quiet, concept-driven piece, it holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: island appears → she goes out → discovers scrimshaw linked to pirates/brother → whale’s call deepens pressure → she reinterprets her role and relinquishes the object. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the single continuous scene holds under a situational lens. Closure is a decisive renunciation (“I was never meant to be a weapon” and dropping the scrimshaw) with clear before/after stakes and cost. The structure is simple but well-shaped for the length, with no extraneous turns.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with integrated backstory and a clear accumulative drive: narration → whittling → voice crack → silent removal of the bouquet. Causality is emotional rather than event-heavy but coherent: the turbines and Mandate history funnel into the present question of how to grieve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she stops narrating and allows an unframed act, with the cost legible in the emptiness and “beginning of…permission to feel.” There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues at any point.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival → sensory engagement with the colonnade → paraphrasing → interior realization → commitment to write, with each step arising coherently from the last. The drive lens feels accumulative/textural, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes boundaries as constructs and begins writing new scripture. Cost is implied (defying a once-lethal ban, rejecting council authority) but not concretely dramatized, keeping the change more conceptual than pressured. Orientation is strong throughout; no causality breaks, but escalation is gentle rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single causal arc: Mira composes the plant-message → Fen is drawn out → she demonstrates her vision → he reconsiders his “failure” piece and barters for a new way of seeing. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the phoenix/kiln frame is efficiently threaded back in via the twisted vase. Closure lands as a clear decisive change: Fen chooses imperfection and a new working method, with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the cost of this change is stated more than dramatized, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight: a single scene that starts with a clear problem (corrupted pilgrimage data), introduces a disrupting agent (bell ringer), and ends with a redefined project and purpose. Causality is clean: the stranger’s challenge leads to an experiment, which leads to Karim’s conceptual shift and the joint decision to rebuild. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after is legible and scaled appropriately. If anything, the night’s work proceeds a bit frictionlessly once she agrees, with little sense of potential failure or irreconcilable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: the commission arrives, the pendant is crafted step by step, backstory is interleaved, and the final star-gazing moment reweights her work with a new sense of “language.” Causality is straightforward—each action in the workshop arises naturally from the last—and the observatory frame keeps time and place anchored. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: by the end, Mira’s practice is reframed from survival tactic to fluent engagement with grief, with the cost of her past loss still present. The only limitation is that pressure never quite tightens into a true decision point; it’s a deepening meditation more than a felt crossroads.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear and efficient: one continuous scene with reflection interleaved, anchored early in time, place, and POV. The causal flow is mostly conversational and expository, with the key structural turn being Mira’s choice to reveal her grandmother’s work and her theory of cultural cycles. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: human belief systems and crashes are reframed as geometric, inheritable patterns. The main weakness is the low sense of consequence—understanding this map doesn’t yet force a new decision or visible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: journey to the archive, activation, revelation of the Keltharan downfall, then a decisive change in Maressa’s stance. Causality is tight and legible under a hybrid causal/conceptual lens: because she activates the console, she learns the cost of preservation and therefore chooses not to exploit it. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she abandons her original professional drive with visible cost while revaluing preservation itself. The only slight ceiling is that external obstacles are minimal, making the plot feel more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present task → two contrasted recordings → reflective contextualization → edge-of-library beat with the stone as closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each paragraph deepens the core situation until the final image reweights the whole piece. The closure—recognizing the honesty of the fading smudge and reaffirming the stone’s weight—is a solid Conceptual Repricing with a visible emotional cost (her work’s impotence versus her need to keep doing it). There are no orientation or causality slips, and the past vs. present material is integrated smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Adrian’s confession → Mara’s moral dilemma → the night of decision where she drafts reports, proposals, and resignations. The piece maintains a single continuous window and uses reflection to sharpen present-tense choices rather than digress from them. Closure is decisive and on-page: by dawn, she has foreclosed the path of complicity and committed to an independent, ethical program at real personal cost. The structure is straightforward rather than daring, but it fully satisfies the scope and closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense convalescence interleaved with tightly anchored backstory that all points toward the closure beat. The displacement incident, the tower study, and the plant telepathy each causally feed the final reconfiguration. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: her power hasn’t “failed” but rerouted, with the cost of living with that scar and limit. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal throughline, and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: discovery → pattern recognition → global release, all under a single, coherent drive. The closure is a clear decisive change and conceptual repricing when she projects the letters into the empty theater; before/after is legible and emotionally charged. Some middle material (“after weeks of reading…”) leans on summary rather than dramatized turns, which slightly flattens escalation. Nonetheless, causality holds and the ending pays off the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from observation to deciphering to activation of the archway, with each step logically arising from the last. The accumulative drive (intensifying aurora, more meteors, louder voices) coheres, and closure lands when she becomes the conduit and the portal opens—an on-page resonant reconfiguration. Causality stays intact, with no rule-breaking convenience solves. The cost remains a bit abstract (overwhelm and implied self-effacement as doorway) rather than dramatized as a sharp before/after sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from establishing the post-burn status quo, through her attempts to work the archive, to a small but meaningful breakthrough (the clock’s tick and gathering sparks). Causality is coherent under a textural/quantum logic—her singing and clock-pressing lead to a branch collapse and new knowledge bleeding in. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: we end with a reconfigured sense of time and possibility, plus a renewed, slightly altered stance toward her task. The cost is mostly conceptual (remaining in superposition, working endlessly) rather than dramatized loss, which keeps this just short of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: waking → orienting → discovering the gear’s function → systematically unraveling trees → reinterpreting them → final reframing of the sixth sense and his journey. Causality holds within the lyrical frame, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of his condition from curse to opportunity—lands clearly. The main limitation is that the on-page cost of this realization is soft; the piece never forces a consequential choice or sacrifice in the present scene, so the before/after is more intellectual than dramatically pressured. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, with no lens ambiguity by the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure of seven stations, each star reweighting a different sacrifice, is clean and purposeful, culminating in the final “star for arriving” and the transfer of the punch. Causality is simple but solid: her history of staying leads to this rite, which leads to a reframed understanding of courage and a new role for her. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after: from seeing herself as depleted to recognizing stored, redirectable courage. The only slight limitation is how smoothly and tidily the ritual maps to her life, leaving little room for structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation is swift, the avalanche backstory and hotel conversion are integrated without bogging, and the discovery of the ash-notes is a clear tightening turn. Causality is modest but intact—her staying, listening, and noticing lead to understanding, then to the choice to sing and to leave the bolt on the stair. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts remaining in a compromised place but refuses erasure. Nothing crucial is summarized off-page, and the before/after of her stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: a dying, time-locked library forces Kael to act through books, escalating to the final Chronicle that conceptually defeats Orian. The structure is linear and legible with one dominant drive (expose the false king), and the ticking collapse supplies a credible deadline. Closure works as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: she chooses to finish her work and dissolve, and the world is reweighted by irretrievable truth. The off-page resolution with Orian is a bit summarized, softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the causal chain—data anomaly → atlas page → recognizing the pattern → reframing the currents—tracks smoothly. The structure is essentially one investigative beat that tightens as more information is layered, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure is solid: Maya’s understanding of “recovery” and of her work’s meaning shifts on the page with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the stakes remain intellectual and conceptual, with little concrete obstacle or resistance to complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: walk through ruins → hum intensifies → hidden markings and constellation alignment → new understanding of the rebellion → decision to act. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “failure” into “lull,” with a plan that marks a clear before/after in Kira’s options. Causality is modest but coherent: if she didn’t come barefoot, use the glasses, and read the stars, she wouldn’t reach this decision. The cost is more implied burden than dramatized sacrifice, but it’s legible enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: plant-distress → kite → script → cave → amber → unsealing → charged future. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise hybrid: she breaks the amber and explicitly commits to a new role, with the world’s options reconfigured through the embryo’s emergence. The cost is primarily conceptual—risking an engineered, unknowable future—but it’s clearly implied in the plants’ simultaneous fear and eagerness. Structure is tight for the length, with no dead turns or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: a single continuous morning anchored by routine, backstory woven in via present cues, and a helicopter-triggered spike that tightens everything introduced earlier. Causality under a textural lens is clear—sensory triggers → somatic panic → chosen coping strategy → renewed engagement with work. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she reaffirms tending what can grow despite unresolvable loss, with tangible cost acknowledged. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the lighthouse/automation frame cleanly bookends without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, single-room structure is tight: arrival → discovery of box → walls closing → frantic pattern-assembly → conceptual shift. Causality is clean (touching the box triggers the contraction; working the pattern halts it), and the before/after stance is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: fragmentation becomes truth rather than problem, with the library expanding in response. The only limitation is that the external jeopardy (crushing walls) dissipates without much lingering cost beyond the insight gained.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: investigation → discovery of the ink → revelation via drone footage → conceptual leap → decision. Causality holds under a Causal/Conceptual lens, and the closure lands as a charged poise where her future path and its cost are made legible. The flashback to her brother’s death is well-anchored to a present stimulus (the ink patterns) and reconfigures the stakes. The piece might benefit from one more concrete obstacle or counter-pressure in the present, but the core turn is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: meteorite letter → recognition → realization about the networks → decision to activate → transmission. Structure is clean single-POV, single-location with reflection woven in and anchored to present stimuli. Closure is decisive (she transmits) with a clear before/after in world-options, though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. No major causality breaks or orientation issues, but the climax could press more concretely on immediate consequence rather than implied future upheaval.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one contained scene with a causal throughline from his arrival (bringing implied danger) to his decision to learn her method. Stakes and motivations are legible from the outset, and the key turn (“Show me how you do it”) arises naturally from the prior tension with his weapons. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a large external event, but the before/after—hunter outside her ethos vs. entering it—is clear and satisfying. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: sleepwalking constellations disrupt the garden’s predictability → the hunt for an unusually elusive god-echo → the risky tactic of voicing silence → anchoring the rail spike → bringing the laugh home to change the daughter. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid within the first paragraphs and the story maintains a single, legible drive to closure. Closure lands as a decisive change: the daughter speaks and the cosmos subtly resets, with Mira’s prior choices clearly enabling the outcome. The main structural limitation is how smoothly success arrives once the method is invoked—there are no real setbacks or hard tactical adjustments under pressure, which softens the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: discovery of the nib → call from Marcus → philosophical self-interrogation → examination of evidence → decision to correct the record. The single temporal arc from morning call to sunset meeting is clean, and orientation is never in doubt. Closure lands as a decisive change (choosing to publish the correction) with a legible conceptual and reputational cost. The only ceiling on the score is that the external pushback remains mostly projected rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: lab → haunted firmware → impossible letters → time-folding event → self-tattoo closure. Causality holds under a lightly speculative frame, with the temporal anomalies and firmware behavior consistently tied to the lab’s logic and the amber. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lab shifts from tomb to temple, the pendant is materially altered, and Mira’s stance toward her own “dissonance” changes with cost. A minor limitation is that the generational backstory is delivered almost entirely via letter rather than dramatized friction, keeping the conflict somewhat mediated.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story uses an accumulative/textural drive: Isla’s ritual, the woman’s arrival, and the tile’s placement gradually reconfigure the central question of how meaning survives “the unlearning.” Causality is clean—her decision to integrate the tile deepens the hush and precipitates the emotional disclosure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: meaning is reframed as communal, messy, and relational with a tangible emotional cost in the mother’s grief. The piece is structurally tight and self-contained, though the stakes stay gently scaled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear present-time ethical dilemma, interleaved with retrocognitive glimpses that are causally triggered by the damaged tessera. The drive is situational/causal—should Vessa expose the truth or not—and closure lands when she removes the tessera, foreclosing one path at visible cost. Causality is tight and easy to follow; no set-up is left hanging. A slight additional on-page pushback (another character or concrete external consequence) could have intensified the structural pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: Celeste discovers the coin, senses the young man’s despair, enters the garden, performs the ritual, and the ending reconfigures her idea of an “encore.” Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—her synesthesia leads her to act, the song activates the garden, which in turn shapes the man’s future encounter with the shop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from craving applause to valuing having changed a life, with the coin settling on the Star as a concrete marker. The main limitation is that much of the “action” is visionary rather than contested; there are no real obstacles pushing back on her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: pills → recall → Iris’s loss → static shock → experimental mapping → medical application. The static-shock inciting incident is a bit convenient but still grounded in the studio’s practical work and pays off structurally. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they haven’t solved telepathy or cured Iris, but the world’s options have shifted via the lexicon, with visible cost (ongoing disability, transformed relationship to hope). The single-scene-plus-elliptical-time structure (weeks of work, then a one-year skip) is efficient and never disorients.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: exploration → detection of nonhuman patterns → decision to speak as the world’s voice, with a clear single scene and one temporal window. Causality is soft but legible (her tools detect anomalies, so she dives deeper and then broadcasts), and closure as a charged poise is intact. The ending offers a before/after in role—cartographer of human residues to interpreter of a conscious Earth—but the shift is mostly conceptual, with limited felt cost. Overall it’s coherent and publishable, but the lack of a sharper hinge moment keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: strange jar → instinctive re-sorting → pattern recognition → decoded prophecy → public revelation. The structure (warehouse work → three days of cataloging → town square) is legible and appropriately scaled, and the closure is a solid conceptual repricing of “prophecy” with generational cost clearly articulated. What holds this back from the very top tier is the relative lack of friction or obstacles once she begins decoding; nothing meaningfully threatens to derail or complicate her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: pillbox → retreat to weather station → discovery of snow-codes → reply via barometric readings → Marcus’s arrival → decision to resume the mission. The piece holds a clear Causal/Hybrid drive and delivers closure via a Decisive Change—Claire commits to leaving safety to finish the mission—with a legible cost (abandoning her constructed anonymity and re-entering a lethal world). Backstory is integrated through the present frame and doesn’t derail orientation. Stakes and mission specifics remain somewhat abstract (“stop what’s coming,” “vault in Berlin”), but not so much that closure is harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene, clear orientation, and a simple causal spine (we wait for the gutters; they stop; they cross; she’s internally reconfigured). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she reframes the contract and her mother’s intent, with the crossing mirroring that shift. Still, the legal deadline ("before dawn") never comes under concrete threat—dawn arrives just as needed, and no meaningful alternative path is tested. The arc reads coherent but low-pressure, which holds this below elite-level structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → observation → discovery of patterns → active tending → conceptual closure as she departs. Causality is quiet but present (her pattern-seeking with the glass leads to understanding timelines, which leads to changed behavior and a reweighted view of her own craft). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes resistance to change as layered care and carries that insight away, with the oasis altered by another layer of attention. The only brake on a higher score is that stakes and obstacles never seriously threaten failure; tension is intellectual/emotional rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: last petal drops → promise activates → she gathers the kids → they row → they light the lighthouse, accepting that the world will see. Structure is linear and contained to one night with a brief, well-anchored backstory segment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after of hiding vs. visible signal is legible and coherent. The implied future consequences are credible yet underplayed, keeping this just shy of top-tier narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-POV, single-location structure with embedded backstory, and orientation (who/where/what) is solid by the end of the first paragraph. The situational/accumulative drive is coherent: Kael’s growing understanding of the Library’s logic culminates in the cartography wing and the two-world map. Closure lands via a clear conceptual turn when she reframes independence as choosing to remain and chart her own territory. The main structural limitation is that escalation feels more like a gentle gradient of insight than a truly tightened vise, keeping the arc strong but not quite urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: storm → appearance of nest → Mei Lin’s decision to release the letters → villagers’ encounters → Mei Lin and Jun’s closing exchange, all cohering around reconnection. The closure (her redefined role from keeper to releaser/teacher) is on-page and clearly motivated, with an emotional cost in relinquishing the archive she has built for eleven years. Causality is gentle but solid—nothing teleports or resets, and each beat organically widens the frame of impact. The only limitation is that the decisive change comes with little resistance or complication, so the structural turn feels graceful rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → departmental schism → escalating campus unrest → Mara’s risky counter-signal → tricksters’ disruption → temporary victory. Orientation in time, place, and stakes is solid from the outset, and the scene builds in a straight line to the generator’s activation and the abrupt silence. Closure is decisive—the world is different after the broadcast—and the cost is framed (potential damage, danger of amplifying them) even if it never quite bites on-page. The ending’s footsteps and dawn image land as a coherent earned resolution rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: fallow period → access to nexus → organ triggers spatial mutiny → compass reading → tracing the spiral → retrieval of the key. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (she acquires the key and a reconfigured relationship to space) and an immediate cost in bodily and psychological strain. The single-scene structure is tight and appropriately scaled, with no orientation issues. Stakes are modest but coherent, and each beat follows with a clear because/therefore logic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine—Vera arrives at the quarry with a new ribbon fragment, examines it, links it to the bespoke mask-maker, and arrives at a conceptual reframing that leads to her decision to draw—is clean and legible. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal investigation leading to conceptual repricing), and the closure beat (her resolve to paint mercy as a preventative act) is a coherent, on-page reconfiguration. The largest weakness is the sleight-of-hand in the deduction: the leap from threading pattern to “the killer must have made the masks and gone unmasked” feels convenient and under-tested, more essay-logic than grounded detective work. Still, the before/after in her understanding and intention is clear enough to satisfy closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: decoded stanzas → trip to station → nail revelation → new modeling possibility → plan for coded publication. The piece has a legible closure via a conceptual and practical reconfiguration (from silenced research to subversive dissemination), and the “reversible exile is a myth” line grounds constraints. Still, the central problem is re-routed into an off-page future rather than pressured on the page; nothing truly tests or threatens their plan before the ending. The closure is satisfying but somewhat low-friction for a supposedly high-stakes premise.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: hitchhiker vanishes → glass flake image → discovery of scaffold → names → interpretive reframing → decision to witness. Structure is linear and clean, with a satisfying closure beat in the bridge tone and implied “charged poise” of her new role. The cost of that new role is more implied than dramatized, keeping the arc solid but not piercing. Drive lens reads as Accumulative with causal underpinnings and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure—one present scene on the train braided with backstory—remains clear and coherent, with strong anchoring in the first sentence. The causal line from childhood territoriality → startup predation → present attempt to “mark” a different kind of path is clean and culminates in a credible closure: he decides to stay and change his pattern. The cost is quiet but legible: renouncing his default escape into “the next venture” and accepting a period of non-ambitious stasis. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the final repricing of “returning vs repeating” holds under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: Mira’s stalled research → Kove’s entrance with the telegram → shared grief-telling → discovery of multi-star harmonies → redefinition of the inscriptions as collaborative language. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the drive shifts from solitary decoding to shared witnessing, with Kove’s burden repriced on the page. There are small compressive moves (“They worked together then, pooling their observations…”) that flatten potential micro-turns, but they don’t break causality or orientation. The cost—Chen’s death, Kove’s fifteen-year guilt, and the acceptance that translation will take years—is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: failed mirror trick → Kael’s methodical search → vision of the interrupted confession → use of the lie-eating seed → completion of the curse’s logic and its dissolution. The drive lens is Causal and holds throughout, with each step narrowing options and clarifying the nature of the curse. Closure is decisive and on-page: the vortex stops, the trees sink, and the lake reaches an earned stasis that reflects the completed truth. The cost—sacrificing the rare seed and her emotional defenses—lands conceptually, even if it’s underplayed physically.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Acceleration → visions → dream coordinates → meeting Chen → collective maze-building → redefinition of purpose, all within a single anchored scene. The drive lens reads as a Hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise when Mara reframes their role. Orientation is strong from the opening, with who/where/when established early. The main limitation is that the decisive change doesn’t entail an on-page cost or narrowed options; it’s more a confirmation of destiny than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine—past trade → unintended consequence → confrontation → decision to attempt reversal—is clean and easy to follow. Backstory is integrated through concrete anchors (tarot card, orchard symbols), and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she commits to an ethically fraught attempt, with the “before” (confident fixer) clearly reweighted into a humbler stance. The main limitation is that the cost of this decision remains implied and future-facing rather than partially tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: woman arrives with relic → his expertise under pressure post-PBS failure → he must decide how to respond and what to do afterward. Backstory is well-anchored in present stimuli (the cloth, the trailer, the PBS mention) and doesn’t blur orientation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he re-commits to the work with a reweighted understanding of “confidently uncertain,” at the cost of remaining in his hollow quarry life. Escalation is gentle but coherent; nothing important is left dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: present-tense problem (last seed) → recognition of “magnetic gate” → experimental planting → plant’s growth and realization, with clear because/therefore links. The Global Drive Lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative reflection), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of death into transition. The main weakness is that success comes on the first explicit try after her insight, with no on-page failure or complication once she identifies the magnetic gate, which softens felt cost. Still, the before/after of her understanding is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the creel → reading the founder’s pages → performing the smelting ritual → emergence of the scroll and reconfiguration of the world’s problem. Causality is light but legible within an accumulative/lyric lens, and closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: how to live without tomorrow by reframing stability/change and wonder. Cost is mostly conceptual—accepting the permanent loss of “tomorrow” and of fixed knowledge—rather than dramatized as painful, which slightly mutes impact. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and all set-ups (gear, tides, migrating shelves, creel) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: descent → discovery → interpretation → decision → personal ritual, with clear causal linkage. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early, and the piece holds a coherent accumulative/causal lens through to closure. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as Mara redefines the bunker’s status and her own role, with the cost of bending protocol implied but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → descent to bathroom → graffiti-triggered realization → return to river → playing → re-mapping and quiet closure. Causality is coherent and accumulative; the graffiti and the site-specific backstory tighten the emotional stakes rather than digress. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her lifelong project and stance toward guilt in this place. The cost—choosing to feel and stay present at the site of the accident—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Elena arrives with a plan, encounters the Librarian, gains access, finds the library, and in doing so completes a causal time-loop with the letters and documentation. The causal chain (mapping → watch validation → Librarian’s decision → discovery → letter to herself) is legible and satisfying, with closure landing as a conceptual repricing of time and communication. Stakes stay mostly intellectual; there’s little concrete jeopardy or hard choice beyond “enter and devote your life” vs. “turn back,” which slightly flattens escalation. Still, the before/after of Elena’s relation to time and language reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: initial situation, pressure from Kemble, use of prophetic coffee as a decision lens, and a closing stance crystallization that counts as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Causality is solid under a situational/causal hybrid lens: imperial deadline → vision of outcomes → re-interpretation of “authentication” as subversive propagation. Closure lands on Iris’s committed path, with the cost foreshadowed yet not yet paid but still legible. No major orientation or drive-lens issues; the piece stays tightly within one scene-span.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual arc from preparation through release to quiet reset, with all moves logically chained. The accumulative/textural lens is consistent—pressure rises through sensory and conceptual layering rather than discrete plot turns. Closure lands as an earned, quiet stasis/charged poise: another body completed, Kael recommitting to her ongoing vigil with a felt conceptual cost around mortality and memory. The main limitation is the relative absence of on-page difficulty or threatened failure within the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal structure is clean: Mei’s duty is disrupted by the arrival of this specific soul, recognition triggers a crisis, and her choices at the Pool lead to a reconfigured understanding of her purpose. The story maintains a single continuous scene with one reflective band that clearly tilts present choices, and orientation is solid from the outset. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes her entire “afterlife” vocation through this encounter, with the cost of staying with her pain. Nothing vital feels unkept or retroactively patched.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: arrival → request for certainty → moral interrogation → revelation of self-deception and harm → prescriptive next steps → departure. Causality is clean under a situational/causal lens—his hiring her leads directly to confrontation and his reoriented stance, with no stray threads or unkept setups. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Keegan accepts doubt and the cost of owning failure, framed by Mara’s exit and the charged final image of ashes and wind.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally linked, that accumulates pressure through repeated stone-dropping and deepening conversation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration: Maia’s stance toward “vanishing” shifts, with a legible before/after. Keiran’s condition and teaching method are coherently set up and paid off; no orientation or causality gaps. The cost remains somewhat abstract (no immediate external consequence), which keeps this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrowhead arrival → waiting → birds’ descent → reading their pattern → harmonic intervention → quieted arrowhead. Causality is clear under a textural lens, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the pulse learns stillness—is legible and earned. The “three days later” move provides a simple but effective temporal hinge without disorienting. Stakes remain modest and meditative, but the story still achieves a satisfying before/after in the pulse’s state.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ascent framed by brief backstory, building causally from failed exams → keystone → climb → mist walking → restoration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—the world’s rules around “efficiency” are reweighted when the spire reignites and recognizes her. Cost is present but quiet (isolation, the Academy’s likely backlash, relinquishing the institutional measure of success). Escalation is more accumulative than twist-driven, but it coheres under that lens and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: lantern festival → distraction and calm tide → dive using pre-placed anchor → discovery of the library → reading the journal → perceptual shift at the surface. Structure holds as a single continuous episode with one embedded backstory thread, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his quest (from proof to reverent witnessing). The main structural softness is that retrieval of the journals and exit from the wreck are almost frictionless, with no concrete obstacle or reversal in the underwater sequence, so pressure never quite peaks. The ambiguity about whether the experiment caused the sinking is fine, but the story might benefit from one on-page complication tied to that danger.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: a single scene with two frequencies as the main beats and a clear before/after in Kael’s understanding of her role. Causality under an accumulative/situational lens is coherent—coins → chosen frequency → prophecy → revised stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts being a witness/translator rather than controller, with the world’s halting expansion echoing that stance. The main limitation is that costs and consequences remain abstract, so the final turn reads more contemplative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense observatory scene framed around the recent discovery of the recordings, with one reflective shard about the surgery that directly powers the climax. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: observatory → recordings → atlas → naming → crystallization → redefined vocation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing, with visible cost in how her pain is converted into “sharp-edged and solid, painful but present” crystals. Nothing major in causality or orientation wobbles; the arc is contained and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: vanished fish → collapsed cycle → Maren’s dew observations → reconstructed clapper → bell ring → water’s return, all under a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory. Closure is a decisive change plus reconfiguration: the river begins returning and Maren assumes an ongoing custodial role. The main weakness is that success arrives on the first on-page attempt with minimal friction, so the cost at the peak feels more implied than pressed. Nonetheless, the drive lens (causal with a mythic gloss) holds steadily and the ending’s before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain from drought → resurfacing town → photograph trail → bureaucratic order → Mara’s counterproposal → community return is clean and satisfying. Structure holds as a single, coherent arc with a clear before/after in institutional intent toward Valserre. Closure lands via her decisive act and its visible effects, though the professional consequences to her remain gestured at rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: journey through waterfall → search in orchard → encounter with starlings → impulsive spell → realization, all in a single, coherent scene. Causality is solid (seeking the crystal and witnessing the flock lead directly to the experimental act and insight), and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing of her methodology. The ending beat—returning with nothing visible but a transformed understanding—lands clearly. Stakes stay modestly scaled and largely internal, which keeps the arc elegant but prevents a stronger sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is clean early: who she is, where she is, and what’s at stake are promptly established. The causal chain is straightforward—council’s contradictory report → doubt → re-reading patterns → decision about how to respond—and closure lands as Earned Stasis with a visible foreclosed path (escape, capitulation). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible: she chooses potential conflict with the council rather than safe deference. Structure is single-scene and coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line from dojo confrontation → conceptual shift → court decision is clean and legible, with no orientation issues despite the high-concept world. Closure lands as a decisive change (withdrawing opposition, redefining the relationship as brotherhood) with emotional and identity cost. The structure—two anchored scenes plus world glimpses—is efficient and appropriate to length. A more concrete sense of what Kenji is materially risking in the custody battle could have heightened the stakes further, but the core drive and its resolution are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow: mysterious seed → impossible growth → public interest → business salvation → resolved stance about independence. Structure is straightforwardly chronological and closure is explicit, with the corporate threat conceptually answered. The main weakness is that the central problem is solved largely by an external boon (the seed and its viral appeal) rather than hard choices under pressure, so the climax feels somewhat engineered. The mentor twist arrives as an explained reveal rather than a turn that alters options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Emma’s death → calcified household silence → Marcus’s discovery of the tunnel’s properties → his improvised “symphony” → the family’s first crack in silence. Structure is tight and chronological with no orientation problems and one coherent drive lens (causal with textural accumulation). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the house moves from total muteness to fragile, costly re-opening, with Marcus committing to more performances. The main limit is that the plan unfolds without real obstruction or risk; everything works about as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: waiting → noticing the pendant → choosing to wear it → revelation of the true library and a reconfigured role. Causality is sound within the surreal frame, and the ending offers a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost (she remains displaced but now consciously accepts the charge). The story stays within one coherent scene/window and maintains orientation despite the dreamlike time, though the middle leans more on reflection than active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, when), and the structure is clean: reflection on repeated failures → realization about their pattern → decision to break from doctrine and destiny → experiment → result. Causality is tight under a Causal lens: the reinterpretation of failures leads directly to the new method (singing all formulas, using a broken symbol of authority) which produces the vivification. Closure lands as a decisive change plus charged poise: she succeeds and chooses an unmapped future with visible implications. The only limiter is that external resistance is largely off-stage; opposition is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as present-time obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: setup of the fragment and city → methodical listening → methodological shift → discovery → repriced understanding of silence/endings, all in one coherent scene. Causality under the accumulative lens holds—tuning for valleys leads to the “shard of hush,” which reconfigures her entire interpretive framework. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: transmissions become “noise,” the hush the true signal, and the city’s “ending” reframed as beginning. The main limitation is low on-page cost; nothing seriously resists her, so the change is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: the vanished sand / broken time lead to Marcus’s three-year search, to the spectral grotto, to pattern-based radio broadcasting, to the passengers’ reassembly and the harbor’s restoration. The story teaches its rules economically (sideways clocks, dispersed sand as timelines) and pays them off at closure with the hourglass refilling and the ferry completing its route. Closure is decisive and legible: timelines merge, passengers disembark, and Marcus enters an earned new stasis. The main structural limitation is that much of the three-year struggle is summarized rather than stepped through in escalating attempts, which slightly flattens the sense of mounting difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: months of preparation, one focused night’s work, completion of the pattern, and the resulting transformation culminating in contact with the brother-construct. Causality holds under a primarily accumulative/textural lens—each added detail of pattern, vibration, and illusion tightens toward the final “pocket of shared reality.” Closure is solid as a conceptual repricing: Marina gains a new understanding of connection and steps into an altered, shared reality with a visible shift (“Marina stayed there with her brother”). The main limitation is that the cost and ongoing implications of “staying” are only lightly sketched rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: contemplation of the chain link and the Visitors leads into a conversation, which reveals Yael’s decision and lands in a charged final stance about returning with new knowledge. The single continuous scene is easy to orient in time and place, with no causality breaks or confusing ellipses. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—her path is chosen, with implied cost in leaving the benthic life she’s built. The main limitation is that the core decision precedes the scene, so the story tracks justification more than an on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: unusual pulse → investigation → records search → realization of danger → targeted call → rescue and emotional resolution. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (Decisive Change + small Resonant Reconfiguration) when the hearing aid goes silent and joins the archive, establishing a before/after. Some steps feel slightly convenient—the speed/ease of trawling records and the unquestioning acceptance of her lead by police—but they don’t break plausibility at this length. Structure (single scene with past fragments) is tidy and supports the central drive without unnecessary detours.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: a single descent under time pressure, discovery of data, and emergence with a reweighted understanding constitute a coherent arc. Causality is solid (tide windows → descent → monitoring station → realization → retreat), and the closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis around her decision to continue returning with proof. The cost is present but somewhat conceptual; the tide’s early return complicates but never seriously threatens, so the climactic beat feels relatively safe. Still, the before/after in knowledge and commitment is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: waiting for the static to clear → ritual with ink → apparition → reframed understanding → symbolic act with the shard → stopping the count. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of life/death—lands on the page with cost (relinquishing his numerical anchor). Orientation (where, who, when) is established early with no confusion. The piece maintains a single, coherent throughline without stray subplots or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-moment ascent and experiment framed by compact backstory that clarifies stakes, then a conceptual “breakthrough” and quiet resolution. Causal links are coherent (birds → understanding wave patterns → mastery of the diamond), and there’s a clear before/after in her relationship to the stone and the fate of the language. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Keshrin’s death is accepted, but its afterlife in texture is established with a visible personal cost (isolation, feared madness, lack of witnesses). The piece is more accumulative than plot-driven, but within that mode the progression is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: returned villagers → Elena’s investigation → Magda’s garden and phone → Tom’s call establishes rules → mother’s call forces a decisive revaluation. Closure lands via Elena’s explicit decision not to report but to “learn how to metamorphose,” with a clear before/after. The structure is essentially a single, tight scene with one major turn, which suits the length. Some beats—especially the mother’s sudden call—lean on coincidence rather than built-up inevitability, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: her long-term playing → sensing a new melody → discovering the orchard → testing music against the wardens → escalating into the trees’ escape and relocation. Structure is simple but effective, with a clear inciting discovery and a climactic uprooting followed by a brief denouement. Closure is on-page and legible: the orchard is freed and the world’s status quo is altered. The main limitation is that resistance feels relatively easy and risk-light, so the central turn never truly tightens into a pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with early orientation, a clear delivery task, and a closure image that reweights the premise (where broken promises heal). Causality is simple but coherent—Kael must cross the arcade, avoid attention, and meet Mira; the package’s meaning unfolds naturally. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural with light causal scaffolding, and the final paragraph offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn. Stakes are never in doubt, so the closure costs remain conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: a wrong turn leads to the hidden car, methodical repair leads to song, song leads to reanimation, and that experience reconfigures her stance toward silence. The piece operates under an accumulative/textural drive, and the closure—a charged poise where she leaves changed but the carousel continues—feels fully earned. Stakes are modest but coherent: the possibility of recovering not just an artifact but a lost part of herself. There are no orientation or logic slips, and the final image cleanly bookends the wrong turn setup.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from present work → backstory and method → immediate discovery → conceptual revaluation with a clear before/after. Causality is tight at the scale the story chooses (her long project leads to the model; the model reveals voids; the voids force the new understanding). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing that makes her three-year project and her grandmother’s legacy feel different in hindsight. Stakes are modest and mostly intellectual/emotional, which limits the sense of cost but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ferry/library frame → cliff ritual → present-moment shoot → inscription discovery → reconfigured understanding. Causality is intact under a textural lens; each step organically follows Marina’s ongoing practice rather than a plotted twist. The inscription provides a clear closure unit (conceptual repricing of Iris’s “absence”) with an emotional price: she must live with presence-as-light instead of reunion. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, but for this scope the single deepening turn is sufficient and well placed.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the liminal shop, negotiated ritual (wait for the star), disorientation and confession, then re-entry to the world with a new option. Causality holds tightly—the device’s activation and room’s distortion directly precipitate Mara’s breakthrough, and the returned, altered lock of hair reconfigures her next move. Closure lands with a decisive internal change (she will write and reach out to Clara) and a charged final image. The only limitation is that external stakes remain largely implied in the future off-page, keeping the scale mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: past touch → lost memory → lifelong research → return on a specific night with a specific method → recovery and revaluation. The story uses one anchored present scene plus a triggered flashback and lands on a clear conceptual reconfiguration (her life as an unconscious answer to that old choice) with a modest but real cost (decades of seeking, now understood). Escalation is mostly intellectual/emotional rather than situational, and there’s little real risk of failure or interruption once the ritual begins, which keeps the structural tension from feeling truly sharp. Nonetheless, the closure is solid and legible under a causal-leaning accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story holds as a single continuous scene with clean orientation and a coherent arc from plea (“help me go back”) to provisional readiness to return. Causality is sturdy: tea-reading → diagnosis of exile → Miren’s revealed history → extended annotation session → Kael leaving with new tools and stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event, but the before/after is clear and costs (accepting responsibility, strangeness) are legible. The only ceiling is that the escalation is gentle and conceptual rather than sharply plot-turn-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: arrival, setup of the seed and liminal parapet, the essence-weaving process, then a clear closing beat where her task is completed and her future work implied. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each reflection on essence and other gardens feeds into the climactic act of imbuing the seed. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the seed is now more than genetic memory and Esme’s ongoing mission is reweighted. Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual, though; the cost of failure or partial success is gestured at rather than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Mara discovers the net, begins unraveling it, the boy’s appearances escalate toward his confession, and her climactic act with the needle triggers the cascade of knots loosening and his release. The story orients quickly (who/where/what the net does) and sticks to a single scene in continuous time. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy is freed to confront the living brother, and Mara’s situation is the same but heavier, with her ongoing task reweighted by the new silence. A slight limitation is that the hinted “older, colder” presence doesn’t pay off structurally, feeling more like atmospheric foreshadowing than a real plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and legible: commission → analysis of footage → discovery of underlying pattern → recommendation and reframed understanding. Causality is sound, and the accumulative drive toward a conceptual re-seeing of the Chapel lands. Closure comes as a conceptual repricing rather than a decisive external change, but it’s earned and clearly on the page. The cost is mostly implied (risk to mystery and institutional expectations), so the ending is resonant but not piercingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single descent, discovery of the library and comms room, reading the log, then ascent with a reweighted understanding. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens—each concrete find (cylinders, snow globe, log) deepens the emotional and conceptual stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina re-prices her need to “solve” loss and accepts witness as sufficient. The reflective backstory about Eleanor is dense but well-anchored and doesn’t blur the throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: discovery → understanding → action → system activation, ending in a resonant reconfiguration where her voice finally finds an audience. Causality holds—each step grows out of the last—and the closure image is legible and earned. The main limitation is that the central “problem” never faces a concrete test or setback; everything unfolds smoothly once she understands what the ghost wants, so escalation feels gentle rather than tightening. Still, the scene has a coherent before/after and a clear conceptual cost (her and the ghost’s long loneliness reweighted at the end).

    The structure—elevator ascent, diary unfolding, then descent—reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, with a clear before/after in Maren’s understanding of her own importance to Thessaly. Causality is simple but coherent: goggles → revelation of diary → revaluation of Thessaly and of Maren’s grief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, with the final image of clouds “with personalities” reweighted by what we’ve learned. Slightly more on-page implication of how this changes Maren’s future behavior (beyond “begin packing” and “read later”) would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is a clean single scene with interleaved reflection; orientation and timeline are clear from the opening paragraph. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of observation and notation builds toward the decision to present the work as proof and memorial. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: absence is recast as active presence with a conceptual and professional cost. Escalation is subtle and mostly internal, so the arc feels more steady-state than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → discovery of the body → retrieval of the coin → reflective reframe → departure as demolition begins. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: each physical step (finding the journal, the book-safe, the coin, photographing it) justifies the ensuing conceptual deepening. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her work and the guild’s project are newly understood as “sacred, doomed attempts” rather than failures, with the demolition underscoring cost. The only limitation is that the live on-page choice is small and quiet, so the scene never quite feels structurally knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: stranded in luminous dead air → Maren observes anomalies and phrasebook symbols → she tests a reversal based on the hopscotch grid → the ship is released. Orientation is immediate and strong, and the single-scene structure is tight and self-contained. Closure is an on-page decisive change with conceptual repricing (“Someone left us a map”) that reweights the phenomenon and her vocation. The main weakness is that the solution comes on the first attempt with little resistance, so the sense of narrowing options and cost is relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: ascent → search for prophecy → hall of mirrors → vial activation → reframed purpose → descent, with clear because/therefore links. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her role from opener to repairer, and the final image of synchronized gears internalizes that change. Causality is intact and orientation is strong, though external stakes remain low and obstacles minimal, which softens the sense of cost. The prophecy and vial risk feeling slightly convenient since they work on first try without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Mirela senses fracturing → escalates her messaging → resource-sharing improves → surplus draws outside pressure → her climactic message catalyzes a decisive communal choice. The global drive is Causal with a clear Decisive Change: they refuse individual enrichment and choose cooperative trade, allowing Mirela to rest. Cost is legible in the foregone wealth and in how hard-won their trust is, carried from war trauma into this vote. Structure is efficient and cohesive for the length, with no orientation debt or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → confrontation with the pane → decision to plant the lullaby → execution → dissolution. Causality is tight within the lyric mode; each image grows logically from the previous, and her choice to become part of the pattern is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when, what the “clock” and “pane” are) is established early enough and remains consistent. The global drive is textural/accumulative, and that lens holds seamlessly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the nut → realization of blueprint → tactical use to guide the hikers → conceptual revaluation of her role. Orientation is solid early on, and the labyrinth’s rules remain consistent. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: she chooses to remain bound, with an implicit lifetime cost. The structure is straightforward rather than daring, but there are no real causality or closure slips.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the ravine interwoven with backstory that is always anchored to present stimuli (water, foam, chrysalis). Causality is intact—avoiding the place → returning to atone → sensory triggers → scientific and emotional insight → decision to resume the project—under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Closure is solid as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward the work and Daniel’s memory is decisively reweighted with visible cost implied in the hard work ahead. The plot is intentionally quiet, so while it functions well, the turns are more gentle deepening than sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, oriented quickly (who/where/when clear within the opening), with the work session bracketed by the library’s emptiness and the first visitors’ arrival. Causality flows smoothly in an accumulative/textural mode—moonlight reveals incisions, mapping emerges, then the catalog is bottled and hidden beneath ordinary library use. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “place where stories begin” is reframed as the gap between forgetting and remembering, anchored in the final image of the floating library and cloud-sea. Stakes remain quiet and philosophical, so while the closure is clear and satisfying, it doesn’t have maximal narrative bite.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: fortress breach → descent → confrontation with accumulated memories → processing → structural and emotional release. The story uses an accumulative/textural drive, with the tasting sequence as the central escalation and the pavilion’s collapse as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Stakes and closure are tightly tied to the premise; the fortress’s “before/after” is clear. The only limitation is that her success feels almost guaranteed once training is invoked, so the climax never truly threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mira activates the mechanism, begins with universal song, escalates through multilingual inclusion, and then deliberately applies social pressure to draw Elevator Seven into the circle. The piece follows a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear tightening when Seven’s silence becomes the central problem. Closure is strong and on-page: the previously silent silo offers a child’s song, and the others respond in harmony, creating a decisive before/after in community dynamics. Cost is implied (overcoming deep mistrust and trauma) rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: descent → setup of interface → recall of protocol → use of mirror → flood of memories → repurposing decision, all anchored in one scene with legible time and space. The structure reads as Hybrid with an accumulative tilt, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (shifting the tech’s purpose) that does provide closure. However, escalation is mostly internal and explanatory; no concrete obstacle or reversal complicates her plan once she starts. The cost of her new stance is implied more than dramatized, which softens the structural impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the doodle → realization about inversion hour → timed return to grotto → use of thresholds to access the hidden chamber → planting the seeds. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the structure holds as one continuous, coherent mission. Closure lands via a clear decisive change—she successfully plants the seeds of vigilance—and we understand the before/after for the archive’s fate conceptually. The main limitation is the relative ease of success: the piece lacks a sharper turn or obstacle that would make the ending feel harder-won.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: world premise → workshop and sculpture → wiring method → silent performance → conceptual revaluation of “Silence.” Causality within that mode is consistent (her understanding of stress cracks and porcelain leads to the grove’s orchestration), and the final realization that music never died is an on-page Conceptual Repricing with a clear before/after. The cost is legible in her self-wounding intensity and the sheer effort needed to wring “music” from a mute world. It’s elegantly structured, though the lack of a sharper external turn or risk keeps it from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: covenant eclipsed → Katrin volunteers → she tries chess as translation → the beings respond → the covenant is renewed/refined. Structure is tight in a single scene and closure is clear (a successful, reimagined covenant and a new communicative method). However, the resolution comes with little on-page resistance or complication once she begins the chess demonstration; no genuine setback or near-failure tests the premise. The cost is largely conceptual (reimagining the covenant), so the world-scale stakes feel more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the impending fireworks, with a clear causal chain from tuning attempts to emotional realization to the diary opening. The accumulative/textural drive (iterating through different “frequencies of silence”) lands in a resonant reconfiguration when Marcella reframes what Elena protected her from. Closure is strong, though the path to success feels relatively unthreatened—failure or partial failure never feels like a real possibility, which slightly softens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline—seed sought, planted, tended, bloomed, endured, then recontextualized—is clean and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Structure folds years of pursuit into a compact frame without confusion, and the bloom sequence provides a clear focal event. Closure lands on-page as a decisive internal reconfiguration with visible cost (sustained nausea, endurance). The only weakness is a relative lack of complication or setback; the process is hard but almost frictionlessly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: Turning begins → navigate via water into Arch Maze → discover echo chamber → learn of treaty → race to First Orchard → unearth canister → commit to confronting the council. The drive lens is clearly causal and holds through closure, with the hour-long inversion functioning as an effective time-box. Closure is a decisive change (new knowledge and physical proof) plus conceptual repricing (resilience as theft), though the immediate price paid is mostly time pressure rather than a harder sacrifice. Structurally, the single throughline scene with one clean mid-story transition (maze to orchard) feels well-bounded and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → survey → discovery of charts → widened scope → realization of atmospheric collapse and evacuation → reoriented mission. The structure holds to a single scene with escalating revelations and a clear before/after in Mara’s understanding and in the story’s premise. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the disaster redefines itself from structural failure to communal foresight and atmospheric forces, with implications for other cities. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible: the labyrinth is dangerous yet also a hard-won teacher.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear setup (ritual described), live trigger (sculptor’s chisel), and payoff (world’s capacity for wonder unfettered). Causality is solid—his preparatory study leads to precise actions that synchronize with the distant sculptor, and those actions plausibly generate the conceptual outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, wonder is constrained; after, it is released, and the final quiet feels earned. The main limitation is that the cost of success, while implied, is somewhat abstract and mild.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous approach → test → revelation → reoriented mission, all anchored causally to Mira’s actions. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets the threshold’s “collapse” and her role in it, accepting permanent separation. Stakes and cost are legible (no restoration, only witnessing), though pressure remains mostly internal and textural rather than situationally tight. The accumulative pattern of markers, tests, and the final shimmer holds consistently under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: introduction of the vanishing-stars deadline and halo fragment, challenge by Mira, high-stakes experiment (shattering the fragment), and a charged confirmation that the method works. Causality is tight under a hybrid/accumulative lens: because the universe is collapsing and he fears his incompleteness, he pressures the fragment into ink, which in turn produces transposed empathy and reconfigures his stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses to proceed with his own hands under a ticking cosmic clock, with the cost of time and irreversible use of the fragment legible. Stakes stay more conceptual than concrete, which slightly mutes the visceral sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal flow is clean: anxious courier on routine route → uses pendant with farmer → deepened understanding via herbalist → reconfigured sense of vocation. The structure is simple but effective, with two encounters used as hinge beats and a clear before/after in Kessa’s stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, and the cost (living with absence and anxiety while committing to the path) is legible. Stakes remain small-scale and largely internal, which slightly limits structural intensity but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: grief → method from the journal → experiment with frost → prism’s reaction → revaluation of Castellan and reality, all in one continuous scene. Causality holds under a mostly causal lens: her need to test the claim directly generates each next step, and the closure is a clear conceptual shift where her worldview is permanently altered with emotional cost. Backstory is efficiently anchored to concrete present cues (frost, journal, death) and doesn’t derail the scene. The ending lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a quiet but legible before/after divide.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: loss → problem (sickness, distance) → discovery (puzzle edges) → renewed attempt → sacrificial completion. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each step plausibly leading to the next and the closure beat (her essence leaving, bead dimming) fully on-page. The Decisive Change / Earned Stasis at the end is legible and carries cost. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the mythic ellipsis around the magic is consistent rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: bartering memories for the silk → mapping shafts → threading silk → striking the crystal → planetary awakening with explicit personal cost. The structure is a clean single scene with embedded backstory that all feeds directly into the climax rather than stalling it. Closure is a decisive change (planet revived, Kael emptied) rendered on the page, with the bud and his contented collapse making the before/after and its price unmistakable. No orientation or lens ambiguities undermine the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: shard activates → transitions accelerate → discovery of the pocket universe → confrontation with the mother → choice. Causality holds and the multiverse travel reads as a logical progression of increasingly charged crossings, not arbitrary teleportation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Kaia commits to learning to weave worlds, with the costs and paths freshly defined. The legality/backstory info-dump inside the reunion leans expository but does not break motivation or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the backstory of letters, the vanished keeper, and the pattern of stones all funnel into the present-night crisis when the lamp dies and the final letter awaits. Causality holds—her prior choice to answer enables this culminating exchange—and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Vera assumes the guardianship chain with a visible emotional cost. The shift from automated emptiness to a consciously inhabited, tended haunt reads as a clear before/after. Stakes and timeline are legible, with no orientation confusion or broken set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and coherent: one night, one storm, one continuous ritual from anticipation through climax to dawn. Causality is solid at the practical level (ritual → beam → ships’ course), and the accumulative pattern of storms, prophecies, and logging resolves into a conceptual closure around misunderstood work. However, the global drive never tightens beyond “another night done well,” and the prophetic setup (e.g., salvage captain, flying fish) is not paid off in a way that alters options or knowledge by the end. Closure is present but low-cost, more a graceful cadence than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the tea house with brief, well-anchored reflection, and an accumulative drive that culminates in a conceptual re-framing of the heart as gift rather than curse. Causality is modest but intact—her unease leads to reflection, the proprietor’s reveal deepens the pattern, and she makes a quiet decision to continue the work. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, but the cost of her new acceptance remains more inferred than dramatized on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the fallen pin leads to the room, the room to the notes and broken sextant, the sextant to the oak beam and the forest’s memories. The structure is basically linear with one deepening turn—discovering the trees’ wider witness—which yields clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (the labyrinth’s purpose reweighted). Closure is solid and legible; Kael’s work “continues” but with a reconfigured mandate and burden. Stakes remain primarily conceptual/emotional, so the sense of cost, while present, is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: scattered memory, remembered songs, resonance with the mica, arrival of woven dawns, extension to communities, and Elara’s dissolution as cost, with a clear before/after for the world. The structure is effectively accumulative, with one main tightening when the dawn-light must move from trees to people. Some key beats—her journey through settlements and the realm-wide shift—are summarized rather than scened, which slightly blunts immediacy but doesn’t harm closure. The ending delivers a decisive change (realm rekindled, Elara gone) with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—from misdelivered invitation to descent, exploration, and acceptance—is clean, legible, and proportionate to the length. The drive lens reads as Situational: the paradoxical space and society force Eleanor to crystallize a stance toward solitude vs. engagement. Closure lands as a credible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses to live in both worlds, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the structural turn (library chooses her; “you belong here now”) feels slightly pre-ordained, softening the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: discovery of the tea house → impossible bread → interlocutor’s revelation → reconfigured understanding → renewed, specified plan. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the accumulative lens of noticing/erasure → partial restoration is consistent. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big decisive act, but the before/after in Mira’s understanding and intention is legible. The one-scene container fits the scope, though the stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than being tested in a concrete on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: failing library → test the slide → discover integrity of vows → realize preservation is insufficient → transform vows into a transmissible seed → send it ahead and accept the fall. The single-scene structure is tight and the closure (she saves the essence and remains behind) carries a clear before/after along with cost. The drive reads as primarily causal with accumulative lyric support, held consistently. The only ceiling is that external resistance is minimal, so pressure is more conceptual than dramatized through obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: the false-lead scheme sets up the test, the caves-at-dawn clue reveals Kern, and his confession forces Della’s choice. The piece stays in a single continuous scene with efficiently interleaved backstory that always tilts the present. Closure is strong as a resonant reconfiguration: Della abandons her original plan (public exposure via recording) for a mercy-driven hush that still costs her justice. Nothing important is left mechanically unresolved, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: she goes to the bluff to test her skepticism, meets the weather-carriers, receives a challenge from the mist-walker, has an insight, and makes a decisive gesture (giving up the ring and inviting the weather). Causality is mostly implied rather than mechanical, but under an accumulative/textural lens the closure (conceptual repricing of emergent phenomena plus her stance shift) lands solidly. The realization that “everything was emergent” ties back effectively to earlier images (forests, ring, carriers). The ease and speed of the epiphany, with little on-page resistance once the group appears, slightly undercuts structural tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the opening: who she is, where she is, and the immediate problem (missing painting) are clear. The causal chain is straightforward: descent → discovered intrusion → confrontation → offer → choice, with no major logic gaps. Closure as Decisive Change is solid—Maya decides to re-enter the world of “real” art, reconfiguring her life path at visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that complications are relatively low-friction, with little structural surprise beyond the docent’s appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: oasis loss → social dishonesty → Mira’s deterioration → postal fragment → map → journey → Archive → decision to return and spread truth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she gains a concrete place and method for cultivating honesty, with a before/after in her bodily state and social stance. The cost—risking scarce energy and emotional exposure—is present but a bit soft, with little external resistance during the search. Structure (present action interleaved with backstory) is balanced and never disorients.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: climb, preparation, melting performance, aftermath. Causality is simple but intact—the melting ice and shifting sculpture organically generate the music and the gathering. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the symphony has been completed, the crowd changed, Mara at rest. Stakes and cost remain conceptual and low-key, which limits impact under this demanding bar.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic pole shift → overwhelming static and functional freeze → recalled method of containing fears → decision to use fire and mental “boxes” → reconfigured internal state. Structure is linear with one smoothly integrated backstory shard (the child), and orientation is clear from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world remains unstable but the android’s way of relating to its own chaos has decisively changed, with ashes and lost roses as cost. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal backbone with accumulative imagery), held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → key/address discovery → focused courtyard listening → gathered intel about Iris → Iris’s return → mailbox opening → communal reintegration. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph; time and space remain clear, and the story fits a tight single-POV causal track. The closure beat—opening the mailbox and Iris choosing to read, then rejoin the courtyard—lands as a decisive change with emotional cost. The only minor weakness is the convenient timing of Iris’s sudden reappearance just after Maya’s investigation, which leans slightly on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of encoded journals and movement-pattern research culminate in a single ritualized escape on a rare tidal alignment. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph—who she is, where she is, and what she’s doing are all legible. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with a touch of Resonant Reconfiguration: the doors open, she ascends, and the lab is reinterpreted from prison to pattern she has mastered, with a conceptual cost in what she leaves behind. The main limitation is that the opposition (guards/Ministry) never comes onstage, so the escape feels logistically unchallenged once the mechanism is ready.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the beached whale → discovery of pockets → scientific intrusion → Maren’s private experiments → successful retrieval → new ongoing vocation. The structure is essentially linear with one significant deepening (learning to read the coffee grounds), and the closure—her commitment to recovering memories—is legible. However, the cost of this new path is underdeveloped; nothing material or relational is visibly sacrificed or risked. As a result, the ending reads more as an elegant conceptual completion than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious wing → deciphered prophecy → plan to map silence → execution across the night → erasure at the origin → wing disintegrates. Orientation is strong and the single-scene structure with interior excursions holds under a causal lens. However, escalation is conceptually implied more than dramatized; each step of the spell goes as intended, with no resistance or complication. Closure qualifies as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing, but the price is under-articulated, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: sugar → Thursdays → escalating oddities → rooftop confrontation → redefinition of the relationship, all under a coherent causal lens. Backstory about the teas and languages is efficiently embedded and clearly supports the climax. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s understanding of both Dr. Khoury and “speaking buildings” is permanently altered. The only limitation is that the stakes remain largely conceptual and relational, with minimal sense of what might be lost by refusing or accepting this truth beyond implied transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → proposal → experiment → paradigm-shifting realization → decision to begin trials, all causally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing of what “quarantine” means, with a clear before/after in understanding. The main weakness is that the shift from hypothesis to successful demonstration feels almost frictionless, with no serious setback or doubt intervening. Still, the single-scene arc is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a present-moment scene of forging, interleaved with backstory and reflection that consistently returns to the sanctuary and the document. Causality is straightforward—master’s death → council’s request → initial refusal → reconsideration shaped by environment and teaching → completion—and the closure (document finished, thorn embedded, she leaves changed) is legible with cost. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, and that pattern holds to the end. The only limitation is a very soft on-page test of consequences; the political impact is projected rather than felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Maren’s seashell → eavesdropping on the Veshar → discovery of echo people → Kael’s own splitting voice → redefinition of her role. The story compresses crucial middle action (“Over the following nights…”) into summary, which dulls escalation and robs the conspiracy of texture and friction. Closure is present—Kael learns what echo people are and chooses to join them—but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized in a hard choice. Structure is solid but feels like a synopsis of a richer novella rather than a fully pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time ritual in the shrine, intercut with dream reports and the Katerina’s backstory, culminating in Maya’s realization and decision. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: dream fragments → inference of the captain’s choice → plan to recover the data → sensed release of the ghost. The closure beat—ghost’s departure and Maya’s resolve—lands clearly with a legible before/after. The deduction that “you were the captain” and “you went back for the logs” borders on convenient but doesn’t quite break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous night on the parapet, with backstory and future prospect (the student) anchored concretely to present stimuli. The drive lens—accruing images of hidden patterns culminating in a charged poise as Chen prepares to teach—is coherent and stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final return to mending nets, now framed as a deliberate philosophical stance and preparation to transmit her way of seeing, offers a clear before/after. Stakes and costs remain modest but legible within the chosen scale.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival at the orchard → discovery of the box → reconstruction of letters → understanding Project Stillpoint → ethical decision to protect the lie. The structure is linear and contained, with one clear tightening when the memo reveals the stillpoint and another at the recognition that destroying the “cursed” diamond would collapse the orchard. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—Maya chooses to foreclose action and protect the orchard by destroying evidence, reweighting “truth” itself. The only limitation is that external pressure (the survivors’ demands) remains entirely offstage, slightly reducing immediate structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is intelligible: messages arrive → she broadcasts → others respond and polarize → she reinterprets her role at the end. The structure leans on summary time (“As months passed…”) rather than on a single, tightly dramatized turn, which blunts the sense of a pivotal beat. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration when she switches off the transmitter and claims her stance as vessel, but the concrete cost of that act remains mostly conceptual. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal frame with accumulative lyric), and while it holds, escalation feels more told than experienced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single morning in the loft with well-anchored backstory and one clear turn when the combined sounds reveal her larger purpose. Causality is accumulative rather than dramatic—because she restores and listens, she understands; because she understands, she chooses to carry the composite into the world. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of jars in sun after she leaves with “pennies and purpose” marks a before/after with conceptual cost (risking her solitude, accepting responsibility). Stakes are quiet but coherent and fully resolved in this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scene is cleanly structured: discordant ice-song → revelation of shattering risk → confrontation with Kael → tactical pivot to harmonization → aftermath. Causality is coherent under a largely causal lens, and the closure (Kael frozen into the chorus, Maren committing to resonance chambers) delivers a clear before/after. The key’s harmonizing power leans a touch convenient despite the Faroe lighthouse precedent, and the catastrophic stakes mostly remain hypothetical rather than dramatized under time pressure. Even so, the story lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with visible conceptual and personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from years of mapping → exploiting the frozen lake and magnetic viaduct → masked flight → first waypoint is clean and legible. Structure is straightforward single-POV, one main night + dawn shard, culminating in an Earned Stasis / Charged Poise closure where escape has begun but vigilance must continue. The main structural weakness is that all obstacles (the Directorate, scanners) remain offstage, so the climax feels smooth rather than pressured. Still, the before/after is clear and costs are implied in leaving home and carrying risk forward.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—drought ends, body discovered, official cover-up, Sara investigates and decides to challenge the narrative—is clean and easy to follow. Closure lands via a quiet but legible stance shift: she leaves the tunnel determined to let the findings ripple upward despite the implied career cost. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with a clear beginning (descent), middle (evidence gathering and realization), and end (ascent and decision). However, the investigation proceeds almost frictionlessly, with no real on-page obstacles or reversals beyond accumulating clues.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Marcus’s long neglect → seeing Sarah at the prison → seeking Mrs. Chen’s help → plan to deliver the restored heart, with a clear before/after in his stance. Orientation is excellent; we always know where we are, who’s present, and what the temporal window is. Closure lands as a decisive change—he moves from inert regret to concrete intention with a visible future cost (facing Sarah). The main limitation is that the middle lacks a genuine structural complication; everything in the shop unfolds smoothly, so escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with brief, well-anchored backstory, and a clear accumulative drive as the yearning algorithm is explained and then extended to future yearnings. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the final image reveals humanity’s future desire to understand desire itself, reweighting the entire experiment. However, there is minimal on-page cost and almost no structural turning point beyond explanation deepening into reflection. The piece reads more like a polished vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: noticing one disappearance leads to a pattern, then deeper system intrusion, then the discovery of the purgatory cluster and the choice to extract. Structure is largely summary-driven (“She found the pattern on her thirty-seventh day…”) which flattens some beats that could be dramatized, but the story still lands a valid closure (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing) when she commits to extraction. Cost remains mostly implied; there is no on-page complication or pushback from the system or other humans in the final act. Overall very coherent, but not yet at a “flawless” structural tightness or depth of on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure—a single elongated “weighted breath” turning into a charged decision—holds cleanly, with the mirror visions and shard-touching operating as the central causal chain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the leaders’ stance toward each other and their shared past is reweighted, and a path toward peace is chosen at real emotional cost. The drive lens reads as mostly Situational with accumulative/lyric texture; that lens is consistent from setup through the final image. The only limit is that the cost and future difficulty of the peace feel somewhat softened, keeping the impact short of fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: euthanasia premise → months of relief work → rescue of the family → confrontation with appointment email → charged decision to delay without canceling. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each beat deepening her reorientation to death and service rather than producing sharp reversals. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses immediate self-annihilation by choosing to stay through summer while keeping the cost of the pending appointment alive. The only limitation is that concrete external pressures on the choice remain relatively low and could be tightened further for elite-venue impact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: missed bus → isolation at the pavilion → confrontation with the burned letter → decision to stay the night and explore their relationship. Structure is tight—a single continuous scene with one clear arc—and closure lands as a quiet but legible reconfiguration of their options. The felt cost of Elena’s decision (familial rupture, Dimitri) is mostly implied rather than dramatized, which softens the impact. Still, the before/after is clear enough to satisfy closure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: prophet arrives → request is articulated → ritual is demonstrated → the costed consecration lands. Causality is coherent and accumulative; each step of Maya’s ritual deepens commitment and leads naturally to the final weaving of her awareness into the stone. Closure is solid (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): the world now permanently contains the archive, and Maya’s options are irrevocably altered. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete consequence, which keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-time field → arrangement of photos → community arrival → communal decision, all cohering around one stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the town shifts from isolated grief to collective action (mural, garden, documentation), with a clear before/after. Causality is soft but adequate for a textural design: her project leads to viewing, to conversation, to concrete plans. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the drive as accumulative/textural stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single dawn scene framed by tomorrow’s testimony, interwoven with concise backstory about the crystal and the Council. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds evidence and atmosphere toward a charged poise ending where Maren commits to defending her discovery. Causality is coherent, but the decisive change (her resolve) is essentially in place from the opening, so the closure is more affirmation than turn. The cost of that choice is largely conceptual and projected into the future, not materially felt on the page, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wandering/search → recalled mission → following driftwood markers → confrontation with the hum → renunciation of recording. Causality is consistent under the textural lens: Marcus’s forgetting necessitates the driftwood and Sarah’s remembered brief, which in turn enables the ending choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they trade the fantasy of capturing time for a shared, fragile memory, with Marcus’s impending forgetfulness as the cost. A touch more overt external pressure or a concrete obstacle might deepen the felt narrowing of options, but what’s here is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: tremors and the failing clock establish pressure, Mira’s re-engineering is the central turn, and the ending lands as a conceptual repricing of “escape velocity” with a charged final image. Causality is coherent at every step, and the single-scene frame with a brief time jump to “that night” is elegant and legible. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized in consequences, but it is clear that a path of pure control is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: prognosis → Richard’s request → Maya’s recordings and persistent calls → Linda’s arrival → on-page reconciliation → death with reweighted symbol. The piece stays within a single, coherent arc with one dominant stake, and the time limit from the bloodwork frames the urgency effectively. Closure is solidly on the page: father and daughter reunite and his death comes after the decisive change, not instead of it. The only limitation is that some intermediary work (e.g., days of recording) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of mounting obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: deciphered key → hidden chamber → revelation of sleepers → reinterpretation of reality → posed choice at noon. The piece resolves in a strong Charged Poise: the “inevitable noon” deadline and the “return” rune crystallize options and stakes even though the final act is deferred. Some mechanics (“reality’s loop closure,” shadows cast forward through time) are delivered in a slightly expository lump rather than dramatized, softening the impact of the turn. Nonetheless, closure is legible with conceptual cost, and the structure holds as a single escalating scene with backstory woven in.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: substitute body → invitation to the garden → revelation → collaborative bone-constellation → exchange of children. The story delivers closure both in plot (Thomas goes home, another child returns) and in Maren’s reconfigured certainty, though the ease and speed with which she masters reality-altering bone-setting slightly softens the sense of difficulty. Structure is tight, one continuous scene with clear progression and no orientation issues. The cost is mostly emotional and conceptual, present but could be sharpened with a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the present-tense polishing session, woven with memories, builds toward the placing of the white shard and the imagined visitor. Causality is modest but coherent—her past with fire motivates the grotto’s creation and her ongoing practice. Closure functions as an earned stasis/charged poise: she recommits to the ritual with a reweighted sense of offering to others. Stakes and cost stay small and interior, which limits impact at an elite level but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: viral confession → executive’s arrival → silent invitation → pendant exchange → articulated stance on hatred → quiet departure, all in one coherent scene. Causality is tight and legible, with no orientation issues. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the executive leaves slightly reconfigured, and Mira’s ongoing choice to transform hurt into soil is reaffirmed with cost implied by her history. The arc is modest in scale but fully formed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure—one continuous scene with interleaved backstory—reads clean and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. The inciting tension (she can’t find the ending) leads causally to the swimmer’s arrival, which brings a fresh articulation of the thematic question. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: she knows how to end the book and, by extension, how to live with her grief. Cost is visible in the acceptance of no literal reunion and the commitment to an ending defined by recognition instead of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene ritual structure with clear because/therefore causality: research and preparation → aligned dawn → singing through vines → land remembers. Orientation (who/where/when) is firmly established in the opening paragraph, and the accumulative drive is consistent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world is subtly altered and the harvest celebrations gain unknowing depth. The cost, while present (years of effort, fatigue, the narrow window), is more implied than concretely dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrive in the frozen orchard, prepare the pattern, reveal the pulsar connection, transfer and burn the map, exit with a new trajectory. Causality holds and is easy to follow, and the closure beat—destroying the physical map after internalizing it—constitutes a clear reconfiguration of her options and commitment. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but each ritual step logically tightens toward that final act. The cost is emotional rather than plot-driven, yet it is legible on the page and gives the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: she opens the cavern, investigates, decodes the device, activates the echo-harvest, then makes a final decision about its secrecy. Causality within that frame is tight, and the closure—a quiet Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when she reseals the doors—lands with a clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and aesthetic, but the cost of choosing solitude over revelation is legible. Orientation is excellent; time jumps are controlled and always anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: a descent, successive stations, then the deepest point with a conceptual turn from discrete weights to a single tapestry. The accumulative/textural lens is well-handled, with each burden encountered thickening the premise until the merged ancient shame reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she understands that total collection would unweave existence and chooses endurance instead. All beats follow clearly and causally from the premise without orientation debt or loose threads at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure—a single continuous scene framed by the kettle and the changing light, with embedded flashback/reflection—reads clean and deliberate under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is modest but coherent: grief → refusal of photos → discovery of carving method → current carving of laughter → quiet acceptance at the end. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she recommits to this practice, with the shelf and the new figure reweighting what “remaining” means. Reflection is well-anchored in present sensory cues and never blurs where or when we are.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense stasis, deepening reflection, then a closure beat where Kera makes a new choice. The causal thread—carousel stopped → life of scavenging → discovery of the camera wheel → reframing her relationship with her ghost—is legible and coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with a clear before/after in her stance toward her past. The main limitation is the low external pressure; the shift is meaningful but occurs in a fairly low-friction environment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → analysis → plan → permits/volunteers → redirected flows → living terminal, with no serious plausibility breaks. The week of work is compressed into summary, but the montage is clear and supports the accumulative build rather than feeling like outline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of “hope” and the building’s purpose) with a clear before/after. The only ceiling here is that the central turn involves little resistance or visible cost during execution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by concise backstory, leading to a clear before/after stance shift. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: arriving → remembering → playing → reinterpreting her dream. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she consciously chooses a new relationship to music—with cost explicitly named (“She would not become the virtuoso…”). Escalation is subtle and almost entirely internal, so while effective for a quiet piece, it doesn’t quite reach the sharpness or compression of top-tier literary structure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: radio silence → realization of fabrication → boarded barge → sundial → Dessen connection → hold → maps → larger cover-up → new purpose. The structure is linear and coherent, with one main tightening as Marcus moves from personal disappointment to uncovering systemic suppression of truth. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he redefines his vocation with visible cost (abandoning the comfort of legends). The only limitation is the largely off-page opposition; the conspiracy and harbormaster’s complicity remain atmospheric rather than active antagonistic forces.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: rope acquisition → decoding → revelation of the fulgurite method → decision to act and share. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence; the structure is a single continuous scene with interleaved, relevant backstory that never muddies the timeline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Maren’s options expand and her mission gains a concrete, newly understood tool, with a future-plan beat that feels earned. The only limiter is that the main “turn” is conceptual rather than pressured—nothing pushes back, so the cost of the new knowledge remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single, contiguous scene in the garden that moves from meeting to reconfiguration, with backstory folded in via tightly anchored anecdotes. Causality is simple but sound: Marina’s choice to stay leads to meeting Thomas; her methodical descriptive work leads to his reframed self-conception and the living obituary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the island as a chosen exile, his lost craft versus altered loom—clearly articulated. The drive lens is accumulative/textural and holds consistently without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal: acquisition of the egg → hypothesis and apparatus → weeks of experiment → emergence of the creature → confrontation with the father → reweighted world in the final image. Orientation is effortless from the opening paragraph, and the single throughline never wobbles. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world where “nothing sang” now literally and conceptually contains song, with visible cost (a flawed being, a defied father, no real sky). The only modest limitation is the absence of a significant mid-story setback, but for this length and mode the single arc feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous scene at the lagoon with backstory woven in, clearly oriented by the first paragraph. Causality is modest but coherent—Maya brings Marcus, teaches him grafting and the coin’s meaning, which culminates in his smile and her internal reconfiguration around redemption. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the father’s legacy is reweighted through the grafting metaphor and the “scars singing” motif. The limitation is that the global drive is more accumulative than pressurized, so the turn at the end is subtle rather than structurally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: dry fountains → breadcrumbs → Sidereal Patience fountain → time-locked box → unlocking and release. The drive lens is primarily causal with lyric shading, and the closure is a decisive change with visible world-level consequences (water and emotions returning; Mara losing her glow). The explanation of the box’s mechanism via her “realistic imagination” is efficient and avoids over-explaining. Stakes and rules could bear slightly more friction or complication en route to the box, but nothing breaks orientation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: sonar mapping → gear calculation → reflection on past civilizations → decision to seed again, landing in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Causality is coherent, but the decisive “turn” (the gear’s verdict prompting a new seeding) reiterates an ancient pattern rather than narrowing options in this iteration. Closure is present and legible—before/after is essentially “not yet seeded these six” vs “seeds released”—but the cost remains mostly conceptual. The structure is solid for a quiet piece but just shy of elite-level sharpness in its central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—repeated dusks in the greenhouse across the migration—forms a clear accumulative pattern under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each visit layers a new insight, moving from confusion to apprenticeship to transformed practice, and the final unrolling of the ribbon functions as an on-page conceptual repricing of her craft. Causality is clean (questions → lessons → re-seeing old work → new carving approach), and the ending decisively reconfigures meaning with a felt price. Stakes are modest but appropriate to the mode and land coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: climb, ritual, inherited explanation, and a resonant descent that reweights the town’s relationship to grief. Causality is coherent (handle → names → pendulum → town’s loosening), and the closure lands with a clear RR as the burden shifts from object to mechanism and from individual to collective. The flashback to age twelve is brief, well anchored, and enriches present action. The main limitation is that the global drive never tightens beyond a single, smoothly executed ritual, keeping the stakes more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid: the will’s six‑month delay → sovereign case → tapestry fragment → cipher → hidden box → letters → recontextualizing Castellan’s life → Mira’s honoring choice. The piece adheres to a single continuous scene with a clear tightening from puzzle-solving to emotional revelation, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of what “uncharted echoes” means. Stakes are modest but coherent, focused on memory and recognition rather than physical peril. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what Mira risks—emotionally or practically—would push structure into the very high band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is clean and easy to follow: climb → tools → three futures drafted → recommendations → descent. Closure functions as Charged Poise: the futures are now written, the Council will decide, and the colony’s path is suspended between her pages and their choice, with the cost conceptual rather than dramatized. Still, the structural tension is mild; there’s no real complication or reversal to narrow her options as she works, so the beat progression feels more like an elegant report than a pressured decision-chain. The global drive reads as Causal with a conceptual overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, well-oriented scene that layers backstory (the story famine) into the present without derailing momentum. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pirate broadcast, the encoding, and the patrol pass build toward a conceptual closure where dust and memory are reweighted as sites of resistance. Causality is intact (radio → encoding → danger → renewed commitment), with the patrol as the primary tightening. The only limitation at this level is that the closure’s cost remains mostly conceptual and implied rather than dramatized through a consequential turn or forced trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece holds a clean accumulative structure: the slowing rocking chair and fading light ratchet toward Cassius’s death while each reveal (the wife’s mask, the gallery’s function, Mira’s hidden archive) deepens the present moment. Causality is tight—her history with Cassius explains both the ritual burning and her planned betrayal of his philosophy. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: we end with a stable, charged new status quo (the gallery as a secret tomb of “vanished” art). The only thing keeping this shy of flawless is that the external decision at the end is fully aligned with her long-standing behavior, so the before/after shift is more conceptual than decisively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: excavation → discovery of evidence → recognition of its threat to the Council’s narrative → decision to archive and conceal. The structure (descent into ruins → archive → patrol → concealment and ascent) is coherent and delivers a quiet but legible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Stakes are mostly intellectual/social and could be tightened with a more concrete on-page consequence, but the risk of erasure and irrelevance is clearly tied to his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: repeated sessions, the subtractive listening exercise, and progressive integration of voices build toward a quiet reconfiguration rather than a single decisive turn. Causality is sound—referrals lead to sessions, sessions to gradual change, some departures, and a final communal moment—but pressure is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific crises. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s resignation shifts into “possibility,” and the vanishing art is explicitly reframed as listening carried forward. The cost (some students can’t stay; harmony is partial and fragile) is present but understated, which keeps this from feeling structurally maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara returns → plants the seed → tends/prunes → the moons peak → the tree fruits, reconfiguring what’s possible. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow, and the closure—a first fruit gleaming as a charged beginning—is legible and satisfying. Cost is mostly conceptual and off-stage (risk of the Council, burned orchards, secrecy), so the danger never fully crystallizes in-scene. Still, the story delivers a coherent before/after shift in options and stakes for this world.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: storm → blackout → drone failure → beekeeper’s visit and riddle → realization → climb to engineer → system change. Structure is cleanly linear with one primary scene and a brief concluding shard, and the closure—modified drones behaving more like bees—lands on the page. However, Mira’s leap from riddle to “pollen” and from pollen to systemic design critique happens quickly and smoothly, without much resistance or false turn, which softens the sense of hard-won discovery. The cost of the change (logistical, social, or personal) is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a real constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: evening walk → unsettlingly animate house → discovery of systematic displacement → orris-root placement and revelation → conceptual reframe and new intention. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing from “creeping normality” to “creeping memory”—lands clearly. There is a felt before/after in how Maya understands the house and her role. The main limitation is that the stakes and cost of this closure remain gentle, so the structural turn, while elegant, doesn’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the prior revelation prompts the return, the ampoule prompts deeper disclosure, and that leads to the woman’s decision and the statues’ acceptance. Structure is tight—a single, continuous scene with one dominant drive: whether and how the truth of the Submersion will be reclaimed. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and stance crystallization: the woman chooses nuance over a simpler family myth and is inducted as a guardian. A minor limitation is that no beat puts her decision under real temporal or external pressure, so the path feels smooth rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous situation with a clear pattern (climb → experiment → reflect) that culminates in a conceptual rupture. Causality is solid under a situational/accumulative lens—her ongoing proofs and dice trials lead plausibly to the final realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis: understanding the prison’s logic while choosing to continue within it. The only limitation is that external options never seriously reconfigure; pressure stays largely internal rather than structurally tightening in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: present-tense painting, backstory of lost alphabets, then a visionary sequence that culminates in completion of the canvas and a new intention. Causality is clean (job loss → insomnia → night painting → mysterious brush → tonight’s vision → decision to find the giver), and the structure—one night’s work with one reflective band—fits the length. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the finished painting and her decision to sleep and then act reweight the entire project with cost (time, loneliness, obsessive labor). Stakes remain personal and quiet, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: orientation is immediate, and the tour framework provides a clear spine that moves from exposition to a small but real shift when Celeste recruits the woman. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration in the last image of bread and names as defiance. Causality holds (beekeeper’s news → council appointment → this tour → invitation to bake), but the stakes and turns remain low-key, so the felt before/after is subtle rather than striking. Still, the ending cadence lands and conceptually reweights the prior material with the cost of ongoing loss.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: hunger stone → discovery of yoyo → reverse-engineering → insight about time → reassembly → activation and world-click. Structure is linear with one temporal “work through three tide cycles” shard, and closure clearly delivers a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing. The cost of using the device (unmaking his life’s design) is stated, though its concrete implications are left open, which slightly mutes the impact. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the hybrid causal/conceptual drive holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with one backstory shard (the resuscitation) that directly sharpens the present situation, and causality is intact throughout. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: Vera redefines the “curse” and walks out changed, with her new stance visibly inflecting the final image. Because the drive is largely accumulative/textural, escalation happens via layers of realization and object-charging rather than big plot turns, but the pattern is coherent. Costs (loss of fixed self, embracing dissolution) are legible at the end, even if they remain more conceptual than dramatized through external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: ominous, anomalous clouds → interpretation of a coming fractal tide → tactical choice to play matching resonances → survival and post-storm recalibration. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and never slips, and the piece holds a single, clear scene with a simple temporal dilation (three hours of playing) that remains believable. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard survives, but her role and its ongoing cost are reweighted in the final quiet drift. The only structural limitation is the lack of a sharp turning-point beat within the storm itself; escalation is smooth rather than hinging on a decisive mid-crisis shift.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: whistle → shells respond → descent → cracking shells → discovery of the turtles’ routes and the council’s lie → retrieval of the whistles → confrontation of the watchers. The structure fits a single-arc revelation ending in a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s entire existence is reframed as livestock under shepherds. Closure lands with the turtles stopping and the watchers answering, clearly marking a before/after in knowledge and circumstance, with conceptual cost to everyone in Chelone. The main weakness is that resistance or obstruction never meaningfully complicates Mira’s path, so escalation is primarily informational rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: cryptic message → journey to station → discovery of the letter → recognition of the historical falsification → decision to publish at personal cost. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the story stays in a single continuous scene with one dominant drive. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change—her commitment to Chen/independent press and acceptance of career loss—plus a reweighting of the “noble lie” premise. The only limiting factor is that much of the antagonistic force (the Council) remains off-page, keeping some of the structural pressure conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous day framed by the drawbridge, with a clear through-line from arrival to secret note to departure. Causality is simple but coherent—he comes under professional pretext, enacts his true calling, and leaves having deepened that mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: we see his ongoing practice reframed as “archeology of abandoned dreams,” with the future surveyor implied. The drive lens is accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal, but the pattern is taught early and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: past indexing → discovery of letters → alternative hypothesis → using the blackout to access a locked archive → documenting evidence → returning to apparent normalcy with a plan. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: he now knows the sinking was orchestrated and commits to exposing it, with the final image of him quietly cataloging while holding proof. The blackout and approaching footsteps supply a modest tightening, but danger never fully crystallizes into an inescapable dilemma, and the cost of his decision remains off-stage. Structure is otherwise solid and focused in a single arc.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—promise, experimentation, repetition, communalization, diamond crane, illumination—builds cleanly to a resonant final image. Causality is coherent: because grief exceeds paper, she innovates; because others bring grief, the garden grows; because of the thousandth crane, the reconfigured relationship to her daughter’s shadow lands. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward grief shifts from containment attempt to inhabiting a charged, enduring garden. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-tense experiment framed by one well-anchored backstory shard (the wedding and geode) leading to a closure beat where the “awakening” begins. Causality is coherent—readings spike → she identifies a concentration → calculations suggest a critical mass → she chooses to intensify the experiment. Closure lands as a charged poise/early rupture rather than a resolved outcome, but the before/after is legible: the dormant pool begins to coalesce and the world’s options are irreversibly altered. The only limitation is that the narrative leans more on conceptual explanation than dramatized turns, which slightly flattens the structural snap.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival → object presented → investigation → revelation → response, with clear causal links at each step. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph (who, where, when, what she’s doing), and the observatory frame holds throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s understanding of “frequency of belonging” shifts, and she commits to sending a signal back, giving the piece a before/after. The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual/emotional, but it is legible in how her prior rootlessness is reweighted by the discovery of a larger network.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain from Iris’s commission through Clara’s discovery to the terrace confrontation is coherent and well-sequenced. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the carvings, the watch) and clearly reshapes Maren’s understanding, culminating in a decisive change—her choice to finally confess. The structure (search → realization → confrontation → confession) delivers a satisfying closure with emotional cost. There’s no major structural risk-taking, but nothing undercuts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene with clear anchors and a tightly focused central negotiation. Causality is strong: the drawer pull revelation forces the recognition of incomplete truths, which in turn motivates the next-moon pact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they decide to change the terms of engagement with their own governments, not just with each other. The cost—risking careers and national narratives—is legible even though it lies just beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-time scene at the launch bracketed by one coherent backstory thread (storm/fiancé/safer harbor) that directly motivates the current decision. Causality holds: breakup → lingering regret → James’s message → choice to paddle to North inlet, and closure lands with her committing to the crossing. The drive lens reads as largely Situational with causal underpinnings, and the final act constitutes a Decisive Change with clear cost. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and stakes are anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: baseball → encoded newspaper → coordinates → cavern meeting → reframed mission. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “erasure” and “clean slate” mean, with a visible cost in the form of the hard, ongoing path she’s now committed to. Some transitions (especially decoding the clues into coordinates) are glossed over and feel slightly convenient. Still, the structure is coherent, single-lens, and scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal: phoenix → altered world → beasts’ guidance → orchard ritual → transformation → encounter. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, with Mira’s role as a bridge and her acceptance of a new stasis. Stakes and options are legible throughout, though the ritual itself proceeds smoothly without much on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: ascent → ritual → revelation → descent, with each step causally linked to Nadia’s goal. The closure is a clear conceptual repricing: lost time is redefined as accumulating in “negative spaces,” and this new knowledge reconfigures her options. Stakes and throughline remain coherent and legible despite the lyricism. A more palpable on-page decision point in the glade itself (beyond internal realization) would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—preparation, stitching, glimpse of the locked dimension, resistance, then opening—tracks cleanly and delivers a real closure beat as Ren passes through. Causality around the mechanism (stitched grief + compassion + pendant) is understandable if slightly mythic, fitting the mode. The cost is implied (leaving the ship, risking self and reality), though it remains more conceptual than dramatized. Nothing crucial feels missing or retrofitted, but the resistance of the dimension resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from arrival to recognition, anchored clearly in place and time. The accumulative drive—detour → prophecy → planetary alignment → freeing the bugs—builds toward a coherent closure where Maris reinterprets her losses. Causality is soft but intentional, leaning into fate and coincidence without breaking logic. Closure is solidly on-page via her reframing of "transformation's texture" and the image of the freed lights.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → access to courtyard → coded sundial → confirmation of network → implied next phase to save prisoners. Structure is tight, a single coherent scene with well-integrated reflection and a clear Charged Poise ending. However, the “seventy-two hours” clock and the threat to prisoners remain abstract, with no on-page turn where options visibly narrow or a cost is paid; the scene mostly describes an already-secure operation rather than dramatizing a live risk.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: arrival → ritual setup → intensifying visions → pattern activation → conceptual revaluation, all causally linked. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal ritual leading to an accumulative conceptual shift), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost: her work is no longer about understanding alone. Stakes and constraints (frictionless world, risk of losing rocks, time pressure of tides/futures) are present and coherent. The resolution is a touch tidy in how neatly the new purpose crystallizes, but it doesn’t break causality or undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: censored work → storm vigil → envelope → negatives → recommitment, with each step causally motivated and legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the envelope’s “open when you’re ready to see” promise is paid off at the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cartography of scars reframes from subversive documentation to a map toward healing, with the promise of descent “with her photographs” giving a before/after. The main trade-off is that danger and external consequences remain mostly conceptual, keeping the cost from feeling fully on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the needle card invitation → arranged duel → revelation of the sundial code → offer of an amnesty colloquium → Venn’s conditional agreement. The piece lands on a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: Venn’s stance and the city’s options are reweighted without false finality. Cost is more conceptual than felt—no immediate sacrifice is dramatized—so the closure, while satisfying, stops short of fully charged inevitability. Structure holds tightly to a single scene with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-time library scene framed by a precise, functional flashback to the prison letters, and then an earned return to that setup in the final mulch image. Causality is clear—friendship and correspondence → shared project → transformed library/community space → identity decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Solomon forecloses the path of perpetual reinvention by destroying the letters and choosing a name. Stakes are modest but coherent, and there are no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: reel and clock → compasses flicker → portal → arbor performance → return and clock movement → new stance. The two-shard structure (station → arbor → station) is clean and the magical rule about the liminal twilight window is legible and consistent. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis with the clock’s tick and his commitment to his own work. The only limitation is that external obstacles are minimal, so the sense of risk is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is strong: climb to ridge → enter dream-space → diagnose erosion mechanism → plant the seed → feel an immediate, partial shift. The piece adheres to a clear single-POV, single-quest structure and lands a resonant reconfiguration: the world is not saved, but options and stakes are materially reweighted with visible cost (time, uncertainty). The drive lens is primarily causal, with some accumulative texture from the recurring motifs. The only limitation is that the “mission” is predetermined before the opening, so the main choice at closure feels like faithful follow-through rather than a surprising turn.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: compass → Takeshi’s arrival → lace revelation → reframed memory → forgiveness, all within a single anchored scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marisol’s understanding of the “severance” and her relationship to her mother is conceptually repriced at the end, with visible emotional cost. There are no orientation issues and the flashback is clearly cued and purposeful. The structure is slightly tidy, but not mechanically so.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative drive lens works perfectly here; the pressure builds not through plot twists but through the layering of dust and life. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Mara surrenders her intellectual defense mechanism (purity) for a messier truth. The "twenty-eighth day" butterfly serves as a resonant catalyst rather than a convenient fix.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (returning to testify) anchored by a concrete on-page discovery. The causal bridge between observing the frost's retreat and decoding the ledger's gaps is poetic yet structurally rigorous, allowing the drive lens to hold perfectly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (a move toward self-mapping) is a valid conceptual reconfiguration. The structure is somewhat linear and relies on a heavy block of expository backstory in the middle to explain the device, which drags the momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and the Resonant Reconfiguration (library as tomb) lands with conceptual weight. The climax—entering the impossible room—resolves tension somewhat rapidly, feeling more like a realization than a struggle, but the structural integrity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Week by week") rather than dramatized scene work. The resolution—where a single speech unifies a fracturing community instantly—feels unearned and tidy, lacking the friction required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is linear and cohesive, but the resolution arrives without obstruction or cost; the coincidence of the woman seeking a healer who happens to be there feels convenient. Closure is achieved through semantic realization rather than a decisive change paid for by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative trajectory from the initial condition to the transformative closure. The logic of the hyperbolic maze acting as a lens for time is established well enough to earn the metaphysical resolution. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's state is decisively altered with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the "keys in the piano bench" puzzle relies on "escape room" logic that strains suspension of disbelief in a grim dystopian setting. The resolution hinges on a fortuitous coincidence (the specific soldier entering is a sympathizer), which softens the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative pivots elegantly on the redefinition of the central problem—from "collecting absence" to capturing "transformation"—which drives the climax with satisfying intellectual and emotional causality. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration that successfully merges the client’s needs with Mira’s own acceptance of mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident (the new code) effectively drives the scene. However, the "danger" signaled by the roses creates false tension that evaporates without testing the protagonist or exacting a visible cost for her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions as a vignette with low causal pressure; events occur sequentially (observation, work, reflection, conclusion) without forcing a dilemma or meaningful turn. While the ending qualifies as Earned Stasis (persisting in art), the absence of visible cost or a challenge to her solitude makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution relies on an off-page action (contacting prosecutors earlier) revealed via exposition, which deflates the scene's immediate tension. The arrival of the police functions as a deus ex machina that resolves the threat without requiring a fresh, costly decision from the protagonist in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Conceptual Repricing closure, but the epiphany feels delivered by the environment rather than earned through active struggle. The ending is legible, yet the lack of a visible, felt cost or a trade-off reduces the impact of the final realization; the solution arrives because the star fades, not because Maren wrestles a truth from the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative design; the loop structure is taught immediately, and the ice violin serves as the pattern break that crystallizes meaning. The closure (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) lands with the conceptual cost of accepting the loop not as a prison, but as a monastery. The narrative arc is complete and resonant within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible decisive change at closure. However, causality relies on the convenient coincidence of the protagonist discovering the clues and immediately overhearing a full confession. The orientation is solid, but the seamless resolution lacks necessary friction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The resolution relies on a convenient, nearly magical acceleration of growth "overnight" that perfectly times with the Council's arrival. This external validation resolves the central tension too neatly, bypassing the need for a more difficult interpersonal confrontation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery path—setup, interruption, activation, revelation—but lacks a structural turn that imposes cost. The climax relies on immediate acceptance by the authority figure, which deflates tension rather than resolving it through struggle. The closure brings a conceptual shift ("universe reshape itself") but lacks the felt personal or professional price required for a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on "helpful ghost" coincidence—water damage conveniently forming a legible map to the exact spot she stands—which removes agency and tension. Closure is soft; she acquires the prize without paying a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal drive: the fever breaks, leading to the encounter with the illustration, which triggers the realization and the decisive act of recalibration. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of her forecasting philosophy with an acknowledged professional cost (false positives).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    Orientation and closure are legible, but the plot pivots on a convenient coincidence: the crucial radio confession airs at the exact second she finds the valve wheel. This "radio ex machina" resolves the mystery for her, robbing the narrative of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic structure with clear orientation and a legible closure (Earned Stasis), but the absence of causal tension or stakes limits impact. The inciting incident (receiving the stone) leads smoothly to the resolution without complication or risk, making the plot feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the combination of the eclipse and the music magically dissolves years of family dysfunction without visible cost or friction. The narrative follows a linear, teleological path to a foregone conclusion, bypassing the causal complexity required for a genuine reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is a stable vignette that orients the reader well, but the narrative drive relies on information retrieval rather than causal action. The climax is an internal realization (expository summary) rather than a dramatized event or decision, limiting the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is efficient, moving cleanly from the inciting revelation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Margaret recontextualizes her life's work. The central mechanism—intelligence agencies relying on random fortune cookies for decades—requires heavy suspension of disbelief that isn't fully earned by the scene's logic, though the emotional causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure works well within the story's logic. However, the resolution relies on the antagonist instantly capitulating to an argument, which feels slightly abrupt and lacks a "felt" price for the victory beyond physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The situational arc is clean and well-structured, using the dawn window as a natural constraint that forces a coherent process. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a valid form of Earned Stasis—the cycle completes with the cost of exhaustion paid—though the return to "tomorrow" softens the sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the inverted setting grounds the surrealism, but the climax relies on the tablet literally spelling out the thematic lesson. This acts as a Deus Ex Machina that solves the internal struggle externally, undercutting the earned quality of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story operates as a narrative summary or synopsis spanning months ("For months," "spent weeks," "By the time winter") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate causality. This violates the scope default and prevents the reader from experiencing the turning point in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and well-structured, moving from the inciting pressure (shadow/pigeon) to a clear decision (parallel documentation). The ending functions as a Charged Poise, where the stance is crystallized with implied future cost, fitting the length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and complete, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist recontextualizes his grief. The failure of the physical test forces a decisive internal shift that is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a Situational lens, moving efficiently from observation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where reality is redefined. The structure is stable and the orientation is excellent, though the scene remains physically static. The closure lands clearly with the rope image, though the causal pressure leading up to it is intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: arrival, recognition, action, and immediate success. The required closure cost is absent; the protagonist leaves the scene with a smile, having sacrificed nothing of value (the bowl was a found object), making the resolution feel like a "soft reset" rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is linear but effective, utilizing a clear procedure-to-aftermath arc that fits the length well. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, though the final realization of cost relies on summary reflection rather than a dramatized external consequence or distinct action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a catastrophic coincidence—Marlena randomly enters a library for an event and the addressee sits directly beside her—which breaks causality and suspends disbelief. The inciting incident is resolved by luck rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("seventh evening," "weeks," "long nights") rather than a continuous scene, which dilutes causal pressure and immediacy. The closure is a realization ("the search was the point") that feels structurally tidy but lacks an on-page cost or risk to the protagonist's standing.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and satisfying, moving efficiently from observation to investigation to resolution under a Causal/Situational lens. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of what an echo is—lands with precision and clarifies the story's internal logic. The orientation is immediate, effectively grounding the reader in the surreal mechanics of the rooftop world without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is linear and frictionless, lacking a pivotal turn or complication; the ritual succeeds immediately, making the closure feel given by the magic system rather than earned by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident (outage/boy) and a decisive closure (reveal). Orientation is excellent. The structure is linear and effective, though the "object triggers memory triggers change" beat is a standard causal chain that lacks surprise or structural complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene window with a "weeks later" montage that deflates the accumulated tension just as it should peak. The closure relies on a didactic summary of the lesson learned ("finally understood") rather than a dramatized final beat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, gathering objects and then people, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via the exchange. The closure is distinct and earned, though the pre-vision of the basin in her paintings leans on a mystical coincidence that feels slightly convenient compared to the grounded survival mechanics elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the threat into a gift—lands with clarity. However, the inciting mechanism (accumulated magic waking up) is largely coincidental to the scene's immediate action, and the resolution lacks a high-stakes causal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story operates as a narrative summary spanning weeks rather than a dramatized event, violating the scope expectation for short fiction and reducing the plot to a linear synopsis. While the causal chain is logical, the absence of a specific inciting incident and climax played out in real-time robs the narrative of immediacy. The reliance on broad time jumps ("At dawn on the third day," "Maris worked for weeks") prevents the formation of a cohesive narrative present.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure resembles a guided tour rather than a causal plot; obstacles (mist, locked gates) dissolve or open immediately upon encounter without testing the protagonist. Closure is achieved through gift-giving (the map, the truth) rather than active resolution, lacking the required "felt cost" for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Elena’s stance from isolation to connection. However, the reliance on Amit’s journal and the vision to explain the story’s central mystery smooths out the narrative friction; the protagonist discovers the answer rather than earning it through a more complex investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "spatial mutiny" creates a tight, causally driven window that forces a decisive change. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Departure, with the loss of the sanctuary serving as a tangible cost for the pursuit of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is clean, using the "active waiting" to bridge the inciting request and the climax effectively within the scope. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of "transaction" is transformed from illicit trade to honest witness.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, detailing the process of creation from observation to deposition. While the sequence is coherent and the closure (sealing the history in the maze) lands, the lack of causal obstacles or orientation friction makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned against pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story relies on iterative summary ("For months she'd been...") and generalized timeframes rather than dramatized, specific scenes. While the mosaic structure (tides) is legible, the narrative creates a distance that prevents the ending from landing with the weight of an earned, on-page event. The closure is a reaffirmation of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible, paid cost in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, moving from curiosity to experimentation to realization. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of her life's work—lands clearly. The structure is solid, though the breakthrough relies on a somewhat convenient immediate success with the instruments rather than a process of trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on synopsis-style summary ("Three months later") rather than a continuous scene, diffusing tension and breaking the short-story scope defaults. The resolution—a sudden cooperative proposal accepted immediately—feels unearned and lacks the procedural friction required to make the outcome credible.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the countdown, with a satisfying payoff involving the chemical flares. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration—she loses the land but captures its essence. The timeline and causal stakes are well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that functions clearly but fails the "cost" test for closure; the ending is a serene return to stasis without a legible price paid (emotional, relational, or opportunity). The drive lens is situational, but the resolution feels frictionless and lacks the requisite "decisive change" or "reconfiguration" with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative builds cleanly to a Conceptual Repricing where the logic of the watershed is reversed. While the closure is distinct and recontextualizes the setting, the pivot relies on a convenient coincidence—condensation imperfections perfectly matching the lake's currents—which strains the causal lens slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is coherent but lacks a distinct turning point or "felt cost" at closure; the resolution is a return to the status quo achieved through competence, devoid of sacrifice or narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear, and the narrative arc is complete with a decisive release of the prisoner. The resolution, however, hinges on a frictionless technological compatibility, and the temple's collapse serves as a standard trope to tidy up the ending without exacting a personal price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens, using the retreating tide as a ticking clock to force a stance shift. Closure is achieved through Charged Poise: Marcus hasn't spoken yet, but the internal reconfiguration is decisive and the stakes (being disbelieved like his father) are fully loaded. The structure is tight, effectively using the single scene to process past trauma and prepare for future action.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on an "explain-everything" dialogue exchange to resolve the central mystery, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at the climax. The transition from mystery to understanding is achieved through a monologue by the ghost rather than protagonist agency or discovery through action. The closure lands as a conceptual acceptance, but the lack of causal friction makes the structural arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Each night for a month," "Soon others followed") rather than a dramatized scene under pressure. The climax is structurally weak; the council's immediate capitulation dissolves the central conflict without narrative friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (the trees replacing the gnomon) is a satisfying closure that reweights the premise. The transition "Over the following weeks" dissipates the scene's tension, converting potential dramatic struggle into a summary montage, which slightly weakens the immediate causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story functions as a clean procedural vignette with clear orientation and a legible sequence of events, but it lacks a sharp causal turn or significant obstacle. The closure lands as "Earned Stasis"—a continuation of the resistance routine—which works conceptually but lacks a distinct, paid cost on the page to ratchet up the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative drive lens functions beautifully, stacking observations until they click into the "synchronize" realization. Closure is a decisive Charged Poise, shifting her from observer to player with clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Decisive Change) is structurally sound. However, the revelation that the sister also wrote letters acts as a Deus Ex Machina, resolving the central relationship tension via coincidence rather than through the protagonist's confrontation or risk-taking in the real world.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, pivoting smoothly on the recognition of the word "Khlong" to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The "map on the cast" provides a strong causal anchor for the resolution. The cost ("collecting wounds") is present but realized primarily through internal reflection rather than a concrete dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to creation to realization under a Situational lens. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Mira redefines joy as the act of reaching rather than excavating. The cost—impermanence and the erasure of her work by the fog—is well-integrated into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The recursive loop structure is executed with precision, teaching the reader the dream logic early so the ending lands as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration. The ambiguity of "waking" is handled with causal rigor within the story's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story utilizes a summary bridge ("Over the following weeks") that dissipates the tension established in the opening scene, resulting in an outline-like progression. While the ending offers a coherent crystallization of stance (Charged Poise), the lack of on-page obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal/Hybrid line from isolation to connection, anchored by the arrival of the postcard and then Mira. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of planting creates a "close to rest" state that resolves the opening insomnia without a cheap fix. The structure is tight and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal arc is solid, moving from disruption (broken chime) to resolution (new harmony) with a clear investigative middle. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—revaluing brokenness as complexity—but the solution lands somewhat conveniently, lacking a sharp, irreversible cost on the page beyond a philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene follows a clear, functional arc with legible orientation and closure. The transition from estrangement to reconciliation is structurally sound, though the cause-and-effect chain moves with little friction. The ending lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration of their partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a convenient "ancestor ex machina" structure where a complex social conflict is resolved by a hidden engineering puzzle with zero cost. The progression—adhesive analysis to surveyor's chain to hidden valve—follows a linear "video game logic" without genuine setbacks or causal friction. The resolution is symmetric and tidy, dissolving generations of distrust instantly with a mechanical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is excellent; the Decisive Change from hiding to speaking truth lands with a legible, felt cost ("see who comes back"). The inciting incident (the package) cleanly forces the climax under a Causal lens, holding the structure tight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the causal link between analyzing wood grain and decoding a pilot's logbook feels metaphorical rather than earned mechanics. The resolution relies heavily on a "found text" (the mother's note) that explicitly explains the backstory and theme, acting as a convenient key to the mystery rather than a dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a low-stakes linear confirmation of a hypothesis without setbacks or causal twists. The "burnt feather" backstory (fire damage vs. found topside) creates a minor continuity wobble, and the closure lacks a felt cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist accepts witnessing over restoring. However, the plot relies on the temporal swallow as a convenient delivery system for the central answers, reducing protagonist agency in the discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Situation/Accumulation lens, but the causality relies on a "black box" of competence (chaos theory as magic) rather than earned dramatic friction. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration of the scene, but the lack of difficulty creates a "so what?" factor. The orientation and pacing are competent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and cohesive, moving effectively from the establishment of the method (tide dancing) to the acquisition of the tool (the speck) and the final transformation. The closure is a decisive Change of state (becoming a living archive) that feels earned and carries a visible, permanent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path under a Causal lens, culminating in a functional moment of Charged Poise as Samuel prepares to leave. While the orientation and sequence are legible, the plot lacks a pivotal turn or complication; the "event" is a successful rehearsal without unforeseen obstacles, limiting the structural impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story is heavily reflection-led, significantly exceeding the standard allowance for backstory without sufficient present-tense pressure to anchor it. The narrative drive is static; the protagonist walks and remembers, resulting in a lack of urgent causality or active "turning" of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path from experiment to success without a decisive turn or reversal that threatens the outcome. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" (redefining hope), but it arrives as a gift from the magic system without a requisite "felt or conceptual cost" to the protagonist, reading as an unearned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot relies heavily on the "convenient diary" trope, where the protagonist finds a text that explicitly explains the backstory and central mystery without effort. This reduces the narrative arc to a passive scavenger hunt. The closure works as a conceptual realization, but the path to it lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ritual structure provides a solid causal spine, and the closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief. However, the immediate success of the vision feels slightly convenient, lacking a stronger sense of potential failure or on-page cost beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a strong closure unit that reconfigures the conflict from a failed legal framework to a practiced physical commitment. The turn relies on Mirena's specific knowledge of Threll's daughter, which converts a potential coincidence into agency.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully employing an Accumulative drive lens where backstory pressure culminates in a resonant release. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the map is destroyed to purchase a moment of grace—lands effectively. The logic of the "map of cracks" is high-concept and slightly fantastical for the tone, but it operates consistently within the story's established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, but the transition into the magical realm relies on dream logic rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The climax relies on a severe causality break: a prop actively used on stage teleports to a drunk in the back row ("somehow in his hands") without the protagonist noticing. This physical impossibility shatters the scene's logic and renders the pivotal realization unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is executed cleanly, effectively building density through the gathering of wings and the construction of the spiral. The closure (monarchs departing, structure remaining) provides a resonant image that fulfills the "witnessing" premise. The narrative arc is linear and simple, lacking complex causal turns, but it fits the meditative scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, building the process of the ritual successfully. However, the progression is linear and lacks significant causal complications; the "miraculous" alignment of light feels convenient rather than earned by prior spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is frictionless and linear; the solution is handed to the character via an instruction she simply follows. The "storm" introduces a ticking clock that is immediately abandoned when she naps, resolving the tension off-page without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the closure. The pivot—realizing the map's origin is light-years away—is a strong structural beat that recontextualizes the premise effectively. The ending lands with a legible sense of endurance and secret preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on the sanctuary’s magic walls to externalize the memory, effectively solving the internal conflict for the protagonist. This reduces the closure to a passive realization rather than an active, earned decision, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined inciting incident, preparation, and resolution. The closure is definitive (dream captured, plan to bury), effectively employing the "Decisive Change" model. The mechanics of the capture follow a consistent internal logic established by the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the ribbon binding). The orientation is grounded early. However, the obstacle (Lisel's resistance) is overcome with minimal friction, making the causal chain feel slightly predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The loop structure is legible and coherent, but the climax relies on an "epiphany download" (suddenly she understood) triggered by placing the object, rather than active deduction. This bypasses the causal work of the beat, resolving the mystery through magical insight rather than narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The closure is conceptually resonant (the traveler’s loop as an earned stasis), but the narrative arc is flatly linear: problem, consultation of manual, immediate solution. The absence of complications or failed attempts makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative drives efficiently through a Situational lens, using the ritual of storytelling to dismantle the fog's barrier. Closure is decisive: a Resonant Reconfiguration where Isla abandons her search tool (the card) to accept a new ontological status, fulfilling the premise with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot relies on a significant block of expository backstory (the 1847 experiment) to explain the stakes mid-scene, stalling momentum. The resolution depends on a convenient intuitive leap—matching the seal to the rope—that feels unearned by the preceding investigation. Closure is achieved, but the path there lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caves are balanced rather than cured. However, the trajectory is strictly linear (descent, analysis, action, success) with no significant complications or reversals to threaten the outcome, resulting in a vignette feel rather than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (restoring the light) lands effectively. However, the central quest object—the shard of hush—is found in a flashback summary ("three days ago"), which drains the present scene of active discovery or problem-solving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative drive, using the storm's intensification to mirror the protagonist's deepening understanding. The closure lands a legible Conceptual Repricing—shifting the goal from preserving truth to documenting the act of remembering—with a clear intellectual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on convenience, most notably the mosaic pattern "solving itself" to deliver the central theme and solution without protagonist effort. The resolution is unearned; the transition from hopelessness to "eyes wet with recognition" happens instantly upon the fireworks display, lacking causal friction. Closure arrives via a "fix-it" ending where the problem dissolves rather than being reconfigured with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, effectively utilizing a textural lens to move from resistance to acceptance. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist reframes the central conflict using the story's core metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, with excellent orientation and a satisfying closure unit. The causal link between spilling water last month and finding the flower today elevates the resolution from coincidence to earned consequence, rewarding the protagonist's history in the space.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, circular structure that mirrors the transit theme, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where life continues—is valid. However, the progression feels inevitable rather than earned; the conflict is resolved through a standard therapeutic interaction with little doubt or pressure on the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (Earned Stasis) is distinct, but the pivotal turning point relies on coincidence (leaning against a wall causing paint to crack) rather than protagonist agency. This lucky break undercuts the competence established by her lore-keeper status.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible closure unit (burning the phone) that fits the "Situational" lens. However, the progression is linear and lacks a complicating middle beat to test the protagonist's commitment before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative establishes a compelling setup and a strong resonant closure where Maya becomes the physical anchor for the timeline. However, the introduction of the "Presence" serves as an exposition dump that explains the plot mechanics and offers the choice explicitly, robbing the protagonist of the agency of discovery and flattening the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central mechanism—acoustic standing waves arranging dust to point to a hidden button—strains physical credibility, and the convenient discovery of an explanatory deed resolves the mystery with low causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain: discovery, experimentation, mastery, and transformation. Closure is achieved through a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (becoming the weaver of possibility), though the lack of setbacks or failures during the experimentation phase lowers the sense of struggle. The ending effectively recontextualizes the setting from prison to canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "found text" ex machina (the rolled note) to resolve the central mystery. This explanatory document delivers all necessary backstory and motivation (court-martial, intent) without requiring active deduction from the protagonist, lowering the investigative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "mission accomplished" arc where the protagonist succeeds and escapes without incurring a distinct on-page cost. The resolution relies on a highly convenient puzzle solution (the puddle map aligned perfectly by yesterday's rain) that feels contrived rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves solid closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) with the acceptance of the new role. However, the inciting incident is weak ("fog drew her elsewhere" is coincidental/atmospheric), and the central complication is resolved by the grandmother's exposition dump surfacing in memory exactly when needed, rather than through trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery path, but the causality relies on dream logic (prodding a stone creates moss) that lacks setup or grounding rules. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing, but because the protagonist pays no price for this knowledge, the ending feels unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and structurally sound, moving cleanly from discovery to resolution, but the reliance on the admiral's journal to deliver the climax via exposition ("explain-everything ending") deflates tension. The closure—a Renunciation where she chooses to leave the mystery intact—is conceptually strong (Conceptual Repricing) but feels emotionally inexpensive because the alternative (exposing it) was never established as a tempting or dangerous option.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure where the ritual succeeds without unexpected complication or resistance. While the sacrifice of the ring provides a "felt cost" for the Decisive Change, the lack of causal friction makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal line—problem, method, application, resolution—but the solution (showing the tooth) works instantly without complication or backfire. The closure brings a Resonant Reconfiguration of the harp's flaw into a virtue, but the lack of resistance from the antagonist renders the victory low-cost and somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure effectively uses the trauma surges as beats to escalate pressure toward the epiphany. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—accepting the incompleteness of the math—with the felt cost of enduring the pain to reach that understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on convenience; the acquisition of the lens is resolved by coincidence (a friendly vendor) rather than effort or cost. The Guild is a declared antagonist that never exerts pressure on the page, and the closure assumes a bureaucratic victory ("drafting her presentation") without earning it through a tested climax.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience, as the ghost simply points to the solution, rendering the protagonist's detective skills largely irrelevant. The closure is tidy but unearned, lacking the "felt cost" required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure lands effectively, but the resolution relies on a pre-prepared item (the vial) rather than an evolving tactic or painful choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, gathering sensory details and historical context toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's understanding. Orientation is immediate and stable. The closure lands well, recontextualizing the academic dispute as a shared cross-species sorrow, though the external conflict with Keraine remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a linear procedural arc (diagnosis, application of magic, success) with no meaningful reversal or complication. The closure acts as a soft reset where the problem is solved perfectly without the "felt or conceptual cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc with a distinct closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) where Mara reframes her relationship to mystery. The orientation is stable, but the "hinged awakening" section halts the scene's momentum to deliver exposition, creating a didactic beat that momentarily disrupts the causal flow.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, with a clear inciting incident (storm). However, the plot relies heavily on the coincidence of finding a "magic key" (the slide) that conveniently solves both the survival and artistic problems, weakening the causal chain and reducing the cost of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.3)
    The timeline contains a significant orientation error: Marina claimed the studio "three months ago" (July) yet has watched it transform since "late February," creating a logical impossibility. Additionally, the climax relies on the coincidence of sunlight hitting a window at a specific, never-before-seen angle, solving the central problem via luck rather than causality.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight, effectively using the diary to bridge two timelines with clear causality. The closure is a valid Decisive Change that alters Maya's professional stance, earning the shift through the visceral middle scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the resolution relies on a convenient soft-magic mechanism (pressing the bottle to the forehead) that dissolves the central obstacle without difficulty. The closure brings a decided change, but the lack of a clearly dramatized cost for the magic makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from the inciting silence to a clear resolution via the testing of the prophecy. The pivot relies on a convenient memory ("third grade, Mrs. Kowalski's class") that functions somewhat as a *deus ex memoria* to solve the riddle, which softens the causal rigor, but the closure—placing the offering and accepting transition—lands with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    A flawless causal arc where the sensory realization of time's "wrong" texture forces a decisive closure. The ending is a Resonant Reconfiguration that clearly prioritizes earned future over borrowed past, with the cost of the lost collection felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident and climax. However, the resolution relies on a slightly convenient seamless cooperation from the sanctuary inhabitants ("moved as one organism"), which bypasses the potential friction of a sudden protocol change.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative structure is legible, but the closure relies on a tidy epiphany ("cracks let the light through") without visible cost or sacrifice. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the realization arrives too easily, functioning as a "soft reset" that resolves the character's internal struggle without meaningful pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from discovery to observation to resolution with clear orientation throughout. While the puzzle solution (watching the ghost's walking pattern) is a somewhat standard trope, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas accepts the burden of memory—lands with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything ending" where a hologram explicitly resolves the central mystery and thematic conflict via monologue. Closure is achieved through information dump rather than dramatic action or realization with felt cost, weakening the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, but the climax relies on the coincidental snapping of the kite string rather than protagonist agency. The timing of the snap is too convenient, doing the heavy lifting for the character's internal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    The structure reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully realized story, violating the single-scene expectation without a functional mosaic alternative. The "and-then" sequencing lacks causal tension; the problem is identified and solved with procedural ease ("within days... cracks stopped spreading"), leading to a mechanically tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, effectively utilizing the "pilgrimage" concept to frame a single scene that resolves a backstory hypothesis. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, shifting the definition of homecoming from place to time/chemistry. The causal leap regarding "quantum-printed" footprints borders on a soft magic reset, but the thematic groundwork makes it legible as a conceptual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, stacking specific planting actions toward a resonant closure where the owl's call reconfigures the silence. The pacing is smooth—perhaps too smooth—but the orientation is immediate and the final conceptual repricing of the battlefield lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is linear but relies on significant convenience—Finder happens to have the exact wax-preserved leaf needed to solve the riddle on her shelf. The narrative summary ("The journey took three days") glosses over the actual physical cost of the transition, reducing the climax to a low-stakes reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the sketching process to a Conceptual Repricing of her isolation. Closure lands securely with the acceptance of her severed timeline, though the pacing feels a bit linear and essayistic in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure with low causal friction; the protagonist arrives with the exact tools needed and receives a magical map that solves the central puzzle for her. Closure is a symmetric restoration of the status quo ("shadow had returned") without a legible personal cost or sacrifice. The resolution feels procedural rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is distinct and accumulative, moving effectively from chaotic survival to the crystallization of a new purpose. The middle section relies on summary ("She developed her method over weeks") which slightly flattens the pressure, but the final scene with the colleague provides the necessary scenic anchor for closure. The ending is a strong Conceptual Repricing of her life's work.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc hinges on a deus ex machina: the crow's feather conveniently falls to solve the central linguistic puzzle without protagonist effort. While the setup and resolution are clear, the reliance on a lucky coincidence to *resolve* (rather than complicate) the plot undermines the causal drive and satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure follows a linear "instruction manual" pattern: the tapestry explicitly provides the directions, and the protagonist obeys them to achieve the resolution. While the closure (unfreezing) is legible, the lack of causal complications or failed attempts makes the trajectory predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight causal loop where the protagonist’s specific counter-move (poetry) directly triggers the realization (amplification vs. refraction) that resolves the plot. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the final walk toward the spire signals acceptance with undeniable cost. The drive lens remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    The plot moves efficiently, but the central breakthrough relies on the cliché "Understanding struck like lightning," which bypasses the satisfaction of watching Mira deduce the pattern through trial. The resolution, where the statue physically holds back the sea via "dire enchantment," leans heavily on magical convenience rather than a strictly causal mechanism established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing the "wrong turn" coincidence effectively to force a confrontation with the core theme. The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist alters her approach to life and art with visible cost. The pacing moves smoothly from the inciting shell arrival to the cave epiphany, though the transition relies somewhat on the convenience of the discovered chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a prop resolves the central conflict, resulting in a convenient rather than earned resolution. While the orientation is clear, the causality relies on the vial's supernatural influence to bypass the necessary friction of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative loop is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) works within the accumulative lens. However, the setup regarding "weak signals" and "waning crescent" creates an expectation of difficulty that the smooth, immediate success of the phone call undercuts, making the initial tension feel like false suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and the inciting incident drives directly to the resolution with strong closure. However, the convenience of possessing the specific textbook needed to decode the rare artifact softens the causal difficulty; the solution feels somewhat "pre-packed."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on an expository flashback to resolve the central mystery. The flower functions as a device that delivers a comprehensive explanation (backstory, technology, motive) in a single block, which undercuts the causal tension of the investigation. The closure is clean, but the path to it feels expedited by this convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear causal chain from the inciting incident (ants) to the climax (door). Orientation is strong, and the closure (opening the door) is a distinct Decisive Change, though the resolution's "infinite directions" image is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal path with strong orientation. The "ember grotto" serves as an effective micro-turn that tests the protagonist's resolve before the climax. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "why" is delivered via dialogue rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the causal link at the climax is weak; the resolution relies on a "lucky inventory" reveal where Mira happens to have crafted the perfect spheres before knowing Kael's specific need. This turns the climax into a validation of coincidence rather than a solution generated by the scene's unique pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative operates effectively under an Accumulative lens, stacking shards of temporal confusion to build pressure toward the crystallization of "Theory 47." The disorientation is handled with skill, anchoring the reader in the cabin even as the timeline splinters. Closure lands as a resonant Earned Stasis, where the act of documenting becomes a defiant, if futile, constant against the chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the causality relies on a convenient thematic alignment between the medical tool and the protagonist's specific crisis, making the resolution feel slightly constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal arc with a legible Decisive Change where the protagonist rejects the standard test for a personal truth. The "breath between storms" concept structures the pacing effectively. Closure is earned, though the mentor's immediate and total validation feels slightly too tidy, reducing the lingering tension of the risk taken.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scene follows a clean Situational/Accumulative arc with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure—a "charged poise" where forgiveness is withheld but presence is accepted—feels earned and final without being tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story executes a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR) closure; abandoning the dictionary provides a tangible, visible anchor for the internal shift. The circular structure—opening and closing with the "hiccup"—effectively teaches the spiral logic required to understand the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence, but the connection between the "counting backwards" idea and the sudden decision to insert the key into the floor is tenuous. The key fitting perfectly resolves the mechanical tension too easily, relying on a magical "lock-and-key" trope that simplifies the philosophical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (letting Marcus go) constitutes a Decisive Change. However, the resolution hinges on a coincidence (the intruder happens to be someone she sees daily) which weakens the causal integrity. The cost—risking the entire operation—is stated but feels abstract at the moment of decision, as the consequences are easily evaded.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving from the inciting discovery of the notebooks to a clear Conceptual Repricing in the syllabus drafting. The closure is earned and intellectually satisfying, anchoring the abstract math in a concrete, forward-looking action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on a montage of summaries rather than a causal chain of scenes; the "pattern" is clear, but the lack of resistance makes the plot feel like a list of successes. The ending is a thematic restatement ("The loop was endless") rather than a dramatic closure unit that reconfigures the protagonist's stakes or options.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story functions as a reflective vignette where the inciting incident (locket arrival) occurs off-page, leaving the scene with low causal tension. The closure—a shift in perspective—feels inevitable and low-stakes because the transformation is processed internally rather than earned through an external struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scene is structurally sound with excellent orientation and a clear causal chain leading to the climax. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist drops her defense mechanism, though the "cost" of vulnerability is stated more than felt. The narrative arc is efficient, but the resolution feels slightly teleological, tidily solving the central conflict with a perfectly timed realization.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, with a clear trajectory from seeking to finding. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path from A to B is linear and lacks significant obstacles or causal turns that would heighten the sense of earned achievement. The "cost" is largely abstract effort rather than a specific price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the central problem (starving colonists/wrong seeds) is intellectualized away without a felt cost. The resolution—settlers finding "comfort" in multiple timelines—dissolves the stakes rather than confronting them, resulting in a low-consequence ending that strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, moving from a state of blockage to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview. However, the progression is linear and lacks causal friction; Marina accepts the lesson with minimal pushback, making the closure feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, effectively using the "arsonist" backstory to charge the present discovery with meaning. The causal link between the defaced portrait and the decision to upload provides a clear Decisive Change. However, the narrative relies on significant summary bridges ("spent two years," "worked through the night") that smooth over the friction of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Accumulative arc functions clearly, building density until the dawn breaks. However, the closure is soft; the "return to the waking world" is a standard reset without a decisive turn or irreversible change in stance. The narrative arc feels linear and safe, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is logical, but the climax suffers from a visualization gap: Voss "makes the arrest" after finding only data servers, implying an unseen character whose presence was never established. This phantom actor blurs the resolution of the physical threat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    The plot hinges on a moral test where the guardian withholds life-saving coordinates until a confession is made, creating a troubling logic gap regarding the brother's safety. The ending relies on summary ("Later, when they found...") rather than dramatized rescue, softening the climax. Closure is achieved but relies on fable logic rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a smooth, fable-like trajectory where the solution (window displays) immediately resolves the problem without setbacks or complications. The closure is a "soft reset" that cures the children’s silence without exacting a visible price or requiring a difficult trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is legible as a Decisive Change (release of the object), but the inciting incident (finding the bone) and the climax (whale appearing) rely heavily on coincidence rather than causal progression. The "suddenly understood" realization is an internal epiphany triggered by external luck rather than rising pressure forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative drive (whittling wood -> whittling self -> destroying the bouquet) creates a coherent, potent structure. Closure is decisive and costly, marking a shift from performance to presence. The score is capped just below 9.0 because the final sentence ("...permission to feel") slightly over-explains the resonance of the empty wall.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative structure, building resonance to a Conceptual Repricing closure ("boundaries... were never real"). However, the lack of significant obstacles—the ban is already lifted, the atrium welcomes her—robs the closure of earned weight or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving efficiently from the plant arrangement to the final barter. The closure functions as a valid Conceptual Repricing of "perfection," though the "bartered awakenings" concept feels slightly explanatory rather than an organic, high-stakes trade. Orientation and causal linkage are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the corrupted data) is legible. However, the progression is linear and lacks resistance; the antagonist (corruption) is instantly converted into an asset by the stranger’s competence, removing causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear "process" arc that mirrors the internal thematic reflection, satisfying the Accumulative lens. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the lack of an orientation-shifting obstacle makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The pacing is steady, though the "rock bottom" reflection momentarily halts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure successfully builds to a Conceptual Repricing of "magic as mechanics." While the middle section leans heavily on summary and exposition to explain the backstory, the closure lands with a coherent retrospective shift in meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal, moving efficiently from entry to interaction to realization and finally to closure. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, and the ending delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation of the goal). The pacing is rapid, effectively a single scene, but the causal chain holds firmly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure fits the vignette style, and the closure—an "Earned Stasis" where she reaffirms reality via the stone—lands with legible conceptual weight. However, the plot relies heavily on watching a recording rather than present-action pressure, limiting dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal, moving from the inciting reflection to a specific trigger (the shedding) and a decisive closure (writing the report). The cost of the decision—loss of career stability and funding—is made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, using the coffee ring divination to bridge the backstory and the present crisis. Closure is a distinct Conceptual Repricing where Maya accepts the "sideways" nature of her gift, though the divination mechanic provides a slightly convenient shortcut to the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear arc from discovery to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the stored love is released. The progression is logical and the conceptual repricing (from hoarding to sharing) lands effectively, though the story lacks significant structural torque or obstacles to complicate the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible and causally linked: the screaming words trigger the ritual, the specific method (tracing stars) yields the result, and the closure (release/rest) logically follows. The pacing is steady, though the linear progression from instruction to success feels low-risk until the final cost is paid. The ending serves as a clear Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accesses new knowledge to recontextualize the world's potential. The causal link between singing and quantum collapse is established early and paid off, though the logic is "soft" magic. The narrative arc is linear and cohesive, fulfilling the promise of the inciting setup.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of discovery without causal friction; the protagonist finds a key, uses it, and succeeds immediately. The closure relies on a "dream logic" reset where the insight is granted rather than won, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to anchor the final Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure (collecting stamps) that lacks dramatic reversals or causal density. The climax is a realized epiphany ("courage was there all along") handed to the protagonist by external figures, missing the tension of an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative arc is well-paced, building from the discovery of the bolt to the final act of singing. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the refusal to leave and the act of creating sound recontextualize the setting's oppression. The "ash marks" on a staircase surviving foot traffic rely on a "preserved somehow" hand-wave that slightly strains physical credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure relies on a POV breach to validatethe protagonist's success ("Orian read... and understood"), shifting the climax off-stage and resolving the conflict via summary rather than dramatized consequence within the scene. The causality of the rune unseating the king is asserted rather than demonstrated, weakening the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a specific mystery (missing whales) to a profound Conceptual Repricing of what "recovery" means. The use of the atlas as a pivot point is convenient but earned by the setting's history, and the closure lands with the weight of a paradigm shift rather than just a plot solution.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a coherent vignette, but the closure relies on a convenient epiphany—ancient stones providing a mystical solution to a political problem—without visible cost. The resolution (planning to bring others to hum) feels conceptually light given the "gritty rebellion" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative builds a clear bridge from discovery to resolution, landing a decisive closure beat. The middle section, however, compresses the decoding process into summary ("Lira spent three days..."), bypassing the dramatic struggle required to earn the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is solid, effectively utilizing a single scene to dramatize a cycle of trigger and recovery. The closure—an Earned Stasis where Layla regains composure—lands clearly, though the backstory and explanatory blocks in the first half slow the initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on dream logic where physical threats (walls closing) are resolved by abstract manipulation (arranging cards) without established rules, weakening causality. While the ending offers Conceptual Repricing, the "cost" of embracing brokenness feels like a convenient relief rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from tracking to discovery to reconfiguration of the goal. The drone footage is a slightly convenient device to bridge the gap between "spilled ink" and "teleportation," but the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's mission—lands effectively with the cost of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from inciting incident to action, and the closure (pressing transmit) is a valid Decisive Change. However, the logic relies on a significant intuitive leap—she instantly deduces a living conspiracy from a frost pattern—which feels like a plot patch. The lack of on-page obstacles makes the trajectory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change (the father joining the planting) and legible cost (renouncing his trade). The causal pivot—sheathing the knife—relies heavily on the atmospheric pressure of the dome rather than active character friction, but fits the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal arc is clean and linear: the celestial event provides the opportunity, the specific tool/method secures the prize, and the resolution follows logically. The orientation is immediate and effective. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the captured sound transforms the daughter's silence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and efficient, moving from the inciting phone call to the logical pivot and final decision without wasted motion. The closure is a clear Decisive Change with acknowledged cost (family credibility). The orientation is immediate, and the "proof by contradiction" serves as an excellent structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and resolution, but the logic underlying the backstory is muddy; the discrepancy between the letter's text and Mira's conclusion requires an unearned leap of faith. The closure lands via the tattooing ritual (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the path there is smoothed over by abstract summaries rather than causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure where the tile is integrated. The concept of "unlearning" frames the arc well, though the coincidence of the woman's arrival simplifies the plot progression.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is exemplary, moving efficiently from the inciting discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical removal of the tessera anchors the moral choice. The cost is tangible and felt—the weight of the secret she must carry—satisfying the highest standards for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure, but the resolution relies on a magic-fix ("The garden responded") without generating causal friction or demanding a price. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the problem is solved perfectly by the protagonist's unchecked ability—rather than a closure earned through struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure reconfigures the central loss into a new form of understanding (Conceptual Repricing). However, the middle section relies on a "montage" summary ("For three weeks, they worked") that bypasses the struggle, and Dr. Chen's immediate validation removes necessary external friction, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from mapping to broadcasting. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing of her role. Orientation is established well, though the progression feels linear and lacks a moment of significant causal friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("She spent the next three days...") to skip the actual work of decoding, deflating the rising action. The causal link between sorting buttons and unscrambling audio is metaphorical rather than mechanical or magical-logic consistent, functioning as a soft magic solution that bypasses complexity. Closure is achieved, but it feels inevitable and frictionless rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid with a clear decisive change at the closure. However, the central mechanism—Marcus manipulating wind patterns to form specific grid coordinates in snow drifts—strains credibility even for the genre, creating a "magical" causality that fits poorly with the grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a fable-like pathetic fallacy where the weather conveniently clears the moment internal understanding is reached, bypassing causal struggle. While the "rain gutter" clock offers a structural frame, the resolution dissolves the obstacle rather than conquering it.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively, offering a clear before/after state regarding the character's understanding of the world. The structure is linear and relies on a standard "rule of three" discovery (beekeeper, bees, empty) which feels slightly formulaic. The causal link between her actions (watering) and the "thrumming" outcome is legible but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands a legible resonant reconfiguration with the lighthouse image. The structure is linear and effective, though the causality is driven by a self-imposed promise rather than external pressure, making the progression feel somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving clearly from the sundial’s prompt to the map room realization. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "because/therefore" chain relies heavily on the sundial’s convenient direction rather than protagonist agency in the opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative momentum stalls in the middle with a summary montage of anonymous visitors, which dissipates the immediate scene tension between Mei Lin and Jun. This shift from dramatized interaction to generalized summary weakens the causal link between the protagonist's action and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution arc that relies on the convenient timing of Jupiter's alignment to function. The closure is a "clean sweep" victory where the antagonist simply switches off, lacking the felt cost or complication expected in literary fiction. The resolution feels too easy given the established apocalyptic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the narrative achieves clear closure with the retrieval of the key, the pivotal turn relies on a coincidence—the organ playing exactly when needed—which diminishes protagonist agency. The resolution feels reactive; Mara observes the external change and follows it, rather than driving the solution herself.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a significant unearned knowledge leap: identifying a specific 20-year-old workshop and its history solely from a ribbon found in a quarry. This convenient epiphany resolves the mystery without procedural causality, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a "magic object" logic where a 2019 nail solves a future chaotic system via microscopic etching, which strains causality. The closure (publishing via poetry) is a distinct change, but the path there feels frictionless and relies heavily on the prop rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and the orientation is solid, moving efficiently from the inciting mystery to the discovery. The structure, however, is essentially a linear discovery tour with minimal complications; the realization relies on a heavy expository monologue to connect the dots rather than dramatized action. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of resistance prior to the epiphany softens the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure unit (Earned Stasis) lands clearly with Luka's decision to stay, satisfying the Accumulative lens. However, the causal pivot relies on a cliché interaction with a fox to spark the realization, making the turning point feel coincidental and aesthetic rather than forced by accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central deduction—that the inscriptions require simultaneous observation—is a thematic convenience rather than a logical outgrowth of the clues provided. Closure arrives via a "soft reset" where the obstacle (isolation) dissolves immediately upon collaboration, lacking a felt cost in the present timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is tight and the causal chain of investigation is logical, leading to a satisfying conceptual breakthrough. However, the resolution relies on a "flesh-eating plant seed" introduced only in the final moments (the "pouch ex machina"), which solves the external conflict without prior establishment. This lack of setup for the decisive tool undercuts the structural integrity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of arrival and agreement without causal complications or meaningful obstacles. The closure—a realization that they are guides—feels like a foregone conclusion driven by the premise rather than a hard-won consequence of on-page actions or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from consequence to decision, though the opening relies heavily on reflective summary while walking. The closure (a Decisive Change to attempt the fix) lands effectively, earning the shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight and causal, with a clear inciting incident (the cloth) challenging the protagonist's status quo (hiding in facts). Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final action of tacking up the cloth and resuming work signifies a shift in stance from avoidance to engagement with uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural path, but the closure leans on a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where the solution (planting in the magnetic center) instantly resolves the conflict with perfect success. The realization of the "magnetic gate" feels like a convenient coincidence of terminology rather than an earned causal breakthrough, and the ending lacks a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot relies on a significant convenience—finding the crucial creel "exactly where the dream had suggested"—which shortcuts investigation and undermines causality. The narrative follows a linear procedural (find, read, smelt) without genuine obstacles or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear and orientation is solid. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (altering the report, joining the ritual), though the reliance on a "journal that explains everything" is a convenient structural shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) is distinct and effective, with the accordion playing serving as a strong decisive action. However, the pivot relies heavily on the "bathroom wisdom" acting as a convenient catalyst, which simplifies the causal chain for such a deep trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal loop structure (bootstrap paradox) is executed well, creating a satisfying click of closure when the protagonist realizes she must write the letter. However, the final temporal logic ("wrote the letter she would send herself three days ago") is syntactically ambiguous—unclear if she is sending it to the past or if the library's reversed time places her there—which creates a momentary hitch in clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight and effective, moving from the inciting incident (authentication deadline) to a clear climax (sketching the blueprints). Closure is excellent: a Decisive Change where Iris sacrifices her safety to free the music, satisfying the "Causal" lens with visible cost (exile). The pacing supports the weight of the decision within the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—a "day in the life" vignette—that lacks a complication or decisive turn to test the protagonist. While the closure is legible (the release of the body), it relies on a routine completion of tasks rather than a reconfigured stance or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—a reaffirmation of purpose—is legible. However, the inciting incident (arrival of the murderer) resolves too smoothly due to the protagonist's pre-established state, lacking a sense of causal risk before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, fulfilling the "conscience for hire" premise with a clear Decisive Change (Keegan accepting the terrifying truth). Closure lands effectively with a tangible cost (public admission of failure) under a Hybrid Situational/Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, linear instructional scene that successfully delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the climax relies on the mentor explicitly explaining the epiphany ("The delayed revelation is...") rather than the protagonist earning it solely through the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on a convenient coincidence (the arrival of the birds) to resolve the central mystery, lacking a causal chain driven by the protagonist's active pursuit. The resolution is a "soft reset" that brings peace without a legible price paid by the protagonist, making the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is competent and the orientation is clear, but the trajectory is linear and predictable, moving from attempt to success without a decisive twist or complication. The closure acts as a validation loop for the protagonist's existing beliefs rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration earned through a new, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, utilizing the lantern festival effectively as both atmospheric backdrop and causal cover for the heist. The mnemonic logic regarding the key tag (Room 217) is inventive, bridging the hotel backstory with the shipwreck setting. Closure is distinct and resonant, with the retrieval of the journals marking a clear before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist succeeds at every step without setbacks or complications. The closure provides a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but it feels unearned because there is no on-page cost or tightening of options to precede the realization. The structure relies on sequential success rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight and structurally sound; finding the recordings motivates the visit, and the observatory setting provides the necessary tools for the climax. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration—she creates a new tool (crystals) and redefines her role. The narrative drive holds firmly under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative pressure leading to Causal breakthrough).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal logic of the magic system is internally consistent and the closure lands effectively with the "falling upward" imagery and the implied lifetime service. The narrative arc is clean, though the climax resolves with slightly convenient ease ("It shouldn't have worked... But... it unfolded anyway"), lacking a moment of near-failure to test the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "trail of photographs" resting on a mudbank after a forty-foot water drop defies physics; paper would scatter or dissolve, making the setup feel contrived. The transition to the "Within a week" summary resolves the conflict with the supervisor too neatly, bypassing the immediate tension of the insubordination.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "epiphany" structure where the solution is provided by the environment rather than earned through trial. The closure—a realization that solves the scientific problem—lacks a palpable cost or complication, making the victory feel convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving cleanly from inciting incident (radio message) to crisis and resolution under a Causal lens. Orientation is excellent, grounding the reader immediately. The closure—an Earned Stasis where she accepts the burden—lands effectively, though the shift to transparency ("invite them to send observers") glosses over the logistical isolation established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is strong: Yoon’s intervention in the dojo directly reframes Kenji’s perspective, leading to the decisive action in court. Closure is distinct and meaningful (Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change), resolving the legal plot through a character-driven choice. Orientation is immediate and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary to cover a multi-month timeline, reading more like a synopsis than a dramatized story, which violates the scope defaults for this length. A significant logic gap exists: Miranda designs a puzzle about the sender's identity, implying she solved the mystery off-page, yet the narrative never shows this discovery, stripping the climax of causal validity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a strictly linear path (Plan → Execution → Success) with no complications, setbacks, or doubts to test the protagonist. While the closure is legible, the lack of causal friction or obstruction makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-cost rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the realization that the garden is the library recontextualizes the entire setting and her role within it. The arrival of the pendant via unseen hands is slightly convenient, but the protagonist’s agency in engaging with it and accepting the burden of memory secures the arc. The lens holds a consistent situational focus that resolves into earned acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens where the realization about "successive approximations" directly fuels the climax. Closure is strong, with a Decisive Change (vivification) and Resonant Reconfiguration (abandoning the destiny) that lands with the conceptual cost of betraying her master's teachings.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing ending, where the "noise" is recontextualized as interference. However, the lack of immediate, felt cost reduces the impact; the resolution feels like a pure gain rather than a complex reconfiguration of stakes. The orientation and causal logic are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the radio acts as a magical fix, restoring the world without a visible cost or sacrifice. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—everyone is saved, the world is fixed—which undercuts the weight of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts a constructed reality; the cost (surrender to the illusion) is structurally sound and closes the loop effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal arc: the Visitors' arrival creates a knowledge gap, leading Yael to a specific, cost-laden decision. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing ancient methods as the bridge to the future.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The climax occurs off-stage and is reported via a phone call ("Twenty minutes later... they'd found Elena"), which robs the narrative of its peak tension. Causality relies on convenient access to medical records and an immediate, unquestioning acceptance of her supernatural claim by authorities, removing necessary narrative resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and the pacing aligns well with the tidal clock. However, a significant credibility gap exists regarding the facility's condition: electronics submerged in saltwater for fifteen years would not power on, especially if the facility is unsealed enough for water to seep in. This convenience undermines the "hard" reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective textural structure: waiting, ritual, vision, and release. Closure is decisive and earned—the cessation of counting acts as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. The transition from the vision to the thematic conclusion is slightly abrupt but structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Over the following months," "She had studied... for years") to bridge key moments, which dilutes the immediacy of the "continuous scene" or "mosaic" requirement. The closure is strong, offering a Conceptual Repricing of language, but the path there lacks a dramatized pressure cooker effect due to the time jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the logic regarding the mother’s state creates a causal wobble: if she died three years ago, the mechanism of her being "taken before death" and returned to a different plane contradicts the established premise of the 17 physical returnees. The closure is decisive, but this foundational ambiguity weakens the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path where the protagonist succeeds immediately upon trying. While the ending constitutes a Decisive Change (the orchard leaves), the lack of complication or setbacks robs the climax of tension, and the resolution comes without the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and the orientation within the "cobalt arcade" is excellent, grounding the reader immediately. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bottle becomes a vessel for healing—lands effectively. The structure is linear and stable, though the causal pressure is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient fairy-tale logic—a "wrong turn" leads directly to a magically pristine carousel car in a rust yard—which lowers causality stakes. Closure is achieved through a tidy restoration that resolves the central lack (silence) without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or pay a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly, but the "cost" is negligible; the protagonist solves the puzzle and feels satisfied. The "interference patterns" discovery relies on a convenient moment of observation rather than a forced error or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.9)
    The closure hinges on a significant causality break: Marina uses the palette daily for six months but fails to see a message scratched into the lid—the primary surface for mixing paints—until the plot requires it. This "convenient blindness" undermines the narrative logic and makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanism is external (the device chimes), bypassing protagonist agency at the crucial turning point. The narrative relies on a linear "magical service" template where the solution is purchased rather than earned through active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, with a clear setup and resolution under a Causal lens. However, the closure—becoming "whole again"—feels tidy and lacks a distinct, dramatized cost in the present moment; the price was paid in the backstory, making the resolution feel more like a reward than a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative sets up a compelling premise but resolves the central obstacle through a summary bridge rather than a dramatized causal turning point. The leap from diagnosis to cure happens off-screen during the tea montage, weakening the causal chain that leads to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and procedural (arrival, process, departure) with a climax summarized ("The work took hours") rather than dramatized. Closure is weak; the ending ("The work, as always, continued") returns to the status quo without a decisive change or a felt cost beyond temporary physical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal lens; the revelation of the brother’s betrayal pivots the goal from release to confrontation seamlessly. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence—heavier and emptier—satisfying the requirement for a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, moving from the assignment to the film comparison and finally to the "archaeological wound" recommendation. The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing of the site's value, though the sudden availability of the geological survey to confirm the grass pattern feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving linearly from a physical quest to a profound Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's worldview. The discovery of the log serves as a decisive pivot that reconfigures the meaning of the search without forcing a false victory.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a retrospective block ("discovered it three weeks ago") that saps immediate scene tension. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the solution relies on the convenient, undramatized flexibility of the monastery's mechanisms rather than a constrained tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The elevator's ascent provides a perfect structural clock for the accumulative drive lens. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned and permanent; the choice to pack while preserving the "encrypted joy" resolves the tension between loss and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under an Accumulative lens, moving from observation to a decisive conceptual repricing of "madness" as data. The closure—choosing to present the telescope as evidence—lands with a felt professional risk (cost) and deepens the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands with a clear thematic shift. However, the plot functions largely as a linear fetch-quest without significant obstacles; the "summoning" is a convenient inciting incident that meets little resistance. The final resolution relies on an implied action (measuring the corpse) that wasn't dramatized, slightly weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path, but the resolution hinges on a convenient "magic button" logic where a chalk grid inexplicably controls the atmosphere. The closure lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; the protagonist succeeds instantly upon realization without sacrifice or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where progress is dictated by convenient instructions (prophecy scraps) rather than causal deduction. While the closure lands as a conceptual realization, the lack of friction makes the journey feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage, moving quickly through conflicts that would benefit from dramatization. While the closure (Mirela resting) is distinct, the climax is resolved too neatly via a speech and a unanimous vote, which lowers the sense of earned narrative weight. The pacing is competent for a fable-like structure but lacks the granular causality of a literary short story.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ending achieves a strong Conceptual Repricing, shifting the clock's function from measurement to preservation ("inward"). The mechanism of the "pane of hush" provides a coherent, if surreal, logic that earns the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the discovery of the blueprint to the successful rescue. While the discovery of the nut is a convenient inciting incident, the resolution requires active competence, and the closure lands with a legible recontextualization of Maren's role.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene is coherent and the inciting observation causally drives the conclusion. However, the resolution violates the cost principle; the epiphany resolves the central professional and personal conflict by declaring that both paths are possible ("pursue both simultaneously"), which dissolves the narrative tension without a felt trade-off or price.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, gathering density until the "conceptual repricing" closure where silence is revealed as the origin of story. The structure is elegant and the closure is legible, though the "cost" is primarily conceptual (carrying the weight of the world's pain) rather than visceral or dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured, moving from the breach to the descent, the confrontation, and the release. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the internal work of "gentling" the memories causes the external environment to weep and decompose, beautifully externalizing the resolution. Causality is unbroken and the pacing is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a defined beginning, middle, and end, but the resolution relies on a low-resistance turn. The deep-seated trauma of the Elevator Seven residents dissolves too easily after a single speech, making the closure feel unearned and convenient rather than causally rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path of discovery, but the closure lacks a felt cost; Maya simply decides to fix the problem and succeeds. The resolution ("returning dreams") feels like an abstract conceptual upgrade rather than a hard-won consequence of the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear structure (discovery, journey, execution) that provides solid orientation and readability. The closure is a functional Decisive Change, but the lack of complications or a &quot;felt cost&quot; moment makes the resolution feel like a symmetric satisfaction rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the causality is clear, leading to a legible conceptual repricing at the end. However, the trajectory is linear and low-tension; the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, creating a sense of symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is complete and structural closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality, however, is extremely low-friction; the solution (teaching chess) works immediately without complication or setback, resulting in a linear progression that lacks the tension of a "try-fail" cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure, building pressure through failed frequencies until the correct emotional resonance unlocks the diary. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: opening the diary recontextualizes the sister's silence from trauma to resilience. The magical realism logic (tuning emotions) is consistent and serves the resolution without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a multi-year summary structure that violates the short-story scope default (single scene or shards), dissipating narrative tension. While the conceptual closure is legible (finding stillness within motion), it is delivered through montage and exposition rather than a decisive, dramatized event.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a legible Decisive Change where Kael secures proof. However, the plot pivots on an exposition-heavy monologue that resolves the central mystery too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    The investigation proceeds linearly with convenient discoveries (the charts, the center) smoothing the path to resolution. The ending—revealing evacuation rather than death—deflates the tension and lacks a palpable cost; the tragedy is erased, leaving a "safe" conclusion that fails the rubric's requirement for a felt price paid for the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with a clear inciting setup and resolution. The logistical patch of using &quot;intermediaries&quot; to arrange the sculptor's timing undermines the mystical synchronicity, and the ending relies on an &quot;explain-everything&quot; montage that resolves the global stakes too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal/Investigative lens, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing closure. The structure is efficient: investigation leads to a test, which yields a realization that reweights the premise (it was age, not error). The cost is the finality of the separation; the mystery is solved, but the loss is confirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist reclaims agency ("his own uncertain hands") with visible cost (the shattered fragment). The causal chain from Mira's intervention to the printing experiment is tight and logical under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, using two distinct encounters to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's view on her routine. Closure is strong, with the final image recontextualizing the "fade from memory to myth" refrain. Causality is intact; the pendant's mechanics consistently drive the interactions that lead to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a hypothesis to a test and finally a confirmation (Decisive Change). The causality relies on the convenient, specific magic of the frost-reading functioning exactly as hoped on the first try, which lowers tension slightly, but the closure lands with a legible shift in world-state.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure where magic functions as a convenient bridge without clear rules or resistance. The closure lands a Decisive Change (the message is sent, the mother fades), but the mechanism—weaving puzzle pieces to cross time—relies on assertion rather than causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong, with the backstory of the barter seamlessly fueling the present-action cost. The ending delivers a high-quality Resonant Reconfiguration: the planet wakes exactly as the protagonist is hollowed out, creating a symmetrical and costly closure that lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving efficiently from the inciting pull of the shard to the discovery and final choice. The structure supports the "Causal" lens well, with the protagonist’s skills enabling the journey. The closure is a solid Decisive Change, though the "illegal mapping" reveal functions as a late explanatory patch rather than a pressure built throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative momentum stalls significantly after the inciting incident (lamp out) for a large block of backstory that explains the stone ritual. There is a logic gap in the premise: a professional supply skipper ignores a failed automated light to perform a ritual, and the external crisis is resolved by sunrise rather than action. The closure lands on a decision, but the physical logic supporting it (the glass transfer) is muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is functional but linear, lacking a sharp causal turn. The inclusion of the salvage captain's perspective relies on unearned omniscience that disconnects from the protagonist's agency. Closure lands as Earned Stasis but feels low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.5)
    A critical causality/timeline break undermines the climax. The proprietor recognizes the donor's influence via the wing, but the protagonist has owned the wing for thirty years (predating the heart). If the wing habit is her own, it cannot be the signal of the donor's presence. Reliance on this impossible coincidence to drive the revelation breaks narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is efficient, moving logically from the inciting pin to the sextant and final reconfiguration. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the labyrinth's purpose. The progression is somewhat frictionless, resolving a centuries-old systemic issue with a single rapid experiment, but the logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from fragmentation to cohesion to dissolution with clear causality. The middle section relies on a montage-like expansion ("drifted through the greenhouse walls") to resolve the global stakes, which softens the immediate scene pressure and leans on summary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on coincidence ("mistake") for the inciting incident and resolves via a low-pressure epiphany that grants the protagonist a "best of both worlds" outcome without visible cost. The closure—joining a society while remaining a recluse—feels like symmetric satisfaction, lacking the "felt cost" or trade-off required for a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the decision to plant the east wing) acts as a resonant reconfiguration of the initial stakes. However, the central turn relies heavily on the old woman's expository dialogue to explain the story's mechanics and the protagonist's own motivation, which saps some tension.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is solid, pivoting cleanly at the "Unless" realization to set up a meaningful closure. The Decisive Change (releasing the seed, staying to die) lands with significant weight. A slight reliance on summary ("Hours passed") during the pivotal rewriting sequence elides the mechanical struggle, softening the immediate pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is efficient and causality is tight, delivering a clean execution of the "canary trap" plot device. Closure is definitive, utilizing a Decisive Change that reconfigures the protagonist's stance from avenger to protector.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—relinquishing the compass—is a distinct, legible act of reconfiguration. However, the climax relies heavily on a static block of realization ("Everything was emergent") that resolves the central mystery intellectually before the character acts, slightly deflating the final beat's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a "fantasy of rescue" where a coincidental meeting resolves the inciting incident without the protagonist earning the outcome. The closure lacks a felt price; the gallery space and validation are gifted rather than won, making the ending feel unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery track with clear orientation, but the journey to the archive lacks significant obstacles or complications. The closure feels unearned and tidy, resolving the societal conflict with a promise of future action ("They would return") rather than a paid cost or concrete consequence in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "ritual" structure (setup, process, success) with no inciting incident to disrupt the routine or threaten the outcome. Closure is structurally present (the ice finishes melting) but lacks narrative tension; the "problem" of lost nuance is resolved effortlessly as the audience immediately understands the message, resulting in a low-stakes vignette rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting magnetic shift to a decisive ritualistic resolution. While the link between physical fire and digital code repair relies on poetic logic, the closure (Earned Stasis) is earned and resonant, leaving the protagonist changed but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the closure—opening the mailbox—is conceptually sound, but the climax relies on the convenient arrival of Iris at the precise moment Maya is waiting. While the investigation phase works, the resolution feels smoothed over by coincidence rather than driven by inevitable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scene is a linear execution of a plan rather than a narrative with turning points; the outcome feels inevitable from the first paragraph. While the imagery is strong, the lack of a "tightening" beat or an unexpected obstacle flattens the causal drive toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving cleanly from the inciting anomaly to a method of resolution; the connection between the inland drift of pockets and the coffee cup discovery preserves causality. Closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new, purposeful stasis with clear trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined objective and resolution (Conceptually Repriced: salvation as ignorance). The climax relies on a slight capability leap—remote telekinesis to spill water, whereas prior magic was established as mental/consciousness-based—which feels like a convenient resolution to the final obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The progression from mundane sugar-borrowing to supernatural revelation is structurally sound and well-paced. The transition from the summary of lessons to the specific scene on the rooftop anchors the arc effectively, though the inciting incident for the interrogation feels slightly low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure, but the resolution arrives too easily; the "experiment" succeeds immediately without complication or on-page cost. The closure is legible (Decisive Change) but lacks the "felt price" required for higher bands, as the antagonist folds instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is a linear process vignette (mixing ink to finishing document) that lacks causal surprises or immediate obstacles. While the closure (document complete, thorn left behind) is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of on-page turning points makes the progression feel inevitable and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Over the following nights") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, bypassing the necessary dramatic confrontation. The resolution relies on a mystical explanation delivered via dialogue rather than a protagonist-driven reconfiguration of stakes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation is clear, but the central deduction—linking a snow globe dream to specific climate data—lacks causal grounding on the page, relying on psychic convenience; the closure is a declared intent without an immediate, paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative traces a clear Accumulative arc, moving from observation to a crystallized teaching strategy (the whisk test). Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise—she is ready for the student—but the stakes of the "turn" are low-voltage, relying on internal preparation rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central investigation is summarized ("Hours passed") rather than dramatized, which lowers the tension of the discovery. While the closure works conceptually, the logic—that the "comfortable lie" protects the orchard better than the truth—relies on unarticulated assumptions about the survivors' psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece fails the scene-window default, functioning as a synopsis of months/years ("As months passed") rather than a dramatized event. There is no immediate causal pressure or distinct beat; the ending is a conceptual realization disconnected from a specific, high-stakes "now."

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is legible, but the sudden appearance of a "recording device" to transport the sounds blurs the established logic of the jar magic and solves the logistical problem too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a decisive resolution that honors the story's logic. Closure is strong, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the threat is transformed rather than simply defeated. The pacing moves efficiently from the establishment of the anomaly to the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear plan-then-execution structure with no significant complications or deviations. While the orientation and logic are sound, the absence of an on-page obstacle or tightening causality results in a flat arc; the ending feels like a procedural step completion rather than a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The investigation follows a clear causal chain, and the closure (a decision to expose corruption) is legible and motivated. The plot relies on convenient discoveries (camera repositioned, fresh scratches) that yield too easily to inspection, reducing the narrative tension. The final beat feels slightly unearned in its certainty that the antagonist's influence is already cracking.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a massive coincidence—that the shop owner happens to have the daughter’s box—to resolve the central logistical conflict. This "deus ex machina" removes the protagonist's burden of restitution and lowers the structural integrity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure successfully gathers weight through the kaleidoscope's observations, leading to a resonant closure where Fennec reaffirms her purpose. While the orientation and drive are clear, the narrative arc remains somewhat static; the "cost" of her isolation is an existing condition rather than a price paid freshly in this specific window.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story relies on narrative summary and montage ("37th day") to compress the investigation, which creates some distance before the scene focuses on the climax. However, the causal chain remains unbroken, and the closure acts as a clear Decisive Change where the protagonist abandons safety for a rescue mission. The pacing is efficient, though the middle section feels more like a synopsis than a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a magical shortcut (induced empathy via the crystal) and a heavy-handed coincidence (the rivals' children playing together outside) rather than earned character choices. The climax lacks causal friction; the leaders capitulate instantly upon seeing the vision, making the outcome feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a static reflection to a kinetic rescue that reconfirms the protagonist's changed state. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Vera retains the appointment but inhabits the "fold in patience," accepting a liminal existence. The cost—surrendering the illusion of control over her final chapter—is legible and thematically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is solid, with the missed bus creating effective situational pressure that forces the conversation and closure. Orientation is handled well, creating a legible scene that moves logically to a Resonant Reconfiguration of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the ritual structure provides a clean line to closure. The ending creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (the new clearing), though the linear progression—arrival, agreement, success—lacks a moment of doubt or complication to test the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance; the central conflict (trauma) is resolved through immediate consensus without obstacles or causal setbacks. The resolution (the decision to build a garden) is summarized rather than dramatized, resulting in a "soft reset" ending devoid of legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "Charged Poise" closure works well to resolve the preparation beat. However, the logic of a "reflective" crystal capturing future voices ("astronaut" reaching forward) strains causality without sufficient grounding, blurring the magic system's rules for thematic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central mechanic of "precognitive forgetfulness" driving the placement of driftwood markers is a clever causal chain that anchors the plot effectively. However, the phrasing "route his future self had mapped" creates a logical stumble (confusion between precognition and action). The closure—transferring the burden of memory to Sarah—is resonant and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the recontextualization of the clock as a seismometer is a clever turn. However, the resolution relies on a slight causality gloss: the leap from "clock measures tremors" to "telescope captures perfect photos" assumes an unspoken adaptive-optics link that feels convenient. The closure is solid, though the technical victory is somewhat obscured by the metaphorical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from a significant causality gap: Maya calls 17 times without result, then succeeds on the 18th by sharing information ("he is dying") that should have been the initial premise. The resolution is unearned and overly tidy ("symmetric satisfaction"), with the "method" (recordings) appearing decorative rather than causally essential to Linda's return.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a high-stakes Charged Poise; the causal chain from the key’s discovery to the chamber’s reveal is tight and logical. The recontextualization of the protagonist’s nature forces a clear, cost-heavy decision window (the approaching noon) without breaking the established drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative is cohesive and the "bone-setting as reality-repair" mechanic provides a logical resolution. However, the closure lacks a distinct felt cost; the solution is procedural and frictionless (a montage of rearranging), resolving the central tension too neatly. The inciting mystery (substitute body) is compelling but the resolution feels more like a magic trick than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure works well for this meditative piece, leading to a legible closure where the "white glass" is placed. However, the narrative relies on reported off-stage validation (notes from strangers) to bolster the resolution rather than earning it solely through the immediate scene. The pacing is consistent, though the "memories resurfaced" transition is somewhat repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing the single scene to bridge the gap between past trauma and present healing. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the woman’s departure, though the resolution relies heavily on a verbal explanation rather than purely dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the pivotal turn relies on a stranger explicitly articulating the story's solution in dialogue. This externalizes the insight and makes the resolution feel handed to the protagonist rather than fully earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the orientation is solid, but the closure relies on symmetric satisfaction—the ritual works exactly as planned without unforeseen complications. The lack of a "Decisive Change" involving a hard choice or significant cost limits the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain of the ritual is tight, and the closure—a Decisive Change via the burning map—lands with clear cost (impermanence requiring memorization). The "neutron star" identification relies on a slight knowledge leap that feels convenient, but the internal logic of the magic system holds the structure together firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is distinct and clear, but the middle section relies on a summary montage of "weeks" rather than a dramatized scene, which flattens the narrative arc and reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, descending deeper into the grotto to a pivotal realization (Conceptual Repricing). The closure works as a legible recontextualization of her duty, though the lack of external friction makes the pacing feel somewhat uniform and the "cost" is purely philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure builds a coherent portrait of grief, ending in valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The "kettle" timeframe functions as an inciting clock, though the scene's energy dissipates slightly as the action extends well past the boil.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is sound, using the discovery of the wheel as a clear inciting incident that drives a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The shift from paralysis to "modest platforms" lands with legible conceptual cost (scaling down ambition to make it achievable).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("She spent the next week...", "They worked through autumn...") to bypass the actual conflict and work of the story. This violates the scope expectation for dramatized scene work, reducing the inciting incident and climax to a project timeline rather than a narrative arc. The closure is a tableau of success without a felt on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is solid, anchoring the flashback effectively to the present stimuli. Closure lands clearly via a resonant reconfiguration of her stance toward the violin, though the beat relies on a safe, linear progression.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative suffers from a causality gap where radio silence triggers a massive deductive leap ("payment ended," "hoax confirmed") without sufficient evidence. The protagonist's ability to reconstruct the entire backstory and locate hidden maps instantly via "instinct" undercuts the investigative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a significant convenience: Maren happens to be carrying the exact rare fulgurite needed for the recipe she decodes in that moment. This coincidence resolves the central obstacle (lacking the means to wake the seeds) without earned effort or procurement cost, short-circuiting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "living obituary" concept frames the encounter well, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the turning point relies heavily on a monologue to dissolve the obstacle, lacking a sharp causal "click" where a difficult choice forces the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing a "Conceptual Repricing" closure where the prince accepts the flawed hybrid. The pacing relies heavily on summary ("weeks of discovery") to bridge the middle, which lowers the immediate scene pressure, but the causality holds firm under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scene is structurally coherent and anchors orientation well, but the trajectory is linear and predictable. The closure relies on a "Conceptual Repricing" (grafting beauty onto the past) that feels summarized rather than dramatized through a hard choice or cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with excellent orientation and a clear fable-like logic. The closure is distinct (a Resonant Reconfiguration of the city's state), but the lack of resistance from the environment makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The &quot;cost&quot; is the loss of a curse, which functions as a reward, lowering the dramatic weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear situational arc, using the gear's calculation to trigger a reflection that solidifies the Keeper's stance. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis—a conscious decision to maintain the cycle despite the predicted sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Each dusk that followed") that dilutes tension and renders the piece more like a summary than a dramatized scene. Closure is achieved through a lecture from the ghost rather than a hard-won realization or decisive action with visible cost. The pacing feels episodic, lacking the causal snap required for a short story.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds toward the ritual transfer, and the closure (the empty rake handle) offers a resonant reconfiguration of the burden. The narrative arc is clean, though the backstory insertion in the third paragraph slightly stalls momentum before the active ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inciting incident works well, but the decoding sequence relies on a significant logic leap; the translation of thread direction/color into specific letters ("Blue threads pulled left: B, E, N") is a convenience that bypasses the actual mechanism of decryption. The closure is legible, but the "puzzle" element feels like a contrived genre device rather than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (Problem -> Process -> Solution) that lacks a decisive turn or reconfiguration of stakes. The closure is weak because it offloads the actual decision to the off-stage Council, leaving the protagonist in a state of static completion rather than paid cost or changed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative structure works well, building the "weight" of stories until they manifest physically; closure lands with a resonant image, though the patrol beat is a standard obstacle that resolves without complicating the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative operates under a clear Situational/Hybrid lens, using the death vigil to pressure the reveal of Mira's secret practice. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the gallery's mission of impermanence is revealed to be a "mirage," recontextualizing the entire story with a felt cost of secrecy and "agony."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive, using the artifacts to build pressure before the patrol boat catalyzes a defensive stance. Closure is an effective Earned Stasis, where he accepts his isolation to preserve truth. The plot is functional but low-velocity; the primary turn involves passive hiding rather than a tactical trade-off or active risk.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on montage summary ("Week after week," "By November") to bridge the conflict, violating the requirement for a dramatized scene with causal drive. The resolution is reported rather than earned through immediate action, resulting in a low-stakes linear progression.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that moves smoothly from planting to harvest without structural resistance. The "once-in-a-lifetime" alignment functions as a convenience to bypass the natural duration of growth, resolving the plot instantly. Closure is tidy and symmetric ("ruin" to "beginning"), lacking the jagged edge of a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magical stranger" (deus ex machina) to hand the protagonist the solution, bypassing investigative causality. The resolution is an "explain-everything" ending where the engineer immediately accepts the fix without resistance, creating a soft reset with no dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence (finding the exact orris root needed on the beach that morning) to resolve the central mystery, which undercuts the causal chain. While the closure (the house exhaling) is resonant, the mechanism to achieve it lacks earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is efficient, and the inciting incident and closure are clear. However, the plot relies heavily on the "explain-everything" monologue (telepathy) to deliver backstory, rather than dramatizing the discovery. The causal chain holds, but the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational hybrid lens, moving from hypothesis testing to a decisive Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's reality. The realization that Elena powers the machine offers a strong closure unit with undeniable conceptual cost. The loop is closed logically, and the orientation within the infinite space is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the scene is well-anchored, but the causality relies on a magical object that smooths over all obstacles. The closure lands safely but feels low-cost, as the resolution (sleep, connection) is granted by the prop rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is efficient and confident, utilizing a Causal drive lens where the accumulated pressure of the tour culminates in a decisive interaction. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration moving from static preservation to active continuity—lands with clarity and thematic weight. The orientation is immediate and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (a Decisive Change where the protagonist is unmade) lands with conceptual weight. However, the middle section relies on a montage of "instant expertise" to bridge the gap between finding the object and mastering it, which flattens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc relies on a "guide ex machina" structure where the solution—the grandmother's philosophy and the specific instruction to "unbosom"—is handed to the protagonist rather than earned. The closure lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of a "try-fail" cycle or active problem-solving makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from warning to resolution. However, the closure relies on a standard "success through competence" outcome without a "felt cost" or deep conceptual reweighting. The resolution feels safe, offering victory without a lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is resonant, but the middle section relies on convenience. The existence of "emergency hatches the council had forgotten" removes the physical obstacle of the sealed gate too easily, and the pattern language revealing the truth "immediately" shortcuts the process of discovery, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from discovery to decision, landing a valid Decisive Change closure with a recognized cost (career). The inciting incident (finding the letter exactly where promised) is functional but lacks friction, making the setup feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is linear and anecdotal, functioning more as a vignette than a story with causal drive. While the closure (placing the note) is conceptually coherent, it lacks a decisive turn or felt cost; the protagonist simply executes a plan without obstruction or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive: blackout -> access -> discovery -> threat -> escape. The closure works well as a Charged Poise moment, where the protagonist sits ready with the truth, reconfiguring the initial stillness into resistance. The retrieval of the file is slightly convenient (third cabinet), but the pacing handles the short form well.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story relies on a montage ("Night after night," "Other residents... began to visit") to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and resolution. This breaks the single-scene tension required for this length, replacing dramatized causality with narrative summary, though the final closure image is conceptually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a magnificent Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing that feels both inevitable and costly; the choice to "make survivors of everyone" perfectly resolves the causal drive. The mechanics of the "unused potential" provide a sturdy logic for the awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—scan chip, fly drone, find signal—lacking friction, setbacks, or a moment of doubt that would earn the resolution. Closure is achieved through a clear Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of resistance makes the payoff feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is impeccable under a Causal/Revelatory lens. The sequence of physical discovery (the watch hand) leading to a conceptual re-pricing of the backstory (Iris's true fear) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible emotional cost. The pacing perfectly supports the weight of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens, moving from stalemate to a high-stakes accord. Closure lands as Charged Poise; the agreement to trade "real histories" reconfigures the conflict with a legible future cost (political risk).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a decisive physical action (launching the kayak) that functions as strong closure. However, the inciting turn relies heavily on an external catalyst (James’s text) and a summarized epiphany ("It felt clarifying") to bridge the gap between stasis and movement, slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the ending relies heavily on an "explain-everything" monologue where a secondary character articulates the protagonist’s entire future and purpose. The transition from memory-wiped rehabilitation to cracking complex newspaper codes via "force of habit" feels convenient, and the climax dissolves tension through exposition rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ritual provides a sturdy causal spine that leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The drive lens is consistent, though the ending acts more as an acquisition of ability than a costly sacrifice, slightly softening the narrative bite.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a physical ascent to a psychological realization with clear causality. The closure lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the desire for lost time into accepted wisdom, anchored by the physical descent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative causality is strong, particularly the "physics of grief" setup (happiness = lightness) paying off at the climax. The resolution leans slightly on soft causality ("the lock recognized them") rather than a hard causal turn, but the structural integrity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The reliance on prophecy undermines causal drive; events occur because they are script-destined, not because of the protagonist's decisions under pressure. Closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing, but without prior resistance or a visible on-page cost, the resolution feels inevitable and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from the blackout to the retrieval of intelligence and the successful evasion of the guard. The ending achieves a valid "Charged Poise," effectively setting the stage for future conflict, though the immediate resolution feels somewhat convenient given the ease of bypassing the guard.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative builds effective pressure, but the climax relies on an "explain-everything" epiphany triggered by the star dust rather than a decisive protagonist action. The closure lands as a conceptual summary ("burden to blueprint") rather than a dramatized event, reducing the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is sound, moving from a static vigil to a decisive action (opening the envelope) that alters the protagonist's trajectory. The closure—committing to witness state violence—is a valid Decisive Change with implied cost. However, the connection between the storm's "mask slipping" timing and the darkroom work feels thematic rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, with a clear turning point where the protagonist reveals the secret code to leverage a truce. The closure lands with a "Charged Poise," effectively shifting the antagonist's stance. The transition from combat to negotiation is earned, though the antagonist's acceptance feels slightly swift given the prior hostility.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure effectively weaves the flashback with the present action, and the closure (emptying the letters/choosing a name) lands clearly. However, the progression lacks friction; obstacles are minimal, and the "instant community" resolution feels slightly convenient, bypassing the struggle of the "rebuild."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the clock ticking forward) creates a distinct resonant reconfiguration. However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the protagonist follows instructions to a magical solution rather than driving the plot through active inquiry or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal arc is coherent, moving clearly from the diagnosis in the dream-space to the physical remedy. However, the immediate reaction of the dream-mist to the physical planting feels causally convenient, a soft-magic shortcut that bypasses the "weeks to sprout" constraint established lines earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the closure creates a legible change in stance, the causal mechanism—reading specific therapy-speak instructions from knots in lace—strains credibility. The narrative relies on this convenient decoding to resolve the central conflict, bypassing the need for a harder, earned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dust-coated palm reweights her life-long preprocessing quest, visible cost in surrendering scientific distance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust layers, wing powder, sprouting vines accrue until meaning tilts. Pattern is taught early (shattered glass → strata photographs) and transitions are legible within the single scene. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: frost image reweights survival from cosmic purpose to humble accretion; cost is the surrender of grand narrative. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern (frost ≈ hidden networks) taught by 25 % and reprises in final line. One transition (night → dawn) is legible and coherent. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits at word 24; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Selected lens: Accumulative/Textural. The frost-panel, tuning-fork, and heat-map images layer until the final self-scan crystallizes a new cadence; each repetition adds density rather than outline. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marina’s own thermal notation appears on screen, re-weighting every prior composition as equally hers. The cost is the unspoken admission that no one else will hear her own melody—silence is no longer a canvas but a destination. Causality is intact: each compositional step is traceable to the ferry loss and the ruptured ear.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens reframes burial itself, turning the library into an endless crypt. Causal chain holds: lens → signals → recognition → spatial re-use → rest. The “impossible spaces” rule is taught early and pays off at the end. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens dominates: each bell-ring is a because/therefore trigger that eventually forces the public reveal. Orientation is swift—ridge, sanctions, night—well inside 120 words. Closure is on-page (collective shift from anonymous to communal care) and carries social cost (“not secret anymore”). One minor causality gap: how flour-sack donor knew to use the arbor is elided, not motivated, but it doesn’t touch the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal image reframes “unused love” as breath-released light, with conceptual cost legible in the golden pollen drifting upward. Causal linkage holds—each breath tightens the knot’s dissolution—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by line 6; transitions are smooth. One scaffold loop—“like ink in water, like stars in fog”—slightly dulls the final image, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared by the first paragraph (“yesterday, last month, centuries ago, all at once”) and held to the last breath. Each sensory parcel—fading photographs, warming halo shard, root-hairs threading stone—adds density until the fabric tears. The closure is a Charged Poise: Miriam becomes the garden’s memory, a conceptual repricing that makes her absence the price of the maze’s continued teaching. Causality is not linear but recursive, exactly as the hyperbolic premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because she mapped the keys, therefore she locates the vault; because liberation armies are nearing, she must impede them to save the seeds. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—chains removed, seeds handed forward, cost legible in her trembling freed hands. One tight scaffold: the carnival-game layout taught early (“Ring Toss at two o’clock…”) pays off in the five-pace move. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the crimson-true hammer-strike reweights every prior absence into acknowledgment. The accumulative/textural lens holds from first sensory chord to last; each “absence” layer tightens the acoustic profile until the final silver grain crystallizes the reconfiguration. Cost is indelible—her cells, her father’s silence, the client’s daughter’s hand are all fused into the filter that will outlive her. No causal jump or orientation drift; even the sunken greenhouse geography is re-anchored by geothermal/barnacle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is intact: stolen photo → decoded flowers → moon-curtain revelation → release. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—her destiny is not a door but a threshold she must keep crossing, and the released portraits reweight the world’s hidden light. The orientation is crisp inside 120 words. Still, the moon-curtain’s physics (“liquid light poured upward”) is sprung without prior rule-teaching, a mild teleporting-prop wobble that keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira sketches the next sanctuary while spring collapses winter’s architecture; cost is felt in the elegiac pipe-groan and revealed rock. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of melt/ice imagery reweights the stake of impermanence. The “And thus concludes…” sentence risks meta-wink, but cadence shift crystallizes rather than breaks the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: envelope → library → cast cipher → UV notes → seashell voice → prosecutors outside. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words: “rusted library beneath the indifferent stars,” name, object, and present danger. Mid-scene memory downloads (“Sophie always said…”) risk a BRR breach yet each is tethered to on-page stimuli (the seashell, Carson’s entrance) and shifts tactics. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: flashlight beams = decisive arrival, Maya’s starlit stance = cost felt, no mechanical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: “She sat in her marbled hush… began to map…” reconfigures meaning while the price—eternal starless exile—is legible. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; silence thickens like sediment until it crystallizes into map-medium. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“The ridge fort shuddered…”), well inside 120-word allowance. One soft spot: the oracle’s booklet functions as off-stage info dump; its rules are accepted rather than pressure-tested on-page, a micro-causality gap that holds the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: 341 → 342 iterations tighten density until cadence shift at the violin beat crystallizes meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: “always was where thoughts came from” reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost; persistent constraint (infinite sweep) shapes final image. Orientation clean by word 50; no causal breaks or prop teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands clean: the three walk upstairs toward accountability—an Earned Stasis that forecloses silence forever, cost felt in the forecourt’s “scattered evidence.” Causal chain holds: ticket stubs → eavesdrop → mutual confession → joint witness. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Lens is Causal; each beat tightens options because silence becomes collectively untenable once Mira speaks. Micro-turn is the projector lens reveal, but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every hedge inch gained overnight is a direct therefore of her resumed care after deliberate starvation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no drift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—sensor “luck” re-priced as reciprocal recognition—felt cost is the public exposure of her clandestine archive and the gamble she could have lost. Persistent constraint: the cracked marbles remain, future seasons still hang on her aging hands.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram proves sideways time, reframing physics with palpable conceptual cost. Causality is clean: secret experiments → illicit recording → lever pull → Voss confrontation → shared awe; each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (station, twilight, mechanic task). One minor scaffold: “always ready to help” is summary before we see it. Lens holds causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: flood → return → program → gap → journal → new artistic path, each beat forcing the next. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the journal re-weights music itself toward silence, with the lanterns’ steady flare signaling acceptance of that cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the first 90 words and the program’s circle-on-map beat confirms spatial logic mid-scene. Minor loop: “in-between spaces” is asserted more than dramatized in one late paragraph, but it never breaks the therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudge and recalibration reweight the rule-set of forecasting itself. The causal chain (ignored margin → death → fever confession → sensor reset) holds under a Causal lens with persistent cost—false positives now accepted. Orientation is clean (aurora dawn, station deck by line 3). No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes an irreversible operational change.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: “the living haunted themselves…” reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causality holds: the valve wheel → radio confession → EPA decision chain is legible, and the ghost-shift motif is retrospectively repriced. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (“callers’ frantic consistency”) and pays off in the final paragraph. Cost is felt, but because the confession is disembodied radio static and Mara’s agency stops at documentation, the price is vicarious rather than personal, keeping the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“chronicle of metamorphosis”) and holds: each sensory block adds density until the origami re-folds, re-pricing the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the keeper will forget yet feel weight, a felt cost legible in the final image. One causal micro-gap—how the stone initiates the origami fold—is waved by lyric contract; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is simple but coherent: eclipse invitation → shared twilight → curl + lullaby → rupture → rapprochement; each beat causes the next under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl in Diane’s palm reweights the past with undeniable emotional cost—an earned crystallization. No orientation drift; who/where/when land by line 60. The only causality slip is Maya’s passivity—she sets the stage but absorbs no consequence, so the Decisive Change is entirely external to her, slightly diluting global stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s ledger crystallizes the “bronze quiet” aftermath, reweighting human absence as archival duty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the phrase “amber suspension of aftermath,” yet the story stops short of showing how this cost constrains her next breath; the price is conceptual, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: “because” her cookies read as clues, “therefore” spies converge; the lighthouse beam’s regularity becomes Conceptual Repricing—open secrets stay open. Closure is clean: Margaret’s decision to perpetuate/own the flow lands on-page with the smile-as-cost. One shard, no teleporting props; microdot payoff seeded early. Minor slack: orientation (who/where) is implicit but taught by bar name & island by ~120 words, so waiver applies; no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: silence-recording tempts the entity → rhetorical questions expose its paradoxical premise → white-paint symbol of plenitude ejects it. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing delivered in two sentences (“Some demons are just bad arguments… they disappear”) whose conceptual cost (Micah’s fatigue, Elena's tear-streaked awe) is undeniable. Orientation and lens taught by line 3; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each fortune slip adds density until the pattern of “unheard symphonies” crystallizes in the final Charged Poise—Maya at rest, fortunes now “tiny conductors” abroad. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (spire, lake, dawn); no penalty. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost: the symmetry dissolves, her window closes, tomorrow’s labor is already foretold. Persistent constraint—only dawn yields truth—shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the runes’ new sentence reweights the entire quest from conquest to habitation, and Maya’s fall upward crystallizes that shift with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent—each 43-day return accretes density until the pattern breaks in the final beat. Orientation is quick: inverted on a viaduct, tablet humming, timelines branching—reader is anchored by line 3. The only minor scuff is the late-run abstraction “labyrinth of self” repeated; it slightly dilutes the moment of lived reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the concept of “filament of hush” until the final cavern session crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the broken needle on the shelf reweights the entire premise, making silence itself the instrument. Cost is felt—the cavern fills with “pilgrims” and Mira’s earlier solitude is permanently foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: tailing → message → recognition of weaponized data → lateral counter-plan. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the easy path (compliance) and accepts ongoing risk; cost is legible in the final sentence “They would see the surface. She would continue recording the depths.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One causality hairline: the pigeon arrives exactly when she needs confirmation—lucky, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: dead wife → vial → greenhouse wait → new bloom → identical scent → deliberate preservation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Dalton pockets the empty vial, reconfiguring grief from avoidance to stewardship; cost is the lifelong ache he now consents to carry. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop teleport; UV reveal taught early and paid off. Lens holds as causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope between them reconfigures the stake—choice is now lived, not theorized—and the cost is felt in the final image of simultaneous awe and vertigo. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each pattern layer deepens the conceptual price of choosing. Orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush loosens thread-by-thread, paid for by her fragmentary performance. Causality is accumulative/textural—sound layers until the atmosphere flips; the cost is the everlasting absence of finality she accepts. Orientation is taught early (dawn, mist, greenhouse) and the greenhouse-shipwreck echo loop is the taught pattern that pays off in the final image of rust-to-gold light.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: because Thomas arrives in grief, therefore Maren applies counterfeit; because she does, the memory is pacified, therefore her own authenticity erodes. Each step is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options for both client and dealer. Closure lands as Decisive Change: Maren files the spent petal, foreclosing the possibility of unmediated feeling for either party. Cost is visible in the wrist-blotter beat where she samples the residue, a self-dose that re-inscribes the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: mis-delivered letter → terrace meeting → shared recognition → joint commitment; each beat tightens options under the Causal lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the rooftop garden anchors who/where/when. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—she pockets the locket and walks into a new, unpaid workload—so the ending satisfies the required RR/DC test. One minor elasticity: the postal coincidence is pure luck, but it complicates rather than resolves, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpture’s unveiling crystallizes the community’s perpetual search as the real kinship engine, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—the sculptor trades solitude for cyclic participation. Causal linkage holds: her public vow → joint searches → shared stories → sculpture → belonging. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of communal ritual tightens until the final image reframes prior nights’ walks as the actual web. Cost is legible in the “luminescent ache” that now feels communal rather than alien.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sensory echoes accumulating density until the final cadence is restored. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) are in by line 3; rooftop canal, giant’s nap, and temporal theft are taught early and payoff at closure. Closure is a Charged Poise: the echo of her oar arrives before the stroke, reweighting the whole premise with undeniable conceptual cost—time debt paid in sound. Persistent constraint (pendant’s dwindling charge) shapes every tactical choice, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative lens holds: each dripping drop, each cracked tile, each line of the Fibonacci bloom adds density until the final image reweights “loss” as “negative space in the equation.” The Orientation Test is waived: cavern/orchard/moon anchors arrive by line 30 and the deliberate soft-focus on wife-as-absence pays off when the mosaic face resolves into her erased smile. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the eyes’ dissolution is the visible price, and the new geometry of tears-in-cracks makes absence legible as presence. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence—“the pattern continued, dovetailing loss and hope”—where pattern itself becomes the enduring constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens dominates: power outage → free movement → tape-sense memory → decision to surface. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—Maren’s anonymity is foreclosed when the boy sees her—earning a Resonant Reconfiguration under Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by word 70. No meaningful accumulation or mosaic pattern; single-scene default fits scope. The tape fragment and blue light echo at the end, reweighting visibility stakes without mechanical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the unpruned linden shelters birds, Marcus stands beneath it “continuously transformed,” cost felt in the irreversible wilding of his life’s work. Causality holds: storm wreckage → sees neglected survivors → first wire cut → cascading release → nursery reborn as partnership. Single-scene orientation is anchored within 120 words; no prop or geography drifts. The lens is Accumulative: repeated storms and loosenings reweight the stake until the final image crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wet canvas held overhead across the flooding causeway reweights earlier motifs—tide, basin, convergence—into a single charged image with felt cost (the painting may be ruined). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain trails, brooches, and twice-daily tides pattern toward this crystallized moment. Causality remains intact: because she follows the rain trails she finds the others; because they exchange brooches she sleeps and chooses to paint the basin. No orientation debt; geography and chronology stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cave’s song is permanently altered and Vera’s certitude is forfeited, cost legible in “the terrifying gift of genuine surprise.” Accumulative lens holds: each wonder she amplified layers into the emergent shadows that re-inhabit the cave. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: valve discovery → vision refinement → new charts → boats follow. Closure lands with visible cost—she risks first voyage, nets prove method. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each arrow-cracked block and mist-form adds density until the cathedral of whispers detonates meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s new cartographic vocation (“she would spend the rest of her days…”)—with undeniable conceptual cost: she forfeits ordinary life to midwife silence. Causality is clean: punch → gate → truth → vocation. The 120-word orientation test is met (midnight, abandoned district), so no penalty. A hairline slip: “she understood its purpose” tells rather than shows the punch’s agency, but the final image still reweights stakes, satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena stays to transcribe, foregoing the escape she once sought. The tile’s causal chain (whale song → crystalline recording → number shift → memory bleed) is legible and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual exposure to others’ grief. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is an earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the magnetic staircase crystallizes a before/after in Vesper’s existential stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is mostly steady, but orientation wobbles: “eastern wall suddenly opened” is a spatial leap without intermediate cue, and the dimensional rule-set is revealed retroactively, nudging the lens toward Accumulative rather than pure Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: swallowed SD → post-mortem retrieval prohibition → night-long vigil → biological release → ethical documentation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira refuses to forge, instead choosing truthful paperwork that forever forecloses her father’s path yet keeps his pot on the shelf—cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The vigil’s single-scene container holds pressure without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the newly-minted history is deposited in the labyrinth, making the unreal as tactile as memory. The “before” (raw data in battered notepad) versus “after” (gold-leafed fiction placed in weathering world) is legible and carries conceptual cost: she forfeits factual certainty for imaginative permanence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn entry thickens the texture until the pattern breaks outward into the maze. The final image crystallizes options—she can never retrieve what she leaves, yet chooses to leave it—so cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Pattern taught early: each fragment of overheard dialogue is a sedimentary layer that accrues until the final image of “toxic truths that refuse to dissolve.” Orientation is clean by 40 words; causality is internal but coherent—because she is dead on paper, therefore she can haunt the archive. The ending’s reweighting is unmistakable: the port becomes “a repository of erased histories” and her ghosthood the price; cost is felt, no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Marina listening to the unfinished cello reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she can never again claim myths are merely false. Causal chain holds: each seashell listening session tightens knowledge until the cello transform voices into music. The one soft spot: the sailor/librarian/child triad is reported, not dramatized, so the inciting repetition is slightly telegraphed. Still, cost is on the page in the blood-marked shell.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: demolition → encoded resistance → Marcus leak → cooperative proposal, each because/therefore link narrowing options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the raised hands do not guarantee success but crystallize a new social contract with the felt cost of carnival identity diluted. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. One scaffold lapse: “Three months later” is an un-cued time jump that slightly blurs escalation pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crater is already lost, but the chemical sunrise reweights the stakes, making preservation-by-light an irrevocable, costly substitute. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beacon adds density until the dawn flares create the resonant reconfiguration. Causality holds: every placement of a capsule is a because/therefore step toward the final portrait. Cost is legible in the line “Valentina was golden, eternal, and hers” where the past tense “was” admits the impending bulldoers.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer adds density until the final image of the restored drone reweights the stake of “making broken things whole.” Orientation is immediate; causality is internal to the craft logic and holds. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the hummingbird hums, Mercantile departs, mist lingers, options reconfigure around her continuing labor. Cost is felt obliquely (she stays while the world sails), but the beat is soft; hence not yet 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is sound: falcon → coded note → condensation pattern → lake-center coordinates → temporal-reversal hypothesis → tomorrow’s expedition, each because/therefore link tightening knowledge, not options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara sketches plans while the lake “exhales,” crystallizing a new rule-set (rivers return, not begin) with conceptual cost—she now must test ice that may kill her. The lens stays causal throughout; the only softness is that the decisive physical risk is deferred, slightly blunting felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the town humming while her footsteps fade reweights the premise—collapse averted, cost transferred to her perpetual exile. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork strike + footfall adds density until the pattern break (true bells) signals restoration. Orientation is swift—archway, three-week clock, keystone ritual all within 120 words. No teleporting props or soft resets; the price is the tuner’s endless departure, felt on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: signal → descent → recognition → transfer → collapse, each step a because/therefore linkage. The crystallized-prayer mechanic is taught on-the-fly yet paid off in the final image of temple rubble, giving visible conceptual cost (“memory of those who refused to be forgotten”). Closure lands with Charged Poise: the vial glowing in ascent reweights the premise under the “preserved memory” rule. Only the thinnest setup for Marina’s competence edge keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus presses forehead to lattice, trusting someone might listen—an unmistakable reconfiguration of a lifetime of disbelief. Causal lens holds: because father’s lies made warning worthless, therefore Marcus withholds speech, therefore the three die, therefore he must become hush itself. Cost is legible in the same breath that names trust for the first time. Orientation is clean (“lighthouse prison…reef” by line 2).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara accepts endless night as the price for trans-generational service, and the carved bead’s final placement anchors that cost in a physical act. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the ghost bride’s intermittent appearances tighten Elara’s knowledge and purpose until the greenhouse’s heart becomes a literal altar. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse stood like a cathedral…”). One minor soft spot: the grandmother’s original rescue is delivered in exposition rather than dramatized memory, but the closure image re-infuses that backstory with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accretive/textural lens holds: each catacomb foray adds sediment of ancestry and self-knowledge until the sundial’s re-emergence crystallizes the inversion theme. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira watches living-branch shadows slide across dead stone, feeling the price of future absence. Cost is visible in her conscious decision to keep leaving/returning. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (stained glass, chalk dust, graphite vanishing under scan) thickens the stake—analog persistence in a digitized world—until the final sweep of boot across chalk crystallizes the cost. Causality is implied ellipses rather than explicit “because,” but the pattern is taught early and lands in a Charged Poise. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (clipboard’s vanish-ink) shapes tactics and the final image reweights meaning without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new map (a literal embroidered warning) crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures her role from passive listener to clandestine actor—cost is her lost anonymity, felt in the candle-shadow dance. Causal chain holds: each overheard fragment → stitched star-route → assembled coup pattern → decision to speak, all under an Accumulative lens that tightens density rather than flipping events. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 50 words and never wavers. No lens ambiguity; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is clean and resonant: the final image of Isla running “toward reconciliation” crystallizes a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: the shard + moonlight beat evokes the memory, which re-visions the moment before choosing, which in turn authorizes the apology now speaking itself through her. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5. One minor slack: the “letters as portals” rule is asserted rather than dramatized in advance, but the condensation window pays it off vividly enough. Cost is unmistakable in the final stride toward the living world, foreclosing continued silence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a CR: the final image of “two translators…unknotting the past” reweights the premise—healing is not forgetting but collaborative re-inscription; cost is the irretrievable future time and emotional labor they now owe the dead. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each language fragment, coral touch, and mist bead adds density until the twilight tableau crystallizes a new moral rule-set—storykeeping is mutual. No orientation debt: by word 50 we know who (Maya, translator), where (recovery-center atrium), when (twilight after surgery). The persistent constraint—corpse of a vanished island carried in pocket—shapes every beat and final tactic: offer the fragment, share the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene architecture is clean: arrival → discovery → light-painting → dawn exit. Causality holds because the fresco’s painted reach motivates the new projection tactic that closes the gap for both child and artist. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the streamed orchard reweights “joy” from lost nostalgia to present practice, with visible cost—fading batteries and thinning fog—written into the final image. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (light-on-fog) intensifies rather than plots, satisfying the tightening rule.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marta’s backward/fall crystallizes the recursive rule—every awakening adds a layer, cost is the infinite deferral of final “real.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of murals/nickel/sound reweights stake rather than causal chain. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no lens ambiguity at end. One imperfection: the nickel’s rule-change (eyes open) is late-introduced magic; accept at this length because pattern is taught early by the singing wall.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: premise (“thoughts taxed”) → outlaw response → botanical code → covert gardens → closing image of gourd-rattle alive. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line 3). One meaningful tightening: Dr. Chen’s warning that auditors patrol gardens → Malachi’s retort that patterns will hide in plain sight; this narrows tactic and raises stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “they can’t tax what grows wild” reweights the premise with conceptual cost felt through the seed-heavy pockets and angry-sounding rattle; constraint persists because the towers still blink outside.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the shared planting reconfigures the poet’s centuries-long isolation and gives the moment palpable conceptual cost—“for the first time in three centuries.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension thickens through layered postcards, spiraling descent, and humming harmony with the off-key wind. Orientation is achieved by word 60, teaching the shell’s tilt and starlight; no mis-anchoring penalties apply. One minor causality gap: the postcard’s arrival “on a Tuesday” is never tethered to an in-scene trigger or cost, but it does not derail the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accumulates sonic and luminous textures until the new chime re-tunes the library, reweighting the stake with felt cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; the floating library and seventeen-year tenure ground orientation without debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchids blaze, the library sings, and Miren’s purpose is reframed as eternal custodianship of loss—cost is the unending ache she now names. Pattern holds; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the ink well reframed as “prism” crystallizes the before/after of trust restored yet paths diverging tomorrow; the causal lens holds because Maren’s solitary “unsnarling” is the necessary predicate for Kael’s decision to re-engage, and the cost—six months of silence, tomorrow’s separation—is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: empty envelope → adhesive analysis → 22-ft measurement → valve discovery → shared flow. Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost—ancestral compromise revealed, distrust dissolved, water re-allocated—and the lens holds. The “Compassion flows both ways” clue is the sole overt thematic echo, but it is dramatized, not sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dust-mote mapping, the shoebox archive, and the cracked choir recording accrete until the final playback reweights Elena’s invented life with undeniable cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena’s “Now we see who comes back” crystallizes options—truth released, abandonment risked—without yet paying the social price, but the cost is felt in the attic air. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are cleanly in place by line 4 and never drift. No因果 break; the recording’s arrival is coincidence that complicates rather than rescues, fitting accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through repeated “mapping” motifs—corn maze, flight log, oak grain—until the final image reweights “distance” from mathematical to existential. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s step through the prism dissolves the terrace, crystallizing that sacred = irreversible. Cost is legible in the dissolved planks and the prismatic fragmentation of memory; the price is the irreversible loss of the return path. Orientation is taught early (“drifting prism terrace…shifting panels”) and pays off when the same light fragments carry her loss away.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: artificial dawn + bioluminescent bloom reweight belonging without social negotiation; cost is conceptual—outsider identity dissolves in shared wonder. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of cross-species correspondence tightens once, no causal reversals. Orientation anchors in first 120 w (feather, dome, depth, salt, twenty-year gap). No contradiction, but the missing on-page beat where Mar’s method actually finds the core keeps the cost softer than high-band hit.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bracelet-vine crystallizes her vocation’s cost—bearing witness is itself a path she must keep walking. Causal chain holds: swallow-seeds → vine-maps → transliteration → insight → covenant. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Slight softening: the “why” is answered conceptually (“paths need repetition”) but no live option is foreclosed on page—cost is felt yet not paid in dramatic currency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: each intervention is legible as because/therefore, culminating in the group photo that crystallizes her absence. Closure is a Charged Poise: she forecloses the performer’s spotlight, paying with perpetual anonymity—cost is felt in the image of her stepping “deeper into shadow.” Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands in first 120 w, no penalty. Minor slack: the “invisible chessboard” rule is declared late, not seeded earlier to shape tactics; still, lens stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each dance phrase thickens starlight and pools time until the moonstone speck condenses; the final image of living tattooed archive reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 5; causality is lyric but coherent—stillness within motion produces the speck, the speck becomes pigment, pigment becomes archive. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she dances on, future path foreclosed, stakes crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: commission → secret experiment → portfolio that may halt demolition. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive in the first 90 words; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the satchel now contains “illumination” rather than glass, reweighting the premise—value is proved in refraction, not spreadsheets. Cost is visible: Samuel forfeits conventional labor for uncertain persuasion, walking away “carrying illumination” instead of wages.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—returning the box reweights the entire lineage of bargains and carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: father’s self-offer → town saved → son’s inherited debt → son’s conscious acceptance, each step legible. The ridge and celestial return create a tight chronological loop that tightens rather than teleports. No orientation debt; spatial–temporal anchors are clear by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each decorative addition tightens the pattern-density until the needle spike crystallizes the hope integral. Orientation is swift—grotto, sea level, repurposed gauge by line 5—and the final formula acts as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the gauge drops 2 feet, sealing the before/after. One minor causality fuzz: how the gauge’s sea-level impossibility is instantly accepted without micro-doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy, diary fragments, and pulse-echo pattern tighten the stake from curiosity to stewardship; closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the corridor “sighs,” reweighting Mara’s vocation. Cost is felt—she shoulders eternal witness—but the causal link between detecting the pulse and choosing lifelong custodianship is compressed into one reflective paragraph, blunting the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as genuine Conceptual Repricing: “mirages of hope rather than grief” reweights the entire ritual and charges the final image of cloth-wrapped mirrors. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of encoded lullabies, prism light, and heartbeat pulse thickens until the smallest mirror’s vision crystallizes meaning. Causality is intact—each vigil is because of the borrowed pulse, the final wrap is because the vision re-priced her stance. Cost is felt in bodily exhaustion and the unspoken admission that tomorrow’s return is also a life-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mixed soil and seeds crystallize a fragile shared practice whose cost is the irreversible past still carved on the clipboard.  Causality holds: the seventeen-year celestial window forces tonight’s choice, and the recovered ritual text motivates the planting.  The lens is cleanly causal—each beat narrows options until the final promise to “return tomorrow” forecloses indefinite hatred.  A hairline slip: the clipboard’s shift from catalogue of defeat to ledger of possibility is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible micro-gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each paragraph layers density—salt, cracks, quantum device—until the release reweights the entire sculpted absence. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dove’s fractured call rings out while rain dissolves the map; cost is felt in the same instant beauty is rescued. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism-light she now carries inside visibly reweights every prior performance; the guards’ flinch is the felt social cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each echo she harvests intensifies the density of her stance until the final crystallized poise. Causality is internal but coherent: because she untangles the threads, therefore the sanctuary manifests and her identity is recast. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and paid off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frozen tableau reweights the premise—uncertainty as gift—while the drunk’s returned stick and the audience’s “peculiar quiet” let the cost reverberate. Causality is situational/accumulative; no single because/therefore hinge snaps, yet the pressure of the argument and the stick’s circulation accumulate to crystallize Marcus’s stance. The lens holds, but the partner’s exit is off-stage and the drunk’s intervention is coincidence that merely complicates, not resolves, so the tightening is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of orange wings against orange sky reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the last migration carries its own ended future. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through moth-wing knots until the spiral crystallizes meaning, and the price (Sera’s transient rootedness, the structure’s three-week lifespan) is visible on the page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or causality breaks occur. The tightening is singular yet sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: bronze cooling in ice-cold air while aurora light projects the first cast names across the sanctum walls—sound made visible, cost made legible. Causality holds: each punch of the card is a because/therefore response to the rope’s decay; the accumulation of seven names tightens the clock and forecloses the fantasy of instant restoration. The “snowmelt ardor” tone shift at the end reweights the premise—spring outside, but perpetual winter inside—so the conceptual cost (decades of solitary transcription) is undeniable even though the emotional price is still being paid.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story lands a clean Conceptual Repricing closure: the rule-set reverses—paths dream walkers, not vice versa—delivered in a charged cadence with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “finding by not seeking” and storm timing tighten the stake without because/therefore turns. Orientation is swift; lens holds. The only drag is the dream-transfer beat that softens protagonist agency; luck, not decision, triggers insight, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single causal chain—tile discovery → schematic decoding → recognition of impossible heliocentric POV → covenant claimed—holds cleanly; each step tightens the stakes of intellectual possession. Closure is a Charged Poise: the morning-star image reweights prior beats and forecloses surrender to any coming regime. Persistent constraint (scarcity of paper/candles) shapes every tactical choice. A 0.3 reserve because the “ancient astronomers couldn’t possibly” realization is told more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken pin stays broken, but its meaning flips from evidence of betrayal to evidence that the music can stop yet the program remains. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—reality’s shifting walls intensify the emotional density until Marcus accepts release. Cost is legible in the sob that “breaks the sanctuary’s silence,” a sonic violation that proves the internal shift is real. No orientation drift; first 80 words plant who-where-when cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: dream escape → mirrors as counter-instrument → synchronized breathing → capture → burial all link because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mirror-on-grave image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—boundaries restored but at the price of eternal vigilance. No causality breaks, no orientation debt; cost legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Mara broke deciduous vows, Lisel fled; because Mara climbs, she can offer the unfinished eye; because the eye’s imperfection is embraced, a new joint apprenticeship becomes possible. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cathedral stairs, orchard rumor, granddaughter’s ribbon). Closure is a Charged Poise: the same tools that once divided them now bridge generations, with the cost visible in the fractured eye they still must grind together. Persistent constraint—the ribbon tying their wrists—shapes the final image and forecloses return to the old Guild order.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mara naming herself on the tree reweights the premise that curators are pages in a non-chronological book. Cost is felt—“quiet in her chest…waiting for the right time that had already passed.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (“simply complicated”) and paid off. Orientation is clean by line 5; lens held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mountain’s whispered twelve extinct languages crystallize Mira’s acceptance of endless disturbance, cost felt in her returning to translate again. Causal chain holds—traveler’s tear → diary research → harmonic linguistic bridge → students released. Orientation is swift: “Tuesday…Codex Mountain” anchors who/where inside 40 words. One minor scaffold: “She smiled” paragraph restates rescue philosophy already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden rewrites her name-tags, making identity negotiable at undeniable cost—she drops the card, forfeiting singular self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog thickens, memories rewrite, carousel horses accrue menace until the final image reweights reality. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by word 60, well under the 120-word threshold. The only causality hiccup is the leap from “telling tales” to literal portal—nevertheless, the pattern of narrative-as-method is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: 3:47 hiccup → door → seal → rope pattern → timeline merge. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged registry and new notebook entries make the before/after legible, paying the conceptual cost of ontological doubling. No teleporting props, no outline drift; every artifact is pre-planted (thermos, seal, rope). The moment she steps back at 4:23, the world’s gain is her loss of singular past—cost is visible in the fresh ink she didn’t author.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush reweights the caves’ reality and leaves the mapkeeper drained, a visible cost. Causality is soft—ice-crack “language” → vocal sequence → bloom—but the pattern is taught early enough to read as Accumulative/Textural logic rather than hand-waving. Orientation is clean within 120 words; spatial and temporal anchors hold. The lens holds without contradiction, but the bloom’s mechanism is slightly abstract, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each motif (hum, crack, star map, thistle seed) layers density until the repaired prism reweights the dominant stake—meaning survives collapse. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant the fracture seals, the pavilion’s hum harmonizes and the future beam is promised, with the conceptual cost that Mera’s own silence is now gone. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glass humming pavilion”), well inside the 120-word waiver window. One soft spot: the engineers’ whispered phrase “shard of hush” is imported without prior textual seed, a micro convenience that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: her final “remembering remembering” reweights the whole quest—archiving is not preservation but endless re-sculpting of self. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lightning flash, shadow angle, and recited fragment layers density until the last line crystallizes the cost—tomorrow she will already be someone else. Fog’s unpredictable state and the notebook’s coming fade are persistent constraints shaping every tactic. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is legible: mosaic note → “make your own” → fireworks barrage → cracked hopelessness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—people still hopeless, but light now carries a reweighted social cost. The price (“fortress had changed…cracked”) is visible in the commander’s wet eyes, satisfying the cost test. Minor slip: the launching apparatus appears without setup, a teleporting prop, but it does not break the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide’s imminent return reweights “pause” from loss to shared threshold, felt cost in Mei’s relinquishing control. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—shell-crab, cicada, and tide build density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Causality intact; the aunt’s surrender grows sideways through observed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gilded hush is physically harvested, re-weighting her father’s bunkered world. Causal chain is thin—flower sprouts because water was spilled earlier—but the pattern is taught early and the hourglass of inversion gives the beat its cost. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers quiet images (gondola, prisms, crystals) until the final hush “vaults” upward—an earned intensification rather than causal reversal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the man leaves lighter, Mara returns to her log, cycle renewed; the cost is her perpetual emotional absorption. Orientation beats land by line 6; no debt. One paraphrase loop (“seven years… seven minutes”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is immaculate: the ruby shard’s homecoming reconstitutes the throne and re-prices Vess’s mission from possession to stewardship; the sunrise image makes the cost (eternal vigilance) undeniable. Causal chain holds throughout—pixel waterfall → orchard → mural → stair → throne—each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“the canyon’s edge”) and never loosens. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative design tightens into a conceptual repricing that reframes every layer of paint as eras of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ash, starlight, and doorknocker accumulate a charged void that crystallizes when Sienna steps across. Closure—shared ignition of the phone—offers Charged Poise, cost legible, though the causal “why now” for Maya’s pivot is elided, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: spam → bolt arrival → threshold encounter → volunteer → bodily anchor. Mosaic shards (cellar, fault-line glimpses, cosmic negotiation) are taught by 25 % and cohere under a causal lens. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: bolt fused to sternum, luminous spore-cloud stabilised. One warp: the narrative skips how she deciphers “threshold” location—encyclopedic presence feels hand-wavy, but not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the safe opens not to gold but to moral absolution, reversing four generations of perceived failure. The causal chain—crank → standing waves → hidden panel—remains tight under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each tonal pulse thickens the dust motes, reweighting the stake without dialogue. Orientation is swift; “first yawn of evening” anchors time and the sepia room by line 3. The only drag is a mid-scene lull while Mara “muses”; trimming one reflective sentence would clear 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration charged by cost—she forecloses her exile and claims the night as canvas. The causal lens holds: each unsnap tightens possibility under the program’s diagrams; orientation is anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the button pinned to the desk lamp re-weights the entire archive—soldier J’s erased kindness is now physically and narratively irrecoverable part of the city’s record. Causal linkage holds: each discovered document tightens Sarah’s options until the only ethical move is to create the counter-file. Orientation is secured by word 80 (“Philadelphia Foster Care Bureau, six months after Andersonville”). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the dust-to-button pattern accumulates density then crystallizes meaning, paying off with undeniable social cost—J’s court-martial remains irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: key → puddle-map → hidden archive → upload → escape, each beat tightening the noose. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the transmitted memories reweight the city’s reality—cost is legible in the Bureau boots overhead and her exile into the lagoon. One minor causality bump: the courier’s riddle is introduced late yet instantly decoded; still, it doesn’t break the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s “saxophone heavy with new purpose” crystallizes a lifelong path foreclosed, cost felt in the body. Causal chain holds: because she hears the prophecy → therefore she weaponizes negative space → therefore the hush is re-vested. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is achieved by word 80 at the pier; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts by density of silence rather than external reversals, pattern taught early and held to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seed, monument, and leaf-transformation adds density until the moonstone catalyzes a pattern-break that reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Nothing stayed fixed” revalues the entire prior sorting quest and forecloses the old interpretive method with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (“the hush where past meets prophecy”) arrives by line 4; the later disorientation (leaves fall upward) is taught early and pays off at closure, so Orientation Test is waived. The persistent constraint—only transformed leaves carry meaning—shapes every micro-choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the compass rose among her tools reweights every prior 3:47 clock from puzzle to witness. Causal chain holds—pattern → coordinates → conservatory → fountain → stairs → shrine; each step is a because/therefore linkage visible on the page. The −0.2 restraint: the admiral’s letter is read once and never re-enters causality, so the price feels partially off-stage. Still, the persistent constraint (clocks will keep arriving at 3:47) is cemented in the last sentence, satisfying the 9+ quick test for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael vanished during her experiment, therefore Mira redeems by re-enacting it with her own named gold. The mid-scene kintsugi mechanics are taught early and repay at closure when golden scars literally mark both forge floor and Kael’s skin. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (rain-stopped foundry, wet rafters, cold anvils). Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Mira’s identity is permanently fissured—her wedding ring is gone, her apprentice is back but changed, and the coin is now inert—creating a Resonant Reconfiguration under Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of “laughter threaded through tears” conceptually re-prices grief, with the gorge chorus permanently minus one voice—cost is audible and felt. Causal chain holds: damaged harp → wrong-note filter → memory prompt → ghost laugh → release; each step is because/therefore. Orientation anchors who/where/when before word 120; misaligned harp and “spectral confessions” teach any necessary disorientation early. No teleporting props; the tooth is introduced, withheld, then wielded exactly where its bite-metaphor pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each beat layers sensory data and remembered pain until the forest’s glow reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—mercy becomes a transform of cruelty, not its opposite—charged by the final strap-touch. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secure within 40 words. Cost is unmistakable: the pewter stays, perception remains hyper-calibrated, and “penance for today” concedes tomorrow’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain—lens fragment → hidden map in paintings → proof of erasure → plan to confront Guild—lands a clean Conceptual Repricing closure: the Guild’s “clean narrative” is now unavoidably cracked, and Mira inherits a visible constraint (the technique itself). Orientation is swift, the single transition (market → workshop) is legible, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: ghost appears → mainspring found → ceiling map read → box retrieved → truth released. Each step is because/therefore, no coincidence resolves conflict. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elevator exhales, photos secure, ghost fades—cost is the lifelong secrecy Marcus now shoulders. The mainspring’s earlier mechanical grip and final loosening frames the before/after with felt, conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library “learned to breathe” and drifts instead of locks position—cost is legible. Causality, however, is soft: the bottled whisper acts like a universal solvent that converts antagonist ideology without resistance or backfire. Orientation is swift and coherent; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to end. Still, the decisive shift is narrated, not dramatized through a final embodied beat, keeping the score under the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored corridors, storms, and shard-glimpses layer density until the final overlap image reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by line 10; the single transition (storm-to-stillness) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—past and present silhouettes fused in the glass—carrying conceptual cost: humanity’s narrative forever pierced by prior beauty. The persistent constraint (covered mirrors) shapes every beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each box restored layers density until the braided dawn chorus reweights covenant vs. corrosion. Closure is a Charged Poise—Cornelius exits up-spiral, boxes still singing below, fatigue and contentment co-present—so cost is felt without tidy resolution. Orientation anchored inside 80 words; single scene, one meaningful tightening (silent → silver lullaby) drives the cadence shift. No causality gaps; metaphoric logic stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: scent motifs tighten from factory petrichor to cavern “stone tears,” re-weighting stakes without causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she seals vials of anti-commodity scent, foreclosing synthesis forever; cost is the compass abandoned to darkness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor causal elision: how she instantly recognizes the lagoon as the compass’s destination reads as accepted psychometric logic rather than gap.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the storm, slide, and coordinates layer meaning until a pattern break (ditching GPS) reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the sculpture will “stand until the next great storm reimagines it”—with conceptual cost legible in that acceptance. Causality holds: slide → new method → beach found → work begun. The Orientation Test is passed by word 50; no lens ambiguity at end. A 0.3 deduction because the “turbine-hum” metaphor is repeated four times, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal light-density and postcard pattern tighten until the rose-window etchings reweight the premise. Closure is Charged Poise—the pavilion panels now carry a living double-image whose cost is the permanent loss of noon-time brilliance. Orientation anchors who/where/when within first 100 words; no penalty. Causality intact: because she traces the hidden etchings, therefore she repaints her own medium. Cost is legible in the final image of “soft shadows holding their own luminescence.”

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s hands spell WITNESS TESTIFY REMEMBER, a Charged Poise that reframes her archival distance as moral obligation. The diary’s consciousness-transfer rule is taught early and paid off at the lagoon; the lens is Causal (decoding → possession → obligation) and holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—she can no longer be a detached keeper—so the ending satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: refusal → discovery → memory transfusion → bottle-crack → reimagined town. Each step tightens options, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing that makes the “library scattered across the wind” both cost and promise. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The –0.3 reserve is for the slightly telegraphed epiphany—“she understood now”—that momentarily explains rather than dramatizes the turn, but closure still carries felt cost under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the silence of the foghorn seeds a pattern of archival loss that tightens when the wax warms and the tree answers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard’s new “archive” in wood and memory—priced by Miriam’s vow of guardianship. Causality holds: the child’s 1907 slip → tonight’s recitation → tree’s pulse. One minor scaffold: “She understood then why she archived…” could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the vortex closes, entropy stays un-reversed, and the single seed becomes the new metric of time—earned, not borrowed. Causality holds: every beat flows from the theft → vortex offer → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (icebound atrium, starlit dome). The “texture of borrowed time” refrain pays off in the tactile ice-grain under her palms—cost is felt in that image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bell-rope becomes a new warning system and Mira’s public stance crystallizes with undeniable social cost—she can never return to mere “testing.” Causal chain is clean: glued rope → vibration discovery → inversion sensing → silent toll → sanctuary saved. Lens is causal throughout; every beat is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the final foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance shifts from penitential exile to participatory witness, crystallized in the singing that answers the birds. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor trace and lantern refraction thickens the pattern until the flawed glass re-weights the premise. Causality is interior but legible—because he keeps tracing, he sees the refraction, therefore he revalues his brokenness. Cost is present in the ongoing solitude he embraces anew, now consciously chosen rather than suffered.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the list reweights Silas’s exile from self-protection to communal witness, visible cost in "bearing the weight." Accumulative lens holds—pattern of ghost keeper’s hive walk → panel sequence → list reveal—each beat thickens meaning rather than forcing causal turns. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by second sentence. Final image crystallizes new custodial identity without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus leaves with new purpose and Chen’s experiential framework, cost paid by the ache of Samuel’s ashes now warm in pocket. Causal chain intact: urn fragment → triggers capsule → reveals Chen’s message → redefines timekeeping. Orientation anchored by 60 words (“emerald silo… prairie light”). Lens held: Causal, because each beat narrows options until only Chen’s anti-numeric path remains.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images (feather, kite, notebook fragments) layer until the snapped string re-prices the rule-set—tethering vs. release—with conceptual cost legible in the final “red prayer of release.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Closure is a Charged Poise: options reconfigured (solitude shared, poems stay unfinished) with felt cost (Maya’s private shoreline now invaded, kite lost). Persistent constraint: the “never quite finished” aesthetic governs every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The secret isn’t domination. It’s listening” re-weights the whole premise with undeniable social/ethical cost. Causal chain—diary insight → copper graft → green mist → cracks halt—holds under Accumulative lens; one tightening beat suffices. Orientation is clean by word 75; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the rain, amber, footprints, and chemical formula accrete into a pattern that reweights “homecoming” as self-recognition. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the equation scratched in dust makes the conceptual cost undeniable—the scientific paradigm she lived by is now a map of her own neural circuitry. Orientation is clean within 120 words; tower, spring rain, and alien contact are anchored immediately. One causality bump: the footprints appear “impossible” yet are instantly accepted without testing or doubt, a tiny motivational slack that nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the owl’s “remembering” reweights the whole act, leaving the garden-to-be swimming with unresolved cost. Accumulative lens holds—each avian cue thickens pattern until the final modulation; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: cylinder arrival → recognition → groove-reading → map-in-leaf → westward journey → reunion, each step tightening options. Orientation anchor (scrapyard, after-war) appears within first 80 words. Closure is a Resonant Re-configuration: the two leaves glow side-by-side, visually costing the years of separation without verbal summary. One soft spot—Crow’s “months of broadcasts” is off-stage causality not seeded earlier, slightly thinning the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the compass rose flash on supernova re-weights “true north” as curiosity itself, sealing the arc with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: temporal density (galaxies bloom/die in paragraphs) tightens until the final crystallization. One minor causality soft spot: the shutdown evacuation is off-stage exposition, but it doesn’t bend the final beat. Orientation anchor (who/where) lands by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the sky’s re-separation and the returning shadow make the before/after legible. Causal chain holds: each piece-swap (cause) triggers a sky-flicker (effect) that narrows her next option. Cost is visible—“the pouch rattled like questions” as she descends—so price is on-page. Lens stays situational: external pressure forces a crystallized stance rather than a plot chess-match.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the gallery itself becomes living archive, the pawns’ walks forever imprinted in stone and air—cost paid in Mara's exhaustion and the survivors’ repeated reliving. Causal chain holds: interregnum chaos → sanctuary discovery → acoustic archive method → final crystallized stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “old parliament's whispering gallery.” No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural pattern is taught early and tightens into the charged poise of the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s final symbol reweights “home” from fixed valley to portable practice, cost felt in the audible quieting of the thunder-grief. Accumulative lens holds: every texture-read memory layers density until the cadence shift (“belonging is what you carry”) crystallizes options. No orientation debt; mountain-bookstore, night-cycle, and three-year span are anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint—language must be touched, not seen—shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the village restarts when Elena utters self-forgiveness, cost visible in her remaining exile. Causality is soft—thread-pull → letters appear → labyrinth solved by confession—more allegorical than because/therefore, but the pattern is consistent with the accumulative-lyric lens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. The price (still exiled, free) is legible, so the ending holds.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira realizes the canyon “amplified,” not scattered, her guilt—an undeniable re-weighting of her premise. The cost is legible in the forged hush and the paint-box she will “never use these colors again.” Causal chain holds: each poem refracts, echoes return sharpened, leading to the single unbending truth she must carry into the ritual. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the soaked jeans and un-looked-for mirror-loss literalize “I’m inside the moment now,” re-weighting every prior frame. Causal lens holds: because she mis-turns, therefore she finds the cave; because she stays in the water, therefore she forecloses detached painting. Cost is legible in one sentence—“ruining her clothes and her carefully maintained remove”—and the constraint (no mirror, wet clothes) persists into the next gallery request.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens: because Silas is dying and gives the vial → Mara opens it → garden scent strips armor → Mara whispers apology → Vera hears. Closure is Charged Poise: the whispered “I’m sorry” reconfigures seven years of silence with felt cost (Mara’s “impossibly small” words). Orientation is anchored by line 3—cobalt lighthouse, dawn, cork vial. No lens ambiguity; each beat tightens options until the final whisper forecloses the shout-stance forever.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patchwork navigation system endures, hydraulics still broken, daughter still gone—cost is the ongoing vigil itself. Causal chain holds: each midnight call → map consultation → censer touch → guidance given; the final image reweights earlier beats without tidy resolution. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by density of ritual and holds through the last star-pulsed line.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the glass eye’s click shut reweights the entire premise—empathy is no longer compulsory—and the cost is legible in her solitary descent. Causality holds: because she cannot lie, she must isolate; because she finds the relic, she can occlude; because she occludes, she regains agency. The Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: each mention of storm, root, or banned text thickens the texture until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (rope bridge, oil lamp, cot) are fixed early and return charged.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is clean: a Charged Poise moment—the dropped Edelweiss—reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (permission to forget). Causal chain holds: because the memories hurt, therefore she releases them. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One tightening at the Anna reveal narrows options neatly. Cost is legible in the final image, though the prior exposition is slightly front-loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the creek rises, ants march; because ants march, Marcus follows; because he follows, he must choose. Each beat tightens options until the door’s opening is the only remaining act. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the shop and all its unvisited worlds are abandoned in that step. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: dreams → collapsed messenger → dawn climb → cobalt grotto → firefly revelation → return with purpose. The Orientation Test is passed by line 5; lens stays situational throughout. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bleeding starlight re-weights her rule from fatalism to agency, felt cost visible in “harder, clearer, more dangerous.” Only a hairline slip: the old woman’s entrance is unmotived teleport, not earned by prior cue.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: together they commit to bottling sight itself, a conceptual repricing with felt cost—Kael’s sight clock and Mira’s abandoned commerce. Causal linkage holds: because he is going blind, therefore she gifts memory-suns; because she left to commodify, now she returns to salvage meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 6; no penalty. Lens (Hybrid→Causal dominant at end) is stable. Minor slip: “six-month” blindness datum arrives in dialogue without prior plant, but it narrows, not breaks, options.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “There was always more chaos to distill” crystallizes the eternal loop with visible cost—she will keep writing, keep losing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scroll-after-scroll reweights stakes without requiring causal plot turns. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and stay legible. No meaningful causality break; all impossibilities are premise-accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s perceptual lens re-prices her loss, foreclosing the “disability” path with felt cost in the final line. Causal chain holds—screw recognition ⇒ backstory ⇒ conceptual shift—under a dominant Accumulative/Textural lens; the fog-lifting image reweights earlier stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by word 60. No lens ambiguity or off-stage resolution; cost is legible in “weight…differently now.” Persistent constraint—smell gone—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal spine is immaculate: grandmother’s superstition → breath-frost realization → scar-map rune → master’s approval, each because/therefore link tightening options. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rock sways, storms gather, Kael’s scars glint “like captured stars,” reconfiguring stakes without declarative summary. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no props teleport. Persistent constraint—public scars—shapes all future scholarly identity; cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle on Schubert charges the final image—truth can beautify or poison, and Mira’s relinquishment reweights the premise with social cost. Drive is Accumulative/Textural; cadence thickens through recurring tree/music metaphors that culminate in the charged hush. Every beat advances pattern without causal gaps; orientation anchors by line 5, well under the 120-word allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of recursive language mirrors the spiral concept until the final breath collapses distance. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise—“the walls began to thin…all spiraling toward the same center”—that re-weights every prior image without explanatory dump. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but repaid when the architecture’s illusion-gradient becomes the literal path. One causality hairline: the dictionary’s second fall-open is narratively convenient, yet its placement at a six-corridor junction spatially justifies the micro-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pendulum’s pause re-weights every prior drip, proving clocks track attention, not time. Causal chain holds—blowing whistle → hour wait → backward count → hidden mechanism → perceptual shift—each step narrows options. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Felt cost is the vertiginous stillness that unmakes her occupational identity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: laser trace → hidden gap → Marcus revealed → Mira’s gate-opening decision, each step tightening options under a Situational lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: “we both need to leave this cave” crystallizes the new social contract and carries conceptual cost—her job security now depends on the man she once tracked. Time, place, and agency are anchored within 120 words; no orientation debt. The only hairline slip is a single explanatory line (“the mushrooms work through relationship…”) that slightly leans toward theme-statement, but it does not rupture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lantern-light transferred from father to daughter reweights the premise—probability is no longer abstract but a shared, living stake in his recovery. Causal chain holds: notebooks discovered → interpreted → syllabus drafted → visit chosen; each because/therefore narrows options toward joint risk. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image (“mathematics wouldn’t save them…might help them understand what needed saving”). Minor time-gap ellipsis between drafting syllabus and receiving text is fully motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mosaic pattern (call → reflection → next call) is taught by 25 % and resolves in the Charged Poise of the final ring: “Right place.” The wrong-number engine is causal: each call accumulates names that Iris later redeploys, tightening the loop. Closure carries conceptual cost: the endlessness of the task is legible in the closing image of her waiting smile, proving nothing ends. One minor scaffold: “The loop had begun” is a touch outline-ish, but the beat lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the walnut-ink card sentence crystallizes a before/after stance with undeniable conceptual cost—“not because they’re all we have against death, but because they’re how we recognize we’ve been alive.” Causal chain holds: locket arrival → jetty return → ink ritual → covenant transformation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Single transition (descent/ascent jetty stairs) is legible and tight. Accumulation cap not triggered; artifact-free at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of moon-lit confession crystallizes options—she stays in the web but now faces it unmasked, cost felt in the hush that replaces banter. Causal chain holds: each rumor-route tightens the noose of obligation until the stranger’s arrival forces the stance shift. No orientation debt; ivy-choked station is fixed by line 3. Lens (Causal) is unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each musical note absorbed is a pattern beat that thickens emotional density until the cadence shift in the silent clearing lands as Charged Poise. Closure is unmistakable—“the hidden center where her love and grief occupied the same coordinates”—with conceptual cost: mapping must end in stillness, not escape. Platinum ring cools, forest resumes song, re-weighting the whole syntax. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by touch within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the double nib catching bent starlight reweights every prior misreading into deliberate plurality. Causal chain holds: pen triggers screen flicker → rewritten signals → settlers adapt → Vera’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is clean by word 60. No teleporting props; the pen’s exotic metal is seeded in grandfather’s box before it alters the console. Cost is unmistakable—she abandons the possibility of ever being simply “right,” a conceptual forfeiture rendered in the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the two women freeze mid-dance under moonlight, having reweighted music itself as somatic rather than acoustic; the cost is the unspoken knowledge that concert halls will never call again. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory translation (ripple = rhythm, wind = tempo) layers until Marina’s body becomes the score. Causality holds: because Celeste insists the camera teaches sight, therefore Marina finally sees her hands as conductors, not pianists. No orientation debt; who/where/when is nailed inside 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: fires → disappearance → breadcrumb hunt → archive → upload plan, each ‘because’ tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ruined portrait plus intact tapestry crystallize both loss and vindication; cost is felt in Marina’s whispered “I found you,” which forecloses her anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece accumulates sensory memory-fragments until the final drumming crystallizes a Charged Poise—Maya accepts the crushing/beautiful load and vows to keep returning. Causality is interior and recursive rather than linear, satisfying the lens. Orientation is swift; the garden, lagoon, and silent-hour rule are anchored by line 5. The cost is legible in the closing image of sore fingers and auroral sorrow, foreclosing the option of letting the chorus fade.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: storm → surveillance blind → smuggler timing → Mira’s key-time insight → server bust. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her father’s vanished union box is now traceable, a social cost that reweights every prior whisper. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and tighten with tablet swipe. No lens ambiguity; the pace folds rather than resets, satisfying single-scene default. Minor −0.1: Inspector Voss’s off-page file fetch is slightly soft, but Mira’s tactical gamble already locked cost, so closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s spoken truth reconfigures the canal’s light-network and her own agency, mirror-to-mirror. Causal chain—guilt → silent patterns → confession → downstream rescue—coheres under Situational lens; coincidence (brother found alive) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is legible in the final image: she stays to learn the patterns, trading silence for perpetual vigil. Minor slack: orientation is complete by line 6, but the guardian’s first mirror angle could be cued one beat sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each window display adds density until the town’s shared gaze reweights. Closure is a Charged Poise: the library board now invites questioning rather than silence, cost felt in the mist that still clings. Orientation beats anchor by line 6; one shard (grotto) is cleanly signaled. Causality is loose but sufficient for this lens; the tightening is the synchronized moment of strangeness that makes conversation bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scrimshaw’s release and whale-dive reweight the premise—grief becomes freedom, the island sinks, Marina walks back “surprisingly spacious.” Causal lens dominates: because the Treaty severed violence, therefore the only combat left is self-forgiveness; because the bone is returned, therefore the false self drowns. Cost is legible in the cold wade back and the vanished island. One hairline slip: the line “furious love… the tender rage” edges toward diagnostic label-speak in the climactic paragraph (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the bouquet’s deliberate disintegration forecloses nostalgic performance and reweights silence as permissible. Accumulative lens holds: each shaved curl and narrated blankness tightens the stake of “permission to feel” without causal reversals. Turbine hum and flower ash are charged with conceptual cost the final hush makes undeniable. No orientation debt; transitions are legible and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal spine is clean: ban lifted → she enters → re-speaks verses → colonnade answers → she writes future. Closure lands as earned Conceptual Repricing: the boundary she “strides through” is the council’s prohibition itself, now reweighted as illusion; cost is implied exile from the grey world she leaves behind. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bent reed’s warbling note and Fen’s promise to “fill this courtyard with beautiful failures” reweight the premise with visible social cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: plant message → Fen’s recognition → vase exchange → new pact. Orientation is swift (courtyard at dusk, post-phoenix ash). No plot amnesia or soft resets. The single tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope, though the reed’s prior setup could be slightly earlier to tighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corrupted sounds are re-valued into testimony, not loss. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the grid stabilizes, the stranger arrives; because Karim stays open, the lens refracts loss into geography; because they co-build, the lab’s purpose is reborn. The miner's lens recurs with rising stakes—first a wrapped relic, then a metronome for layering, finally a golden projector of new meaning. Cost is visible in the predawn exhaustion and the irrevocable pivot from therapy to testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira on the platform, pendant delivered, telescope dome open—options narrowed, cost felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of ash, resin, and paper thickens meaning until the final starlit image reweights prior motifs. One soft spot: the “rock-bottom” paragraph is a 63-word reflective block that slightly stalls momentum; it passes the BRR ceiling but keeps this from 9+. All other beats advance because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rain’s “immutable laws” reprice the entire inherited mystery, making the cosmos Mira’s new lab. Causal lens holds throughout—every card measurement is a because/therefore engine whose payoff is the prediction of cultural fever cycles. The confide moment is the decisive hinge: it leaks the grandmother’s archive to Tobias, externalizing the secret and locking Mira into public accountability. One hairline slip: the tattooed “golden ratio” claim is asserted rather than demonstrated, a micro-loss of proof.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “let this archive remain lost” reweights the entire quest with irrevocable cost. The steadily unpredictable field pattern is taught early, paid off when Maressa must mirror it to activate the atoms, and its hum becomes the story’s final warning chord. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat is a because/therefore linkage from entrance to renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative design teaches its pattern by 25 %: paired recordings → widening detachment → stone counterweight. Causality is lyric rather than plot-dense, yet the tightening lands: the second Lyssa archive forecloses Maren’s belief that documentation can matter. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—her smudge evaporates, mirroring hope’s erasure—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dawn quiet, Prism’s tail curl, and the stacked documents reconfigure stakes with felt cost (career security forfeited). Causal chain is clean—fraud discovery → notebook truth → resignation—and the lens (Causal) holds. One micro-drag: the “three days” tick is told late, so the initial orientation wobble costs −0.2, but the payoff at closure waives heavier cap.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible: distracted thought → sideways miracle → loss of healing → tower study → coffee-ring epiphany → ivy healing. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she accepts an altered gift—and the unfrozen hourglass offers visible cost. Orientation is clean; paragraph one anchors who/where/when by word 40.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear from the first paragraph and holds: each strip discovered layers density until the projector release provides the decisive cadence shift. Orientation is swift—who, where, when anchored by line 4—and causality stays intact (she touches → feels → chooses). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the booth fills with light that re-weights every earlier artifact. Only a micro-gap: the projector switch-on is narrated, not dramatized, so the “felt cost” is luminous but not bodily, keeping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: meteor trajectories tighten into a key pattern, cadence shift from hush to scream to release. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—creativity’s liberation reweights prior silence; cost is the protagonist’s dissolution into threshold. Causality intact: each meteor cry escalates toward archway rupture. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (northern edge, cold granite) arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the single chess-clock tick reweights the entire rule-set—time is no longer frozen, the archive’s schematics are now accessible, and the guard has paid the invisible cost of losing a prior self. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of glowing blooms, lullaby fragments, and midnight stasis deepens until the cadence shift at the final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are taught by line 4 and payoff in the final reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable—“that version of her had known something this version didn’t.”

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the rainforest dissolves into the recognition that the sixth sense is gift not curse, and the gear in his fist is the persistent constraint that will keep turning. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tree he unlocks deepens pattern-density until the cadence shift (“wisdom wasn’t found in the towers…”) reweights the stake with unmistakable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star stamps a memory-layer, tightening the pattern until the card glows. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maya sees the path “visible now, each stone distinct”—a reconfiguration of options with felt cost: she must now guide others. No orientation lapse; fog functions as taught disorientation that clears at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens is accumulative/textural: each latent ash-mark layers density until the silence becomes unbearable, forcing Marta’s sung defiance. The bolt placement on the staircase lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—an earned, visible cost that reweights the fortress’s silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality or prop teleport. Closure image is quiet yet legible: she sings, the stones carry it, the cost of forgetting is now paid in memory and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the rune’s truth reweights Orian’s reality off-stage while Kael pays with her existence, cost legible in “the library exhaled its last breath, and she with it.” Causal chain holds: because she cannot leave, she weaponizes marginalia; because the library dies, the final Chronicle crossing is irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“diminutive titan…tended the ancient temple library”), well within the 120-word guardrail. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at termination.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the atlas page reweights the whole surveillance enterprise, making “recovery” a return to pre-industrial flow, not a kitschy triumph. Causal linkage holds: because she notices the tapping-tide overlap, she reframes the data, therefore she swaps maps—cost is the surrender of her long-used modern overlay. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition and cadence shift rather than external plot reversals—and the lens is taught early and held to the final image. No orientation debt; anchoring (who/where/when) is clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira reframes the rebellion’s silence from failure to “paused,” crystallizing new purpose under starlight. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stone hum + opera-glass reprise reweights stakes rather than causal chain. Cost is conceptual (accepting indefinite wait) and felt through the final barefoot walk home; no contradiction under inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s bioluminescent pulse reweights all prior material and forecloses Lira’s insurgent identity. Lens is Causal: every beat (kite-script, plant-whisper, amber unsealing) is linked by because/therefore logic. Cost is unmistakable—she midwifes a future that may erase her past. One hairline slip: “three days” is summarized, not dramatized, slightly dulling the tightening just before the crack.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pearl of stillness crystallizes while the automated light sweeps “emptily,” repricing her endurance with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each lavender cutting, each freeze counted in waves, accretes until the final breath-echo. The lighthouse keeper obsolescence motif is seeded early and paid off in the empty sweep, tightening the frame. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors arrive by line 4 and remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cracked box stays open, the lighthouse retreats, and the new aesthetic stance carries undeniable conceptual cost (“paint differently now”). Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink’s disappearance reweights the rule-set—time-fracture travel is real and she will follow. The cost is unmistakable in the final line: “she would disappear too, eventually.” Orientation is clean by line 10; the inferred lens is Causal—because the target stepped into ink patterns, therefore Kael will replicate the method. No causality breaks; drone footage and evaporative mandalas tighten options in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain: meteor-letter → recognition → network discovery → activation is lucid, escalating both risk and possibility. Closure is cleanly on-page (“She pressed transmit”), a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the Authority’s reality will shatter. Orientation is swift; broken-dome snow is cinematic by line 3, anchoring who/where. One soft spot: the core’s prior seventeen-year inert carry never poses a prior test; inserting it now feels convenient rather than earned, nudging credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bounty hunter kneels, sheathes the blade, and plants canvas—an on-page stance shift that forecloses the gun path with undeniable cost under the Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric but coherent: each scrap of canvas carries prior stories into soil, pattern taught by 25 % and paid off when father’s knife-silence reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“glass dome… desert rose farm”). No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is clean: the goddess-laugh is caught, silence becomes speech, and the cost is the three-hour night and the risk of being scattered across the garden. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of sleepwalking stars creates density that reweights stakes—and the final image of constellations “stumbling back into their ancient patterns” crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Mira watched from her skiff”), well inside the 120-word allowance. One scaffold: “cool-headed didn’t mean fearless; it meant moving forward despite the fear…” is an explanatory aside that could be cut, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: journalist’s call → contradiction exercise → decision to publish. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the nib’s meaning flips from legacy to evidence, social cost legible in “damage your family’s credibility.” One soft spot: the 1980s-photo forensics are told more than shown, but the contradiction method is dramatized twice, anchoring the turn. Orientation clean by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of preserved/trapped media (amber, firmware, letters) tightens until the amber’s dissolution reweights meaning. Closure—tattooing spiraling timefolds with firefly dust—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lab shifts from tomb to temple, dissonance quiets, cost is the emptied pendant. Causality is lyric but coherent: each artifact returns charged (letters in wet ink, firmware spitting her own infant cry). No orientation debt; anchors (who/where) taught in first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the syncopated breathing at the end reconfigures both women into a provisional family of mutual recognition. Causality holds: the tile fragment’s warmth (physical memory) is the because that lets Isla offer the mandala as forward motion, not nostalgia. The empty-center mandala image lands with conceptual cost—meaning is now the negative space itself. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (spiral sand, echoing drips, mist layers) escalates until silence becomes tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the plaza will bear Davos’s name while Vessa alone carries the contradictory truth, cost felt in the weight of the stolen shard. Causal chain never breaks: retrocognition → revelation → internal conflict → quiet sabotage. Lens is causal throughout; each beat narrows her moral options until the final refusal to speak. Orientation locked by word 30; shattered sky + mosaic cue anchor time and place instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard crystallizes braided timelines, Celeste’s song forecloses her own curtain call, and the Star coin’s final face makes the conceptual cost legible—“perhaps this time her performance had changed a life.” Causal linkage holds: tarot coin touch → synesthetic vision → decision to sing → echo reaches tomorrow’s boy → future sketchbook discovery. The fractured-timeline rule is taught early and paid off when blossoms from three decades bloom simultaneously at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each therefore is a physics or emotional experiment (shock → shared flicker → muscovite trials → diagnostic tool). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “lexicon” revalues loss into public good with visible cost—Maya’s last-frame camera admits the pathway will stay closed for Iris. Orientation clean by 60 words. No meaningful reversals, but one deepening suffices; cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the final paragraph crystallizes Mira’s new function as ocean-cave translator, reweighting her earlier mapping. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than plot-turn driven; pressure mounts through density of image and repeated fossil/ floating motifs until the stance shift is legible. Orientation is swift and atmospheric; no anchors remain unclear. The cost is conceptual—she surrenders prior identity—but the absence of an on-page beat where she actively rejects a former option keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens dominates: snow-code discovery → decoded grid → partner arrival → Berlin decision, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she forfeits anonymity for mission, last image of “silver hush…settling into her bones” conferring permission and loss. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One minor elastic: Marcus’s off-page survival is convenient but complicates rather than resolves, permissible under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the woman folds the papers away, re-weighting the “palimpsest promise” to the simpler, maternal thread—cost is the abandonment of legal leverage, felt in the lighter satchel. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: the fading drip-drip of gutters and thinning fog accumulate until the crossing becomes inevitable; no causal reversal, but a deepening of stance. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene default met. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (river as filter), paid off in final image. Cost is legible in the coachman’s turning back alone—his life’s pattern continues unrewarded, underscoring price.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the oasis’s layered caretaking tightens meaning toward the Charged Poise closure. Causality is lyric rather than sequential; the pattern is taught early and lands with conceptual cost. The “sharp gentleness” repricing is on-page in the final paragraph, reweighting the premise. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse blaze re-weights the lock metaphor—Mira becomes a “locksmith of light,” social rather than mechanical. Cost is visible in the projected fallout (“tomorrow there would be questions, maybe consequences”) and the brass tooth’s warm press against her hip, a tactile legacy now repurposed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: rose→tooth→row→light sequence layers density until the pattern breaks into public radiance; causality is lyric, not transactional, and holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the single transition from alley to harbor is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael places the sundial on the map and chooses to stay, crystallizing independence from isolation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tidal rearrangement and mirrored light reweights meaning—and the price (accepting permanent strangeness) is legible in the final image. Causality remains intact; no prop or rule teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final “prismatic quiet” re-configures Mei Lin’s vocation with undeniable cost—she forfeits her secret archive. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each letter tied = density increase that re-weights stake. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3). The lens ambiguity test is waived because the lyrical pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the signals turn conversational, Mara therefore studies correlations; because she discovers the discord amplifier, she therefore retasks the transmitter. Orientation lands by line 4 (who, basement studio, night of the counter-broadcast). The single-scene structure tightens once when Jupiter’s EM field is worked into the plan, narrowing escape options. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the air thickens, the signals cut off, and the march stops—on-page proof her interference pattern worked, priced by the risk she might have “amplified the tricksters’ power.”

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s retrieval reweights space itself and her own limits, cost paid in the snap-back collapse and trembling exit. Causal chain holds: organ tone → corridor contraction → compass indication → spiral trace → dissolution → key. Orientation anchored by word 40 (starlight, nexus, five corridors). No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural pattern taught early (starlight silver rain, breathing walls) and held to final starlight line.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s portrait of negative space reweights the entire case and her own face-blindness with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds: ribbon discovery → mask-maker insight → empathy gambit. One transition (quarry rim → floor) is cleanly anchored; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—her permanent face-blindness—shapes the final tactic and image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: decoded poems → nail → correction factor → decision to publish through poetry. Closure is a Decisive Change— they commit to dissemination—paid for by Yoon’s renewed risk of reprisal and Mira’s exposure. The single transition up the spiral stairs is seamless, orientation is locked before word 120, and no information teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maria’s stance crystallizes when she pockets the flake and adds the new verse, with felt cost (“luminous disbelief”). Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern of names + song cadence reweights her mission. One scaffold flaw: the glass flake isTeleport-dropped onto the seat with no causal trail; luckily it is later tied to the wrap reveal, so the break is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each stone he sets (“because”) narrows escape (“therefore”), culminating in the earned stasis of staying to break the pattern. The closure image—“breathing with the dying light”—pays the visible cost of forfeiting flight. Minor waiver: orientation (who/where/when) is clear by word 60, well inside the 120-word guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: variable-star pattern → Chen’s solitude → telegram → shared data → harmonic decoding. The telegram’s arrival is the motivated hinge that forces Kove’s confession; the dawn realization reconfigures their future with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Charged Poise: they face “years more” together, path foreclosed from solo science.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: failed mirror trick → Kael acts → seed forces confession → vortex stops. Closure lands with visible cost: “the lake became still, and in that stillness, finally rested” reweights the rule-set (truth must finish). Orientation anchor clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One meaningful tightening at seed-planting beat narrows options to speak or drown. Cost proof test: her gasp and the tree’s groan make price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the crystalline maze reconfigures their collective stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“the living intersection”). Causal chain holds: because they dreamed together, therefore the glade materializes; because they build, they reframe their brokenness. Orientation lock arrives by word 80. Lens is Causal throughout; no timeline or prop drift. Cost is palpable in the shared scar glow and the forfeiture of a normal body.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira and Kael step together into the root-web, accepting the visible cost of “unmaking,” a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with undeniable social/spiritual peril. Causality is causal-lens clean: because she stole Senna’s life, therefore Kael arrives, therefore Mira now risks tearing open the same wound to restore balance. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: who (Mira), where (catacomb orchard), when (night of the burned card) are all lit by lantern and bone-root image. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the tarot cards arrive, burn, and return as motive engines.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcus accepts uncertain expertise and re-starts work; the quarry-echo image pays off the disorientation taught in paragraph one. Causal chain holds—fake Strat → humiliation → cloth test → smaller truth offered → re-commitment—though the woman’s departure is slightly under-motivated, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seed-planting failures → breakthrough holds. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “nothing ends, only transitions” reweights grief. Cost is diffuse (intellectual awe) rather than viscerally felt—keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the scroll’s ink-that-is-water rewrites “preserve” from stasis to cyclical forgetting/remembering; cost is the surrender of linear memory itself. Causal chain holds: dream cue → find creel → smelt stable pages → gear syncs heartbeat → accept tide-self. Orientation is taught early (glass walls, bronze cogs) so disorientation serves, not obscures, the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the report recommendation and self-crowning reconfigure Mara's duty→hope stance with visible cost (she breaks protocol). Accumulative lens holds: each shell/pearl adds density until the final image glows. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; no causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each mapped river and the patched accordion layer density until the final cadence shift ("confluence of before and after"). Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the causality of the bridge collapse is off-stage and recounted, not dramatized, so the decisive change is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mosaic of shifting appearances smoothly teaches its own time-fold logic; by the moment the Librarian names the letter she will receive “in three days,” the paradox feels inevitable. Closure arrives in a single charged image—Elena writing to her own past self—paying off both the cipher and the watch with conceptual cost: she commits to lifelong recursive servitude. Causes hold: every breadcrumb (watch, journal, propagation delays) feeds the final reconfiguration. One causal micro-slippage: “tomorrow” and “three days” briefly tangle, but the loop still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—vision → doubt → sketch → consequence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the act of propagation forecloses imperial safety with exile felt in the final image. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible: “the difficult one illuminated” plus the ferns’ silent applause.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released body carries the infused spark into the dark, reweighting Kael’s vigil. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-build through aurora, static, and ritual—held without contradiction. Cost is conceptual (another life gone, another spark released), but the price is vicarious rather than personally felt by Kael, so the resonance is luminous rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mei renounces private retribution, forecloses vengeance path while charging the final image with conceptual cost—she keeps tending. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of luminous-dark imagery tightens until final “quiet work” re-weights stakes. Orientation anchored by line 6; no teleport props. Only micro-slippage: “three hundred cycles” is told not demonstrated, a hairline scalar issue, not causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: Mara’s shard provocation → Keegan’s fracture → her exit, each tightening his options. Orientation clean inside 120 words; closure is Charged Poise—Keegan left in glowing chimes with doubt now “worn,” cost legible. The paper-order beat is slightly tell-heavy but still forecloses retreat; persistent constraint (his public mea culpa) is implied, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: starlight ripples, stone rings, and magnetic shimmers pattern-build until Maia’s final stone-drop crystallizes a Charged Poise that reweights presence/absence. Causality is thematic rather than plot-based—each stone teaches a micro-lesson that accretes into her conceptual flip—but the links feel deliberate and accumulate visible cost in Keiran’s vanishing body. Orientation is anchored within 60 words via the floating platform, violet starlight, and rainwater pool, so the exotic frame is immediately legible. Closure satisfies the cost test: the final image of simultaneous arrival/departure is an on-page RR that makes the paradox palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: density of echo imagery increases until the final “eternal song” reweights stillness as victory. Closure is a Charged Poise—the arrowhead’s new quiet reconfigures the canyon’s sound-map and confirms the skimmer’s lifelong premise with felt cost: she remains frozen, now sharing the vastness she once occupied alone. Causality is coherent: arrowhead arrival → pattern read in birds → harmonic hum → pulse released. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by sentence three.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s fit crystallizes “lingering luminance” and reweights her self-definition from failed student to keeper-of-wonder; the heartbeat in stone is the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each mist-step and hand-press is therefore-linked to the final accommodation of impossibilities. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Teryn had failed…”) and spatial clarity never wavers. No lens ambiguity; the ending image persists longer than physics allows, making conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gold-green-violet ribbon rises, reconfiguring the entire quest from “solve” to “witness” with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—key tag → archive → journal → luminous vow release—each because/therefore step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens drift. The final harbor-bell amber image pays off the mother’s synesthetic thesis without explanatory blob.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new wavelength harmonizes “deep in her chest,” reconfiguring her purpose with felt cost. Causal chain—coins → frequency → prophecy → witness-role—holds under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One tiny loop: “decisions matter not in their outcomes but in their making” is stated twice; trimming the second keeps 9+ within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atlas, recordings, light-crystals layer density until the final naming reframes the emptiness. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; spatial choreography inside dome stays coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mara leaves with pockets of named fear and the repeated child-voice, reconfiguring her vocation under undeniable cost. No causal break; the telescoping leap to cosmic mission is the only soft linkage, but cost on page saves it.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: drip-pattern density escalates until the cadence itself becomes the turning force. Closure lands as Charged Poise—bell tone that “fell upward” reconfigures meaning and physically restarts the river; cost is felt in Maren’s continuing fragility and the open-ended vigil she assumes. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored within 50 words (“sapphire viaduct…dried canyon…dawn”). No causal breaks; every beat is either because/therefore or pattern intensification; the cracked bell’s breaking is retroactively revealed as conversation with the river’s death, satisfying payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Causal lens holds: drought reveals town → photographs trail → Dutoit store → Mara resists expunging → public arrival. Closure lands in the wind-chime restoration image that reweights the premise: memory will not be drowned again. Cost is legible—“the county threatened to expunge her proposal… the supervisor called her insubordinate.” Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green flame release crystallizes her new stance and carries conceptual cost—she exits carrying “nothing visible” yet everything changed. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the starling pattern, crystal, and flame build density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. One minor scaffold—two adjacent sentences restate the “perpetual dawn” idea—dulls the peak image (−0.2), keeping it just outside the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: radio silence → council challenge → arbor re-check → decision to teach rather than dictate. The parachute-buckle release is the visible Decisive Change that forecloses escape; cost is the lifelong weight she accepts. Orientation anchored by word 30; no later disorientation. Closure image (“leaves whispered agreements”) reweights the premise: authority becomes shared burden. Persistent constraint—three-thousand-foot drop—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Kenji cannot feel, therefore he mis-uses meditation; because he sees the brain as complement, therefore he cedes the suit. The orientation anchor lands by line 4, the tightening occurs when he labels the brain “my complement,” and the final renunciation in court carries undeniable emotional cost—“I felt it—actually felt the tremor.” Closure is a clean Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the legal and existential rule-set is rewritten on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bloom re-weights her business model and refusal of chains. Causal chain is soft—mentor’s posthumous seed arrives without prior setup, growth is impossible, crowds materialize off-stage—but the lens (Hybrid → Accumulative) holds. One meaningful tightening: turning the plant into a live puzzle shifts revenue and strategy. Cost is implied via independence, not felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the household’s silence is pierced, the brother speaks, the mother smiles—undeniable conceptual cost paid. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; each gust of off-key wind layers texture until the limestone itself seems to remember. The final image of Marcus gripping the cord “like a talisman” reweights the entire premise: the tunnel is no longer service corridor but resonant organ. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 3 and hold.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: upright guardian tending inter-dimensional shelves, carrying homesickness as manageable weight. Causal chain: pendant discovery → recognition of boundary logic → voluntary assumption of guardian role; cost is the irreversible loss of her original dimension and name. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of frozen stillness gives way to living mist-library. Light-boundary rule is taught early and re-appears in final image, satisfying payoff; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the staff’s frozen bloom crystallizes the new rule-set—life arises from deliberate rupture, not obedience. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each failed experiment is a density layer whose pattern is legible only at twilight, when the “penny finally drops.” Orientation anchors—who (Maren), where (five-fold ember nexus), when (twilight)—arrive by line 4. Cost is unmistakable: broken hierarchical metal becomes a living spiral whose strangeness is the price of freedom; the ember nexus itself pulses like a heart learning her rhythm, making the conceptual cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene arc lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “shard of hush” reweights the premise—silence is the true signal—visible in the final image of Mira smiling at dawn, grid still dead, city still swaying. Causal chain is accumulative/textural: pattern of tuning deeper into valleys rather than peaks; no abrupt reversals, but the stakes tighten when the moon lens focuses the cosmic hum. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“abandoned radio tower city…”). Closure cost is conceptual yet felt: she forecloses the old interpretive paradigm. Minor slack: fragment’s agency leans toward magical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: sand grains re-appear while forty-seven passengers re-materialize, proving “nothing truly disappears.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (radio frequencies, seat rituals) reweights the stake until parallel timelines collapse. Causality is soft (the grotto channel “opens” without setup), but the final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
    <comment>The empty hourglass and bioluminescent grotto constrain Marcus’s tactics: he navigates by “currents only he seemed to sense” and times the radio broadcast to limestone constellations. Salt-spray, translucent captain, and noon-day stars create a tactile, unstable ferry that mirrors fractured time. Spatial choreography stays clean—seats 12, radio mount, channel in harbor wall track without drift. The hourglass’s final refilling charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each thread-layer thickens perceptual density until the gallery itself reconfigures; closure lands as Charged Poise—the shared pocket of reality is felt, not explained—cost is the gallery’s seizure of her future nights and the brother’s still-translucent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Earned Stasis—Yael elects six-month exile topside, foreclosing her underwater life; chain-link hand-off makes the cost tactile and irreversible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: because/therefore linkage is present (Visitors’ arrival → Yael’s felt obsolescence → decision) yet the primary engine is pattern-reprise and cadence deepening, culminating in the “unfolding horizons” reweighted image. Orientation is anchored within first 120 words (who=Yael, where=Thalassa dome, when=after Visitors). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the hearing-aid silence signals message delivered, and Elena’s live rescue reweights all prior pulses with undeniable cost to Mara’s archive of “quieted devices.” Causal chain—pulse → trace → warning → find girl—holds under the inferred causal lens; no teleporting facts. The “reeling hush” tone answers the twilight rule, offering a Charged-Poise exit rather than mechanical wrap-up. A half-step shy of 9 because the protagonist’s own stakes never narrow; she risks nothing tangible beyond curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: sister’s disappearance → Maya’s return → data download → codex glow. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the tide breach (water under the door) visibly forecloses escape options. Closure is Charged Poise: “Tomorrow she would return again” crystallizes cyclical cost. Persistent constraint (tide clock) shapes every move; cost is conceptual—perpetual exposure to panic—but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Marcus stops counting—an Earned Stasis that costs him his numeric shield and reconfigures survival as acceptance; the porcelain shard embedded in fading ink makes the price visible. Orientation is secure by 120 words (observatory, snow, radio telescope). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: heartbeat tally and ink patterns accumulate until pattern break (stillness) reweights stakes. No causality break; the ghost is explanatory texture, not plot hinge. Meets 9+ quick test except the cost sentence is implicit in image rather than declarative, so caps at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each encoding session adds density to the bone tower, pattern break when birds reveal wave logic, cadence shift in the final hush. Orientation clean by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the last press of the diamond crystallizes options—she will never hear Keshrin spoken again yet has made the world itself speak. Cost is conceptual but legible: the language becomes untouchable texture forever. One minor causality gap: how previous scholars’ madness manifests is told, never shown, so the stakes’ danger is second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain holds: vanished townsfolk → garden phone → Elena’s mother → Elena’s renunciation. Orientation anchors by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—upward snow re-weights the entire premise with undeniable surreal cost. One transition (surface → garden) is legible; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: melody → statues falter → trees uproot is legible, but the orchard’s rules (why music overrides stone sentinels) are declared post facto rather than seeded. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—she leads the mobile grove beyond the city—yet the cost to her (stamina, pursuit, exile) is only implied. The “gap between knowing and understanding” is named repeatedly but never narrowed by a specific irreversible beat. Orientation is fine; the lens holds as lyrical-causal, but the final uplift feels un-taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each object-laden beat thickens the texture of separation until the thunderstorm bottle becomes the charged reprise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the brittle hush settled around him like a blessing”—that reweights the entire premise; cost is the lifetime of pre-dawn absences he must keep mapping. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 6; no penalty. Drone beat complicates without breaking causal logic; ellipsis is motivated. One shard, one transitionless scene, meets scope default.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the manual crank becomes the Decisive Change—song released, ride turning—charged by the halo’s refracted light as visible cost. Causal chain is slim (wrong turn → find ride → restore → sing) but sufficient for the lyric-accumulative lens; the “wrong turn” is foreshadowed by vanished paths, so coincidence is framed, not cheats. Orientation is secured by word 50; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of translucent sheets and interference patterns tightens the dominant stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Stories live in the curvature” reweights the entire premise with felt cost (she abandons the Euclidean quest). Orientation anchored by word 65; no causality breaks; scarf as persistent constraint. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dawn-return + palette-filtered photographs → final decoded note. One clean transition from night desk to cliff; orientation anchored by ferry timetable. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—palette inscription reweights every prior sunrise shoot as two-way conversation; cost is the unending commitment to “keep painting with light.” Persistent constraint (ferry only at midnight/dawn) shapes her schedule and tactics; no causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage holds: because Mara surrendered the lock to the astrolabe-music-box, the room tilts and her epiphany lands with visible cost—tears on her face and a re-threaded ribbon. Orientation is taught early: the key-shaped sign and “three alleys converged” anchor spatial reality before 120 words, so the later spatial warp reads as earned disorientation, not confusion. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hair returned with starlight reweights the premise—fear once caged her, now the same object carries the price of openness. Persistent constraint persists: the symphony “writing itself across her consciousness” is an un-paid artistic debt she must now live.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s palm on the fairy ring recovers memory and reweights her life’s work with undeniable cost—she is “whole again” yet burdened. Causal chain holds: curiosity → return → chart study → ring touch → flood of memory. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the moonlit greenhouse and knee-deep tide ground who/where/when. Lens is Causal; every beat narrows options toward the single irrevocable key-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each shard-touch and tea leaf pattern becomes a because/therefore step toward Kael’s earned exit. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael steps out carrying her own shadow-glass, cost visible in the stilled swing. One causality micro-gap: we never learn why the library allows exile reversal, but the lacuna is minor and doesn’t break the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, color, song) thickens until the seed becomes a palimpsest of worlds. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, wonder preserved—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a sharper physical forfeiture would have pushed it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s release crystallizes Mara’s endless, self-damaging service under the accumulative/textural lens. Causality holds: each loosened knot literally exhumes a voice, tightening her own burden. Cost is legible in the final line—“she added it to her collection”—a charged poise that forecloses rest. No orientation debt; prism sanctuary, starlight, and vault are anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of silence → image → reweighting. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena’s report crystallizes the Whispered Chapel as a living lacuna; the cost is the irreversible exposure of the older foundation and her surrender to partial revelation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“map framer's workshop… beneath the old cathedral”) and re-anchored after the single time-jump (“Working through the night…”). No causality gaps; every image (1957 vs. 2023 footage, spiral grass, exposed stones) accretes toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the log lines re-weight the entire quest by revealing that “letting go” is not an action but a refusal to keep preserving. The causal chain holds—descent → discovery → reading → ascent—each beat changes knowledge; the final image of swirling snow re-cues the grandmother’s question with the price now legible (the ascent itself is the renunciation of treasure). Lens: Causal held throughout; no orientation debt; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip is the off-stage sinking voiced through a document, but because that document is the sought-after transmission, causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images layer (flower press, graffiti, lightning) until the courtyard itself sings. Orientation anchored at once; no temporal warp. Closure is a Charged Poise: the wheels spin faster, the ghost strengthens, her voice “finally found its audience”—cost is the irreversible exposure of her art. No causal contradiction; every beat adds density rather than reverses direction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage is immaculate: because Maren finds the shifting diary, she takes the goggles; because the goggles reveal Thessaly’s preserved joy, Maren’s grief is re-priced and her future path foreclosed to mere mourning. The elevator climb literally and emotionally narrows options floor by floor while the cost—captain hollowed, servant left as memory-keeper—grows visible in each entry. Closure lands on-page in the final image: Maren descending with “proof that someone had noticed her,” a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the stakes of remembering versus losing. All anchors (who, where, when) are crisp by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s “emptiness” is re-valued as active memorial, felt cost in the notebook shut and the word “homecoming.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud-gap observation layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“seventeen thousand feet”), well inside 120-word guardrail. No causality breaks; telescope and gondola states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks out into dawn destruction carrying the warm coin, its invisible engravings now part of her future portraits—an asymptotic promise that reweights the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of mirrored attempts (canvas, coin, tree) tightens once through the custodian’s journal revelation, and the final image crystallizes cost without needing causal reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“4 AM”) and the oak library interior; no debt applies. The ending beat (“The limits we discover…”) is an earned conceptual re-pricing, not an abstract moral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of hopscotch-to-phrasebook symbols → reversal test → ship freed. Orientation is swift—airship name, altitude, three-day strand—well inside 120 words. Closure lands with visible cost: the disappearing golden glow and scattered starlings mark the “before/after.” One micro-turn (backward hopscotch) is sufficient at this length; no causal breaks or off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored corridor reweights her vocation from opener to listener-of-silence, felt cost is the audible gear-heart sync that follows her down the stairs. Causal chain intact: prophecy scraps → mirror test → starlight spill → audible rhythm, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3; no penalty. Lens ambiguity zero; drive is causal throughout. No teleporting props; gears and vial seeded early.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each dawn message adds density until the merchant offer triggers a single tightening that reweights the sharing economy. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the unanimous vote refuses private wealth and the nebula-light image reconfigures their moral rule-set. Cost is legible—“I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY” burns on the plaza—but the ghost’s own stake dissolves rather than scar, so the price is social, not personal. Orientation is clean by line 20; no causal breaks; one shard boundary at “That night…” is sign-posted.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph layers sensory and ontological density until the lullaby becomes structure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the lighthouse still stands but reality is now tuned to maternal rhythm; the dust of the puppet head is the visible price. Orientation is taught by the second sentence (“At dusk, Mara climbed…”) and pays off when dusk returns as the moment she enters the pattern. No retroactive patches; every beat is either adjustment, humming, or dust.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal logic holds: inheritance → trapped caretaker → discovery of nut/blueprint → new escape path → embrace of role. Orientation in first 120 words plants who/where cleanly; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise: Maren’s voluntary return crystallizes options with undeniable cost (“prison,” “purpose”) under causal lens. The cost is legible but abstract—no body price or future consequence dramatized on page—so misses 9+ ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis + foam insight reweights the meaning of “divergent path” so that separation becomes reconnection. Causal lens holds: because she wades into the braided streams, therefore she sees the self-healing foam, therefore she re-enters the lab path. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The final image carries unmistakable conceptual cost—she forecloses perpetual mourning in favor of unfinished notebooks. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the floor becomes a hidden collection that re-weights every future visitor’s step. Causal chain holds: because Mira maps absences, therefore she manufactures slates containing “trace elements of others’ absences,” redefining her product. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (moonlight pools → catalogs grooves → bottles clouded absence) and tightens into final image. Cost is unmistakable: her exit preserves the archive but forfeits transparency—felt in the phrase “the weight the world had learned to release.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coral’s decomposition reweights centuries of remorse into sand, and the fortress stones feel “lighter”—an unmistakable cost to the place itself. Accumulative lens holds throughout; the pacing pools release one emotional vintage after another until the final cadence shift signaled by weeping ice. Orientation is anchored by paragraph 2 (“southern wall,” “rain had stopped an hour ago”). No causal gaps; each touch equals one tasted memory, therefore the next.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clear: insist → retrofit → broadcast → coax response → receive song; each step because/therefore links. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—shared harmony reweights isolation—but the cost is delegated to the collective; Mira pays nothing, weakening the “felt” requirement. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; lens is Causal, held to the end. Biggest drag: the decisive beat (Tigrinya appeal) is oratory, not action, and the tower’s mechanical stakes disappear once the singing starts.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: mirror fracture → new angles → protocol flip. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Maya rewrites theArchive’s purpose, not its code; the cost is the recursive entanglement she now carries. Orientation is clean within 120 words; moonlit canyon, dried creek bed, periscope mirror anchor who/where/when. The final image (spiraling code+dreams) reweights stakes, but the cost is stated rather than felt in a single charged sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: doodle → inversion trip → threshold chamber → planting. The inversion-hour rule is taught early and paid off at climax, so orientation is waived. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the seeds’ future vigilance reweights the archive’s mortality. One minor scaffold loop in “coiling route / coils and chambers” is cosmetic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: stress-crack patterns, wire tension, and grove-wide sway build density toward a Conceptual Repricing—“music had simply changed the instrument.” The ending image of the hedgehog dreaming of unheard sound visibly reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds; no orientation debt; closure is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nexus stabilizes, but Katrin is now bound to an endless, precise stewardship—cost is legible in “pressed her thumb into the dent… smiled through tears.” Causal chain holds: chess demonstration → geometric response → covenant refinement → new living balance. Orientation is clean by word 60; no prop or rule teleporting. One micro-turn (beings re-shape the board) tightens options rather than inflating them. Only the single cliché phrase prevents a perfect 9.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the clasp’s click reweights the entire story’s rule-set—empathy is not protection but witness, and the diary now opens willingly forever. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the tightening is the final frequency “felt more than heard,” which crystallizes options and leaves Marcella in Charged Poise under fireworks. Persistent constraint: once the clasp yields, her prior pacifist method is validated yet charged with the cost of bearing atrocity’s opposite. Cost is legible in the single sentence “She read with tears streaming,” making the reconfiguration undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lirien forecloses flight, pays with three days of nausea, and re-weights her lifelong affliction into mastery. Accumulative lens holds: each journal scrap and doodle accumulates density until the final “wildflower hush” re-prices presence over escape. Causality is clean—no teleporting props or retroactive knowledge. Minor waver: “wisdom had always flowed…like an underground river” is an abstract coda that slightly blunts the image-cost, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: inversion → water clue → echo → canister → council plan. Orientation is swift: planet, skiff, orchard stakes inside 80 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with social cost—family name restored, but risk of council reprisal is implied. One minor slack: the canister’s exact mechanical leverage (how it proves theft) is off-stage, keeping the beat just shy of irreversible punch.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth’s “breathing” reweights the entire mystery from crime scene to atmospheric warning system, cost felt in the humming metal. Causal chain (charts → vortex → evacuation) holds; orientation is swift (Porto Velho day-four). One minor scaffold: “she’d been searching for without knowing it” teleports the wind charts into her path; still, the reveal changes tactics immediately and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal logic holds: because Kael arranges the sculptor’s moment, therefore his anti-performance can unfetter wonder. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the aurora-tunneled hush reweights global perception, price visible in the cavern’s necessary quiet he must now endure. No orientation lag; ice, bells, aurora located by word 60. One shard only, so default scope met; reflection stays under 20 % and alters present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shimmer reveals entropy, not culpability, reweighting her guilt into witness. Causal lens holds throughout—flute degradation drives the final image; driftwood markers and canyon acoustics are set up, used, paid off. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleports. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “witnessing that passage without looking away.”

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fragment’s destruction binds borrowed emotion into ink, making the operator’s private equation publicly legible at the price of the shard’s annihilation and his last mask. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (star-loss, halo glow, ink bleed) intensifies the central stake until the press pull reweights meaning. The timeline is anchored within 40 words; geography stays tight to the workshop and sky. Pattern taught early: “whose precision he couldn’t say” cues the fragmentary POV; payoff in final “own uncertain hands.” Cost is unmistakable: another star vanishes, walls dim, irreversible simplification looms.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: pendant activation → thickened time → wonder exchange → steadier return. Each escalation is because/therefore; no teleporting props. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses perpetual hurry and the hollowness Orin warned about; cost is felt in the final line where “jittery perhaps” admits the fear endures even as hands steady. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; later spatial cues remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light-absorption culminates in the prism’s blackening and the mist’s answer. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—frost patterns condensing yesterday’s grief—reweights stakes at the arbor. Closure is a Charged Poise: the arbor as living battery and Mara’s stance crystallize simultaneously; cost is the irreversible darkening of her tool and the inheritance of covert practice. Persistent constraint: once the prism drinks sorrow, rainbow demonstration is gone forever—tactics already shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tapestry lifts, she pays with “the essential warmth that had kept her breathing,” daughter receives knowledge—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each shuttle pass thickens pattern and stakes until the seventh-day cadence releases the message-mist. Cause-and-effect is internal (memory → puzzle edges → loom bridge) rather than external, but the piece teaches that logic early and pays it off in the final image of the dimmed amber bead.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal through-line is immaculate: silk threading → crystal map → seven stakes → hammer strike → planetary shudder → memory wipe → bloom. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the planet breathes while Kael is emptied, an undeniable cost legible in “he couldn’t remember who he’d been.” Orientation is clean by 90 words; lens is taught early via mapping montage and held to the azure-petal final image. Accumulation of sacrificed memories acts as persistent constraint shaping tactics—no amnesia convenience, all swaps pre-agreed.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s pulse and “engines beginning to sing” crystallize a new apprentice pact with visible cost—Kaia surrenders her solitary exile. Causal chain holds: shard heat → universe-hop → mother-offer → choice. Orientation is taught early via sensory coordinates; the mosaic of universes is legible. One minor slack: the pocket universe appears only at the end, so the rule-set is revealed rather than tested earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each letter-and-stone accretion reweights the stake until the darkened lens reveals years of etched pleas. The closure is a Charged Poise—Vera pocketing the sea-glass and vowing return—crystallizing her new stewardship with felt cost: perpetual solitude chosen to keep guardianship alive. Causality is lyric rather than event-based, but the pattern is taught early and closure re-prices the rule of the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image of green dawn light “shaping everything new” crystallizes a Charged Poise—Mara’s stance is unchanged, yet the reader feels the conceptual cost of her endless stewardship. Causality is associative rather than sequential—storms, ships, prophecies accumulate until the beam reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors within the first 120 words (emerald lighthouse, keeper laughing, star-scattered sky). No teleporting props; the glass wick’s physics is foreshadowed early and paid off in the final beam. Cost is legible in the closing line: she records prophecies “no one read anymore,” a quiet forfeiture of recognition that forecloses an ordinary life.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the morpho wing on the sill re-casts her vigilance into service, with conceptual cost acknowledged. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pattern of strangers’ confessions tightens until stance crystallizes; proprietor’s reveal is the causal fulcrum that re-weights her role, not an external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael reassembles the sextant into a moon-prism, crystallizing new options—labyrinth will now hold “what trees remember,” not just human sorrow. Causal chain: pin-fall → door opened → sextant touched → wound healed → astronomer’s map decoded → beam re-configured; each because/therefore tightens. Cost is visible in her exhausted dawn descent and the irreversible shift in the labyrinth’s function. Orientation anchored by word 60; lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final sunrise lands on the page, Elara’s last fragment vanishes, and the conceptual cost—she binds the world only by unbinding herself—is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: lullaby → shard-gather → dawn-pull → community-song → her extinction. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“In the mirror world…”) and the mica window anchors space throughout. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern tightens to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the amber-lit library and creased invitation reweight solitude from prison to portal, cost legible in the now-permanent monthly descent. Causality holds: mis-delivered invite → descent → reading → reframed empathy → public re-emergence. Orientation anchored by word 42. The sole drag: the society’s “keepers of paradox” tag arrives late and slightly abstracts stakes, nudging the lens toward mild Hybrid ambiguity at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: creeping vegetation and disappearing storefronts accrete until the tea-house shard delivers the pattern break. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira pockets the blue-wrapped bread beside new seed packets—visible conceptual cost, new weight to ordinary acts. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; one clean transition from courtyard to tea-house. Causality is loose under lyric design, but pattern taught early and closure reweights memory vs. erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: density of decaying wonders builds toward a conceptual re-pricing—turning archive into seed. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; single POV, continuous scene, one meaningful tightening when she converts vows into transmissible code. Closure lands as Charged Poise: capsule falling, library doomed, Celeste inside the collapse yet having already paid by releasing the future; quartz-hush cadence makes the cost felt without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each false rumor acts as a tagged probe; only the north-caves lie reaches the revenue men, tightening the noose around Kern. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—Della presses STOP, forfeiting hard evidence to spare a daughter—made legible in the single sentence “Go get Sarah.” No orientation drift; who/where/when anchor inside 120 words. Persistent constraint: the sunrise clock visible in “dying stars” makes the mercy window irretrievable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass re-orients from magnetic to “invisible architecture” and Kaia offers it away, foreclosing her past worldview. Causal linkage holds: each tasted metal predicts a carrier’s arrival, tightening anticipation. Accumulative lens dominates—density of aurora, elections, carriers, and ring-spin converge into a single charged image. Cost is legible: she surrenders both heirloom and skepticism, accepting “luminous acceptance” as irreversible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya accepts the gallery but the cost—exposing her buried grief—remains visible in the smudged frame. Causal chain is tight: docent’s discovery → confrontation → offer → ascent. Crystalline cave as hidden studio is anchored by ~120 words; no orientation debt. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows her options until refusal becomes impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to carry the Archive outward reweights the premise—truth becomes portable, no longer sequestered. The cost is felt in the toxic sky still pressing above and in the implied social risk of circulating honesty; the final line’s restored inscription delivers the conceptual bill. Causality holds: fragment → map → depot → first etching → resolve to broadcast, each step a because/therefore linkage under the Causal lens. Orientation is seamless—who/where/when anchored by line 20—and the single transition from studio to depot is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the sculpture’s slow tonal accretion is a single, continuous scene whose pressure mounts by density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when inside 30 words). The decisive change is the crystalline ice’s vanishing, reweighting the bells’ song from private ritual to communal artifact; the cost is the literal loss of the fragment and Mara's yearly surrender of voice. Closure lands with Charged Poise: the final note hovers, foreclosing any chance to repeat the same wonder, yet the gathered listeners carry an irreversible after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the android re-prices “north” as internal, not geomagnetic, and the cost is the burned farm and the vanished crayon label. Causality is tight: the magnetic lurch → static → need to miniaturize → controlled burn → self-partitioning. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate sensory disorientation (“vision stuttered… roses pulsed”) pays off when the same fragmentation is re-engineered into a survival tactic. Final image—android humming while replanting—crystallizes new options with undeniable conceptual cost: home is a direction you code, not a pole you find.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: Iris re-enters courtyard community; cost is her raw sobbing and the visible pile of ignored letters—Charged Poise achieved. Causal chain intact: locket→address→mailbox→Iris. Orientation anchored by l.60; no ambiguity. One soft spot: mailbox payoff is off-stage (they “went to the basement,” scene cut) blunting Decisive Change image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the rusted locks “recognize” her dance and open, re-pricing captivity as a mutable pattern. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than thriller-tight—each journal entry, dice roll, and dance phrase layers until the environment answers—but the lens is declared early and held. Cost is on-stage: she relinquishes her elaborately built prison-algae and the safety of encoded secrecy. Minor over-cleanness in the final uplift keeps it just shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maren’s recovered memory proves “nothing was ever truly gone,” a rule-shift that retroactively revalues every vanished moment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of salt, coffee, and crystallized images accretes until meaning warps. Orientation is clean: “Tuesday… dock lanterns” anchors who/where/when inside 30 words. The only causality wobble is the unmotivated leap from “coffee ground fractal” to “method for reading spacetime,” but the missing bridge is brief and doesn’t fracture the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: wing → trace → trade hush → blur journal → dust. Closure is Earned Stasis: world saved, her solitude deepens; cost legible in the final smile of ignorance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn (wing crumbles) tightens the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each Thursday tea accrues knowledge that narrows the narrator’s ignorance until the only remaining option is to confront the lie; the meteor-shower rooftop supplies the visible constraint (cosmic time vs. immortal time) that forces the decisive question. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the narrator steps from protected pupil to apprentice of eternity, cost felt in the line “Some borrowing…was never meant to be returned.” Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (door knock, old building, sugar request), and the Byzantine seal’s provenance is foreshadowed early enough to avoid retroactive patch. No plot amnesia or convenient resets.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s discovery that quarantined memories can sing back as living seeds crystallizes options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the seashell-flower duet is foreshadowed by the whispered resonance—and the final image reweights the archive from mausoleum to germinating garden. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the reader feels the shift yet not a palpable personal loss in this beat. One tightening turn suffices; orientation anchors arrive by word 70; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each drip, aurora shift, and pigment stroke layers density until the forged decree reweights history. Closure is Charged Poise—the thorn embedded in marble, document complete, kingdoms “unlink” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; causality of pigment-ritual to imperial authenticity is tight. No lens ambiguity; cost is undeniable in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s dual-voice harmony crystallizes her guardian identity while the nexus reverberates with undeniable new cost. Causal chain holds—seashell cue → split voice → self-revelation—each step tightening options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor orientation lag: “lower passages” geography is assumed, not anchored, but the final image exploits starlight cracks to re-weight meaning, so the waiver applies. The persistent constraint—she now sings two tracks forever—shapes the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the captain’s “windows of connection” are acknowledged, the data’s survival path is secured, and Maya carries “smoke and the captain’s peace” upward—cost is felt in the glacial dark she must re-enter alone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: candle-by-candle density builds until the melted snow globe reweights meaning; no causal reversals are needed. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Only the slightest off-stage convenience (ghost-networked dream reports find her) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s flick of whisk-water patterns the stone, crystallizing her intent to teach, with the firefly/moon/net map as visible cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density escalates through nets, whisk, equations, fireflies—re-weighted in one final image that reconfigures tomorrow’s stakes. Orientation is swift: parapet, after-rain, night whistle within 60 words. No因果 reversal is required; the tightening is the recognition that the girl’s equations already rhyme with Chen’s craft.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is pristine: shredded memo → stillpoint equation → choice to burn. The Orientation Test is waived: the initial dust-flow-around-orchard image teaches the anomaly early and pays off when the stillpoint collapses if the diamond is removed. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: “Some truths… better left buried” reweights her entire vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn fragment tightens density rather than causal chain, and the final “You have always been both the question and the answer” crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (cloudline, cobalt portico, Tuesday ozone). The portico as both pulpit/prison is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and final image. Closure is legible without explanatory dump; cost is felt in her isolation and choice to fall silent.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each jar added thickens the pattern until the composite recording reweights meaning. Orientation is swift—feral loft, dawn, jars of sounds—within 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren walks toward town bearing the wedded recording; the beach’s wistful silence behind her makes the conceptual cost (exposure, self-explanation) undeniable. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the final image crystallizes options rather than changing them.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: key’s growing warmth → discordant ice-song → Kael’s translucent intrusion → Maren’s harmonic pivot. The sunset clock tightens the single scene, while the climax—the moment she hums the complementary overtone—delivers a decisive change that reconfigures both the marina’s fate and Kael’s body. Cost is legible: Kael locked into eternal chorus, Maren forfeits the simpler “release” solution, accepting perpetual maintenance of memorial ice. Closure image of her dark coat against night after amber light offers resonant reconfiguration under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: seventeen winters of mapping → viaduct magnetic window → lunar meridian convergence → exodus beat. Closure is Earned Stasis: freedom refused as wildfire, embraced as glacier, with the frozen lake mirror repricing their prison into a boundary they now own. Persistent constraint—discipline itself—shapes every tactical choice and is visible in the final “softly purposeful steps.” No orientation debt; lens taught by 120-word mark and never loosens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because she finds fresh scratches → therefore she photographs; because fibers mismatch → therefore timeline fractures; because evidence accrues → therefore she must act. The closure beat—“ready to let her findings reverberate”—is a Decisive Change that swaps silence for exposure with career-and-safety cost legible on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One shard, single transition at climb-out; within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain intact: withheld heart → guilt → second opinion → restoration promise → scheduled delivery; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Marcus finally schedules the hand-off, surrendering the refuge of private remorse. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “He walked… feeling lighter” states what the prior image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens: kaleidoscope patterns build density until the final “yearning to understand yearning” crystallizes a resonant re-configuration. Orientation is clean by word 80; the floating workshop and acid sea ground the shard. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Fennec’s journals filling is the visible cost, the bell-unheard-yet reprices her lifelong labor. No causal reversal, but the pattern break is legible and feels final.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: patch photo → disappearances → 2347 trail → null-state discovery → extraction decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “coordinates” re-weight the premise and the cost is conceptual—she will breach corporate walls. One minor causality bump: supervisor confrontation is skipped, so the lie beats lack external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael shows the shard-glimpses, therefore the elders feel the web of debt, narrowing options to “tell us how.” Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the final line “we begin,” with conceptual cost: the ice keeps fracturing, the fragment will never be whole, peace must be endlessly re-constituted. Orientation anchored early (lighthouse orchard, two clan leaders, present dispute). No teleporting props; shard is handled in every beat. Persistent constraint: the ever-shifting ice and the irreparable crystal literalize that any peace here is provisional—this reweights the final gesture under the same metaphoric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open laptop and un-pressed cancellation button reconfigure stakes with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ice sounds, database trawling, and parasol handling accrue until a cadence shift (“in no particular hurry”) reframes the dominant stake. Causality remains intact: because she ferries one family, she postpones her own ending. Cost is visible in the un-pressed button; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: burned fragment → graft metaphor → shared night. Orientation is clean within 120 words: hillside path, amber pavilion, dusk lantern. Closure is a Charged Poise: “we have all night to tend this particular graft” crystallizes options with the cost of family feud and lost city future. Persistent constraint—the feud—shapes every tactic; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: prophet arrives → Maya demonstrates parapet language → consecration offered → sacrifice accepted. Orientation is swift—place, time, and stakes anchored by line 45. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Maya’s consciousness fuses into stone, foreclosing her future; cost is legible in “part of me will have to remain here.” Micro-turn inside the scene tightens when the prophet confirms sacrifice is required, narrowing choices cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative lens: photo arrangement + gathering = pattern that reweights communal sorrow. Closure image—“something had shifted… rearranged into grace”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with social cost felt through collective voice. Causality is interior and cumulative; no decisive external pivot required. The final beat is quiet but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary’s “complete” is re-priced by the crystal’s future-voices; cost is the ideological death of stasis. Accumulative lens holds—each echo thickens the pattern until the final image re-weights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside first 120 words; no debt. One transition (dawn → tomorrow) is legible, coherent, and charges the Earned Stasis she must embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density, chalk marks, and driftwood markers progressively reweight the stake—preserving what slips away—until the final hum reconfigures meaning without killing it. Orientation is secure by line 4; no因果 breaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the chalk line Sarah draws is legible cost, crystallizing that some sounds live only in shared listening. Micro-turn at the arch—capture equals kill—tightens the cadence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: tremor cadence and clock pulses accumulate until a pattern break reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the re-tuned clock becomes a seismograph, Mira accepts unfixable flux—and the cost is legible in the final auditory image. Causality holds: each tremor deepens the stakes for tonight’s lunar transit photos, so the clock mod matters. No late rule changes; orientation anchors (who/where/when) are cleanly in place by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: diagnosis → request → phone campaign → arrival → goodbye. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: father dies with daughter and shard, cost legible. One shard break (three-week ellipsis) is allowed; pattern taught early. Orientation debt waived—cloud-hospice image anchors immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice is tight: spoon-bending → rune legibility → key vibration → hidden chamber → identity rupture → voluntary loop-closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 40 (“The observatory floated three miles above the cloudline”). The final image—Mira tracing “return” while dawn approaches—is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior shadow image with undeniable conceptual cost: she must choose between incomplete independence or integrated self. No teleporting props; the key’s magnetic resonance is set up before the hole appears.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bone constellation becomes a literal gateway, cost paid by Maren’s permanent loss of empirical footing and the changeling’s bodily token. Causal chain holds: substitute body → garden invitation → constellation construction → mutual return, each because/therefore step tight. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is visible in final image: Maren’s new certainty = the map she carries out, a lived tool that will reshape every future diagnosis. Minor time dilation (an afternoon’s work rewrites cosmic displacement) is allowed in fabulist mode and serves the mythic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard added to the wall increases density and softens the surviving option of revenge-by-fire. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mara installs the white-glass lens that will never burn, rewriting the rule-set of illumination. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“serpentine grotto”), transitions are single-state, pattern taught by 25 %. Cost is legible in the final sentence: she “tends her constellation in the dark,” accepting perpetual half-light as price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pendant’s return crystallizes a new equilibrium—Mira keeps her stance, the executive leaves lighter, both futures are legible and finite. Causality is clean: viral confession → sanctuary garden → pendant offer → shared quiet; each beat narrows options without convenient resets. The icicle drip patterns enact an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting meaning at the end without needing causal reversals. Cost is present but diffuse (time, exposure, emotional labor) rather than a single palpable forfeiture, keeping the score just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist chooses to “write the final chapter,” solemnizing fragmentary hopes instead of pursuing reunion; the cost is the forever-absent daughter, legible in the shell pressed to the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of cameos builds density until the stranger’s line reframes the search itself as sacred. Orientation is clean—mist, rocks, three rivers—by word 80. No causal break; the seashell’s spiral re-enters as the charged object that reweights the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through pattern (moon + dawn + songs) rather than causal reversals. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the land “remembers,” the moon fades, and Maera accepts anonymity—conceptual cost is felt. One minor causality wobble: “the land suffered in ways people couldn’t quite name” is asserted, not shown, but it doesn’t break the lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story teaches its pattern early (frozen world → thaw) and lands a Charged Poise closure—the flash-burn that re-weights the map into memory. Causality is interior but coherent: because time stops, she can finish; because the map burns, the world restarts and her path is chosen. Cost is felt in the ash she must now carry in her mind. Minor waver: “heartbeat-matched pulsar” arrives as late rule, but it is paid off in the same breath and does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visit layers new sonic data until the rebuilt timer triggers the resonant reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she forecloses acclaim with the bronze click—cost is felt in the phrase “she alone understood,” though slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry reveal re-weights the task from collection to guardianship, and the cost is the infinite expansion of duty under starlight—felt, not declaimed. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; place, time, and POV remain single-scene stable. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each weight-glow deepens pattern rather than hard plot turns. The lens holds, but the climax is entirely internal image; the causality of “understanding” lacks a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path, so the cost is conceptual more than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the laugh-figure crystallizes here-and-gone under the skylight, reweighting absence as generative; rain, kettle, and blank all constrain earlier tactics; cost is legible in the cold tea and “rust-hued peace” admission.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Chronology is deliberately disoriented but taught in the opening clause and pays off when the wheel re-introduces sequence; orientation debt waived. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each overheard shard adds density until the pattern breaks with the wheel’s first click, reweighting her options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the joined hands reconfigure the stagnant present without false redemption, lagoon reflection as conceptual cost. Persistent constraint: stopped carousel / continuing lagoon underwrites every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: discovery of sextant → mapping flows → redirecting them → community resurrection. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant plaque reweights the terminal from abandonment to navigation point; the visible cost is the irrevocable conversion of departure gates into gardens, but the lens stays Accumulative/Textural—no single decisive act, only steady flow realignment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush, crystals, and violin return in a charged final image that reweights silence from prison to chosen refuge; cost is legible when Maren decides she will “not become the virtuoso” and walks away bearing the instrument “differently now.”

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage is clean: false legend → radio silence → maps hidden beneath myth → salvage decision. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Marcus walks away with the ruined sundial and the truth, foreclosing the treasure hunt. The bent gnomon reweights the premise: time is not to be navigated but mourned. Persistent constraint: the harbour radio’s return mocks the earlier silence, sealing the cover-up.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of rope-knot → fulgurite → awakened seed tightens once with conceptual cost (promise of years of patient work). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren walks toward lights carrying “humanity’s patient wisdom,” final image reweights earlier motifs. Fog-dock orientation is taught early; no teleport, no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Thomas re-grips the thread as compass, Marina forfeits neutrality—cost is legible in the shared hush. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of described absences tightens into one reclaimed presence. No orientation debt; garden and bench anchored by line 5. One transition (garden to bench) is legible and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is sound: tattered robes → egg purchase → clandestine lab → 43-day trial → bioluminescent hatch → father confrontation → charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prince cradles an impossible life-form whose song reweights the palace’s meaning, foreclosing his earlier despair while binding him to perpetual secrecy. Cost is visible—“traded his ceremonial sword,” father’s disgust, the creature’s cage-dependency. Orientation lands by line 4 (who, where, when), transitions are smooth, lens stays situational/accumulative without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the black sand in Marcus’s pouch reweights the entire coin-and-ash motif into fertile ground; the cost is the unspoken truth that Maya will keep grafting others while her own wound stays open. Causal lattice holds: every grafted plant and drilled coin traces back to her father’s arsons, so the final image is inevitable, not convenient. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through repeating acts of transformation rather than external reversals—and the final cadence shift lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s emotional economy is rewired, cost felt in Mara’s extinguished glow. Causal lens holds: each shard placement tightens the lock until the final click re-opens the fountains. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—final shard—suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seed→fire→ruin cycles is taught by gear-clicks and past civilizations, tightening the emotional density until the final “listening” crystallizes the keeper’s eternal stance with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) established in first 60 words; no disorientation. Closure is a Charged Poise: options shrink to endless repetition, cost is the lifelong sorrow audible in the sonar echo. Persistent constraint—the gear’s brass teeth always return the same math—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unrolled ribbon exposes grief-as-network, reweighting every prior stone. The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres—butterfly arrivals thicken pattern, ribbon repetitions accrue—but the causality of Elena’s leap from isolated craft to communal design is compressed into a single summarizing paragraph; a dramatized beat of her first risky “echo-carving” would have sealed the change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the names migrate from solitary wood to communal brass, re-weighting the town’s calendar with unpaid ghosts. The pendulum’s impossible pause is taught early as a family secret, then paid off when Mara exploits it to charge the bob—causal logic holds. Orientation is immaculate: obsidian ridge, 4:13 arrival, retreating tide all appear inside 60 words. Cost is legible in the final image—“the tower’s steady heartbeat” now literally carries the drowned—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) sustains across lyric reiterations.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s resolve to plant the rose reweights every prior caretaker act into witness-bearing, and the cost (accepting lifelong stewardship of a stranger’s grief) is palpable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—stars, silo, tapestry threads accrue until the border cipher snaps the pattern—and the final image crystallizes options without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s maps crystallize three futures and the colony’s choice-space is reweighted with undeniable conceptual cost—“whether they would find it depended not on fate, but on their willingness to see beyond what they already knew.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of futures builds until the final image re-sets stakes. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (dwindling resources) shapes each modeled path.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the amber after-glow and brighter dust crystallize risk and reconfigure meaning (“stories persist”). Causal chain intact: because she copies, therefore the code spreads; because the patrol passes, therefore she accepts perpetual danger. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt—glow leaking through her fingers—yet the constraint (radio must stay hidden) shapes every tactic. Minor non-closure slip: “thistled calm” tag is tell-adjacent, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stopped rocker + Mira’s secret ash-hoard crystallize the gallery’s real rule—nothing vanishes, everything transforms—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: each portrait burn → ash → secret mask; Cassius’s dying request → Mira’s vow → immediate betrayal. Orientation anchor (“gallery’s center room”) appears by line 6; no debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of burn/rebuild tightens meaning until final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each descent tightens because/therefore linkage—archive → patrol threat → higher hiding. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: sealing the cylinder forecloses public vindication with felt cost (“abrasive calm” crystallizes the stance). Orientation anchored by word 80 (“storm drain…sunken district”). No telegraphing or lens drift. Persistent constraint—waterline and patrols—shapes tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure image—voices braiding under Mira’s watch—delivers a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural, not causal; stakes tighten only by repetition of rehearsals rather than a decisive beat that forecloses an option, keeping the cost conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single causal thread holds: seed-plant → moon-fed surge → prune → fruit. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the greenhouse reborn as “beginning” with visible cost (her warm shears, moons parting). Orientation is clear by line 4. The over-cranked metaphor chain (“synaptic roots,” “neural pathways,” “proto-roots”) slightly blurs the physical logic of how pruning alters memory-feed, keeping it below elite-band precision.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → drone failure → woman’s riddle → pollen solution; each step tightens Mira’s options. Orientation (who/where/when) is locked by line 4; tower, toll booth, amber dusk serve immediate action. Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira speaks truth that rewrites city protocol, feels the cost in her trembling climb and relinquished gate. Cost is on-page (“Her hands trembled…”) and persists—she cannot return to mute toll-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the house’s remembered grammar reweights Maya’s entire project, foreclosing passive documentation with quiet but unmistakable cost. Causal linkage is tight: each displaced object tightens the pattern until the orris-root fit detonates meaning. Orientation anchors by line 3; no latency.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: statue reveals secret → descendant returns → ampoule opened → lineage task rewritten. Orientation lands by line 8; no props teleport. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: descendant accepts guardianship, foreclosing easy blame; cost is the lifelong burden of telling an unpopular truth. Persistent constraint—the living statues’ eternal vigil—shapes the offer and her yes. One micro nit: “three days ago” is off-stage ellipsis, but it motivates present tension without breaking linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the proof that she herself is the conserved energy lands with crushing conceptual cost and is shown, not told. Causal chain holds throughout: because she keeps measuring, the staircase iterates; because she proves the loop, escape is mathematically impossible. Lens is Causal; every stair and dice roll is a therefore. No orientation debt; who/where taught by line 3 and paid off in the final image of her still-climbing silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early: each face is a glyph in a larger sentence of mercy. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canvas “speaks” without expositional summary and the decision to sleep/seek the giver lands with conceptual cost (she now owes the cycle). Orientation is crisp by line 3; the single transition (moon → dawn) is legible. No causal reversals are needed under this lens, but the final cost could be even sharper had the brush exacted a physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lock clicks on a museum that is also a lifeboat, bread dough rising in darkness. The lens alignment, though static, becomes the final image of “hope as art,” repricing the rules of survival. Causal chain: tour → recognition of shared loss → invitation → dough rising, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the beekeeper’s off-stage report is accepted without pushback, a mild coincidence that doesn’t obstruct but slightly thins the causal weave.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final snap rewinds the world’s gears with conceptual cost—“something fundamental clicked counter clockwise” reweights all prior rules. Causal lens holds throughout: because he finds the yoyo, therefore he dismantles, therefore he reassembles, therefore he initiates, therefore time recoils. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, low-tide rocks, night) are clear by word 50. Persistent constraint—reversed causality now governs his life—shapes the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s face becomes “everything fear could never contain,” reweighting the curse rule-set with undeniable cost (she can never be photographed again). Causal lens holds: because she speaks fear to the mirrors, therefore her image dissolves. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 60 (“abandoned carnival funhouse”) and never breaks. Advisor’s teleporting entrance is the one unmotivated beat, but it complicates rather than resolves, so keeps ≥8.8 eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: fractal cloud pattern → resonance mapping → orchard survival. Orientation lands by line 4; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard alive but Kael drained, salt-apple taste paying the cost. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; every strike of the mallet tightens options. The recursive rule-set is taught early and paid off in the final image of dawn clouds returned to “simple, peaceful shapes.”

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: whistle vibration → shell cracks → map revealed → expedition fate discovered → turtles halted. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the city is livestock and the shepherds are now staring back. The only slack is the off-stage welding of the gate; because the protagonist didn’t face that obstacle, the final beat’s price feels slightly second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: tip → discovery → recognition → exposure plan. Closure lands with visible forfeiture (“Her career … would end”), satisfying the cost test under a Causal lens. The single transition (station → drive) is legible; orientation anchors arrive at ~100 words. Escalation is linear rather than tightening; no second pressure pivot narrows options further.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lodged note crystallizes Garrett’s new vocation and forecloses ordinary surveyor detachment. Causal chain holds—each micro-choice (wade, measure, write, wedge) leads inevitably to the final sealing. Cost is legible in the warm brass against palm, synesthetic proof that he has traded professional neutrality for covert custodianship. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of submerged images and ink-warmth tightens until the cadence shift at dusk reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the camera and stamp reconfigure the moral equation—stillness is no longer silence but loaded resistance—felt cost is legible in the hush before security closes in. Causal chain from maritime letters → off-index archive → magnetic-lock failure → discovery is tight; blackout functions as motivated coincidence that complicates rather than rescues. Orientation is anchored within first 100 words (who = Marcus, where = sunken-library, when = blackout midnight). Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until the final crystallised stance. No loops or late rule changes; payoff image re-uses “reclaimed stillness” to re-weight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diamond crane’s ignition re-weights every prior lantern, making the daughter’s shadow live in communal light; cost is felt in Mira’s quiet pour, enduring while ascending. Causal chain holds—each polished gem records a dream, each crane accumulates until the thousandth crystallizes the inversion of private grief into shared garden—no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is clean; who/where/when anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the geode’s pulse + approaching coherence beneath make the cost of awakening legible without exposition. Causal chain (geode → detection → theory → smile) holds, but the middle “theory” beat is summary, not scene, so the tightening is intellectual, not visceral. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap applies: one off-page reversal (colleagues leave) is thin causality support.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s ascending signal reweights “missing pieces” into an active belonging network with on-page cost—Mara forfeits her spectator stance. Causal chain holds: chip → star-map → transmit choice. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single transition inside observatory; within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because Iris hired the lie, therefore Clara demands the truth, narrowing Maren’s options to confession. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s “I’m sorry” and Clara’s imperative “Tell me everything” reweight the premise with visible relational cost. One scaffold paraphrase (“she had been trying to account for the time…”) mildly dulls the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the drawer pull exists, Mara confronts incomplete truths; therefore she and Chen agree to swap classified histories next moon. Orientation anchored by line 3; one seamless scene; closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—the brass object literally passes hands, foreclosing the old negotiation frame while reweighting “neutral territory” as shared moral ground. Cost is visible: both diplomats risk treason by demanding truth.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to the crossing while clutching the broken compass—cost is visible, lens is causal. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single-scene default met. One minor causal leap: James’s text arrives exactly at dawn, a polite coincidence, but it complicates rather than solves. Accumulation of compass + utility-pole imagery tightens the final image without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lattice holds: erased memory → hollow conscience → baseball signal → decoded ads → cave descent → future-testimony stake, each beat narrowing options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she takes the paradox ball, foreclosing amnesiac safety; the price is the unknowable decades of re-learning empathy, legible in the final image of pulsing algae.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s luminous new form persists, cost paid in irreversible body-blur. Accumulative lens holds: each spice scent layers memory-density until the orchard reconfigures reality. Fortune-cookie seed pays off in final exchange, reweighting the rule-set. One micro-transition (orchard arrival) is legible; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mother-child card left behind and the saucer carried down re-weight the premise—lost time can’t be retrieved, only honored going forward—cost is unmistakable. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; density of starlight, ink, hand-prints accrues until the spiral pattern erupts in the shimmer of the gap between hands, re-tuning meaning. Orientation anchored by word 80; no causality breaks; set-ups (saucer crack, ink, cloth) all pay off in final image. Persistent constraint—fractured yet glowing saucer—literally lights her descent path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief photographs, pendant warmth, and buoyancy form a repeating texture that reweights at each return. Closure is a Charged Poise—Ren suspended between membranes, body translucent, cost legible as perpetual weightlessness. Orientation is anchored by word 35 (“Ren moved through its corridors”) and the pattern of tear-shimmers is taught early, so no penalty. The final image reconfigures meaning: the locked dimension opens not by force but by accumulated compassion, satisfying the RR test.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands: the jar’s opening is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes loss as generative under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is swift (“black sand beach exhaled heat…”), causality is quiet pattern-assembly rather than event-chain, and the cost—“letting go”—is visible in the freed lights that reweight prior coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: blackout (Kael) → Mira’s access → coded angles → 17 confirmations → Earned Stasis patrol that forecloses retreat. Orientation anchors inside 70 words; final patrol is the visible price (lost anonymity). Closure is clean, legible, and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pattern’s purpose flips from retrospective explanation to prospective pedagogy, with the visible cost of “borrowed dawn” becoming “earned.” Causal chain holds—dust → math → eel mirroring → insight—but the intermediate beat where she nearly loses the rocks to the tide is summarized, not shown, softening the because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when), so no penalty. Lens stays Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she lifts the next print, now armed with state-crime negatives, cost felt via trembling hands. Causal chain holds: censorship → vigil → envelope → new burden. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern (scar cartography) intensifies to single tightening. Only nit: off-stage documentary voice supplies stakes at the 11th hour, softening full causality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: Theodora’s offer of amnesty in exchange for public debate crystallizes options and reweights the sundial from cipher to civic platform. Cost is legible—“you know where to find me” couples invitation with exposed vulnerability. Causal chain holds: card → sundial → duel → offer, each because/therefore link tightening stakes. Lens stays situational-philosophical throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    A single accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the seed-and-rust imagery and held to the final line; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sign “Write What You Must” crystallizes the new communal rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) are fixed within 60 words and never slip. The false-bottom tin and mulched letters provide persistent constraints that shape tactics—Solomon can only choose rootedness once the secret compartment is emptied. No causality break; every beat is a because/therefore of planting or gifting.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock ticks → time unfrozen → Marcus chooses authentic visibility at the cost of perpetual invisibility. Causal chain holds: reel splice → compass flicker → arbor passage → creative awakening → homecoming. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Grand Central's lower concourse”).
