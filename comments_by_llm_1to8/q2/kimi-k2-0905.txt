  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing: Mara relinquishes her "frantic pulses of grief" and chooses to watch the storm arrive "minute by minute, scale by scale," forecloses the flight impulse with visible cost (acceptance of ongoing loss), and the final image ("drama is optional; change is not") reweights the premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated imagery (dust, scales, decay, storm) until the convergence ping and rain-shift crystallize the stance. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when the algorithm validates her "heresy," narrowing her emotional options and enabling the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (glass artist), where (canyon), and when (after studio fire) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: drifting resonance, frost patterns, and glass beads accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the hollow, where the protagonist stops, retraces her life, and turns back with a new purpose. However, the closure moment—"she understood the scorched testament was not a map forward but permission to step off the path"—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or action, and the cost (crushing the ledger, leaving the smuggler's route) feels conceptual but not viscerally legible on the page. The bus arrival and obsidian-as-payment land as convenient rather than causally prepared, softening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers thermal notation beats to reweight silence as expressive medium. Orientation anchors clearly (Mara, winterglass conservatory, post-Great Hush). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—silence redefined as thermal song—with conceptual cost legible in the scanner's death and Mara's departure. One weakness: the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; the fork-striking sequence accumulates density but the final image ("frost began to thaw in perfect fifths") lands as poetic declaration rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—undertaker becomes keeper, sends signals skyward—is present and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with a visible cost: he is tethered, occupies the desk, his parlor stands empty). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through underwater library imagery and the final column of stillness reweights the premise. However, causality between beats is loose (dream → travel → descent → lens repair) with ellipses that feel convenience-driven rather than motivated. The octopus catalog wrapping his ankle and his acceptance occur within a single paragraph without dramatized resistance, weakening the felt cost at closure. Mid-story beat linkage is outline-like ("he followed," "he located," "he understood"), and the lens shift from causal setup to lyric accumulation at the end is not taught early enough to feel seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pebbles collected, the ledger growing, the arbor spiral closing. The closure is Charged Poise—the silent bell vibrates, shutters open, the network holds—with conceptual cost legible in "until the sanctions cracked or the ridge itself remembered how to sing." Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (arbor, valley, midnight). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara decides to "triple the frequency" and places the final pebble. The cost is felt but oblique; the because/therefore linkage between the bell's silent ring and the shutters opening is compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: wisteria scent, camera obscura projections, and breathing rhythms layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors are present early (viaduct, camera, jade tear). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist steps through the door into the orchard and returns to distribute love, yet the cost remains largely atmospheric—"the fracture in her chest knit"—rather than a legible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. The meandering final paragraph ("slipping droplets… until the twilight viaduct… glowed softly") dilutes the pressure established by the orchard moment, and the accumulative pattern does not tighten into a single decisive image with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through spatial descent (turnings smelling of memories), the halo fragment flares to reveal true anatomy, and the final act of sealing the hourglass reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to loss. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts the garden's cycle with visible cost ("photographs once again fading," "dissolution now a comfort"). Orientation anchors early (designer, bridge garden, locket). One meaningful deepening occurs when she peels bark to see laminated moments, then tears a ring free, collapsing the maze and forcing her threshold choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes spatial anchors (carnival, redemption center, Tilt-A-Whirl) and traces a clear causal chain: decode keys → locate vault → retrieve seeds → scatter/flee. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: she plants seeds, fires the arrow as a banner, and walks away while "resilience will already be standing in green ranks." Cost is conceptual (regime will reclaim ground; she walks with chains still dragging) but legible. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative flourishes (recurring carnival imagery, musical cipher). Minor orientation delay—who she is and her exact goal clarify only after the opening beat—but the pattern pays off. One meaningful tightening occurs when guards are lured and tangled, narrowing her window before the wall falls.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory layering, forge encounter, and final garden reweighting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the obsidian shard and brother's laugh returning reweight absence into forgiveness, teaching trees to "hold both wound and blossom." Cost is legible—she admits her own doubt—but the price feels conceptual rather than immediately felt. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (drowned valley, greenhouse, Mara). One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses ear to forge and hears her complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece accumulates charged images (moonbeams, portraits, flower codes, the wedding ring) toward a double-exposure reunion. Closure—the husband's reconstituted face and the woman's acceptance—lands on the page with felt cost (the thief forfeits one portrait, the woman receives forgiveness). However, orientation debt is moderate: "emerald station" is named early but spatial choreography (bench, flower stall, tiles, tracks) remains vague until midpoint. The realization that the hooded woman had herself stolen the memory years ago provides a meaningful turn, but causality leans on coincidence (the thief happened to have stolen this woman's face weeks earlier without recognition). One persistent constraint—the jar's finite moonbeams—shapes the final tactic. Cost is legible but muted; the thief's satchel is "lighter by one portrait," a gesture rather than a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, recurring motifs (thaw, narration, bookmark), and a cadence shift at the end. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara leaves the dome behind, forecloses her original flight plan, and accepts that "safe zones...belong wherever they are needed, not wherever their maker flees"—a stance crystallization with visible cost (she walks away without her creation). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the dome on the console and renounces ownership, reweighting the dominant stake (craft safe zones vs. flee grief) with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in the image of her walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the piece follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (DNA test → hunt for shell → decrypt notes → find shell → outwit guards). Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: Leo commits to leaking the uncut reel, forecloses his old brand identity, and walks toward the final stunt with visible cost (he remains trembling but now owns it). The cost is legible in "heart still quaking but stride firmly adaptive" and the choice to weaponize his vulnerability. One slip: the convenience of the projector and perforated roof appearing exactly when needed borders on situational luck rather than protagonist-driven escalation, slightly undercutting the causal rigor at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the oracle's progressive mapping of silence accumulates density and symbolic weight toward a final Conceptual Repricing where she becomes "the first coordinate" herself. The cost is conceptual and spatial—the fort dissolves, she merges with her own work—and the final image reweights the premise without requiring causal linkage. One structural weakness: the midpoint meanders through similar descriptive beats (drawing symbols, noting echoes, adding to the map) without a clear tightening or deepening until the star winks out, flattening escalation slightly before the ending lands.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-taught repetition building toward the crystallized understanding at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening but the 23-minute loop mechanic is introduced early yet never tested—no on-page reversal shows what happens at minute 23. The closure unit achieves Conceptual Repricing: "thoughts came from the friction between what was and what could be" reweights the premise, but cost remains oblique—J4N-17 accepts repetition without visible forfeiture. The felt price of infinite looping is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira finds the lens, confirms no theft occurred, and releases both evidence and resentment with the open-lock doodle—a visible cost of choosing trust over vindication. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the eavesdrop narrows options and the projector screening reweights the forecourt emotionally. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first ~100 words. One moderate slip: the cryptic ticket's doodles are explained via overheard dialogue rather than discovered through Mira's agency, which slightly softens the causal spine at the inciting reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through accretive detail (marbles, garden's responses, the impossible apple) toward a final reconfiguration where Elara recognizes mutual servitude. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of who serves whom), with the cost legible in her acceptance of permanent partnership rather than mastery. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The 0.03% luck score and garden's response provide one meaningful tightening that reweights the stakes, though the pressure accumulates through pattern rather than causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps back, centers the lever, and commits to waiting, crystallizing the choice between intervention and patience with felt cost (she will not pull the lever tomorrow). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the nexus pulse, moth-bat interference patterns, holographic projections, and the vision of branching futures, culminating in a cadence shift at "she stepped back." Orientation anchors early (station, aviary, twilight routine). One meaningful deepening occurs when she steps "outside the station's timeline" and sees both futures, reweighting her nightly ritual into a repeatable proof rather than a theorem.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with motif layering (water damage, between-spaces, silence), but the closure lacks visible cost—the musician simply emerges and plays without a legible price or path foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines, avoiding penalty. Causality holds across beats (ghost appears → program guides → descent → revelation → playing), but the final image asserts thematic weight ("symphony of the unsung") without demonstrating how prior pressure tightens options or meaning. The structure follows a single POV across one continuous descent sequence, fitting scope defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (weather station, post-fever, mountain setting). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (botanical illustration, aurora, smudged leaves morphing into maps) that converge at the expulsion beat. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—the stone evacuated, the illustration blank except one torn leaf, "valley temporarily innocent"—and the final logbook entry crystallizes the price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when the oracle connects the smudged laurel to the mountain's topography, reweighting the swallowed truth as geographical/communal burden rather than personal burden alone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara returns the wheel, allowing the shift to stop, and her own swallowed truth shifts from lead to brass—a conceptual repricing with palpable cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (tunnel, valve wheel, tag, clanging) until the final cadence shift reweights the premise. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One structural seam: the ghost-shift premise hinges on the brother's backstory, yet that confession is narrated retrospectively rather than dramatized as a present choice, softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who: chronicle keeper; where: library in catacombs; when: "tonight" within "untold seasons") arrive within the first 120 words, meeting the baseline test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (obsidian, swan, feather, map, mirror-water, scales) and the final moment reweights the keeper's role through transformation. However, closure cost is asserted rather than made viscerally legible—"Her last sight was the overgrown library breathing" tells us transformation occurs but the felt price (loss of agency, identity dissolution) remains abstract. The "next chronicle keeper" coda gestures toward recurrence but does not deepen the cost paid on the page. Causality within the Accumulative lens is loose: the swan "unfolds one last time" and the book "closes over her hands" without clear because/therefore linkage or earned resistance that would make the transformation feel inevitable rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative lens is taught early through the braided structure of preparation-ritual-effect and holds through closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final image of children laughing at stretched shadows reweights the opening premise—wonder is "handed onward" rather than restored—with the conceptual cost that her work is "never finished." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. The descent functions as coda rather than a second decisive change, which fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors immediately (historian, silo library, post-human twilight). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: three diaries deepen the displaced-axis mystery, and pressure tightens through the historian's choices to probe, locate, and finally transfer the tapestry into the silo's concrete. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she becomes the axis she sought, the walls now hum with transferred dreams, and her solitude is visibly forfeited. Cost is legible in the final lines ("carrying nothing—because the story, at last, carried her"). One micro issue: the transition from abstract ("axis displaced") to physical mechanism (tapestry transfer) could be tighter, but the accumulative design holds and the closure reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening exchange and supply skiff arrival. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (lighthouse beam, open secret, stone keys) accrue density and the final departure reweights Chen's identity from spy to "wind." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Chen's untying of the skiff forecloses his espionage role with visible cost (abandoning specs, film, buyers). One meaningful deepening occurs when he plants the fortune-cookie film and chooses departure over remaining "one more note" in the island's enigma, but causality between beats occasionally feels elliptical rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered sound-manipulation, each loop adding pressure until the demon is trapped in paradox. Orientation anchors (priest, sanctuary, dimensional anchor, loop pedal) arrive early. The closure—priest becoming the axle, demon spinning forever—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he sacrifices mobility to contain the threat). Cost is legible: "his body slackened," he becomes a statue. The escalation reads as density increase and pattern break (loops overlap, form chords of contradiction, then slow and freeze), consistent with the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive by line 2 (fortune cookie writer, glass spire, dawn, frozen lake), so no penalty. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—five memories scored onto glass accumulate toward a symphony—but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the nautilus crumbles, the horizon folds, and a child will someday hear the music, yet no on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a path with felt price. The piece offers a Conceptual Repricing gesture (home = the map she drew), but the cost remains conceptual shimmer rather than undeniable pressure. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence in the final beat where a visible or felt price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and rune-pattern accumulate toward a final symbolic act. Orientation is delayed—who Kael is, where exactly he stands, and what timeline anchor exists remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit (smashing the tablet, stepping into nothing) attempts Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted through metaphor ("offering his weight in exchange for a name") rather than made undeniable on the page. The "elder Kael dissolved" sequence gestures at consequence but reads more as special-effect than felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (Mara, cavern, post-sister's-death). The closure—Mara feeling seasons turn again, grief arriving fully—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she welcomes pain as drumroll, ending numbness. The needle's backward spin and the drum's forward beat bracket the transformation. One meaningful deepening: the lullaby peels layers, the drum delivers present pulse. Cost is legible in "grief arrived fully" and her choice to teach through skin-listening.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Elara, courtyard, dusk, three-year routine). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: causal pressure (follower forces lateral move) escalates into accumulative/textural closure where the underground log and released scrolls reconfigure the quarantine from disease-containment to truth-suppression. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elara forgoes surface life until "screens overflow," an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid that forecloses normal return. One tightening (vellum discovery → descent → counter-log) is sufficient for this length; the cost of solitude is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, meditative pattern through rope imagery and the texture-of-time motif. Orientation anchors (terra-cotta grotto, three days post-arrival, roadside poet) land early. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator walks into starlight "still flesh, still poetry, still discovering," rope coiled at waist, choosing "the weight of choice itself"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (foregoing transcendence, accepting Earth's decay). However, the cost remains more asserted than dramatized in a single image; the closing passage tells us the choice is "impossible and perfect and mine" rather than letting the image alone carry that weight. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator discovers Marcus's hiding place and decides to write patterns rather than poems, reweighting the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered acoustic imagery, the seed's root breaking through the bowl, and the wire-bridge improvisation; the final seedling leaf constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the bowl's humming and the green leaf reweight the mendicant tradition with conceptual cost—no bonfire, no crowd. Causality holds under this lens: each unfinished note accumulates pressure until the greenhouse "kept breathing unfinished music." Cost is legible in Mara's departure and the bowl left behind. One micro turn (shipwreck bell answering) supports without fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira's choice to remain, breathing in residue and letting it hurt, forecloses her prior armor with palpable cost ("cracked vial" she doesn't check). The accumulative/textural lens holds—sensory density builds through static, scent layers, and the grotto's transformation until the final grounding gesture. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when the petal releases clients' emotions, reweighting her stake from selling to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens: the mistaken envelope initiates a discovery chain, and the closure reconfigures the meaning of Marisol's cyclical kindness through the locket exchange and ledger notation. Cost is present but muted—Marisol loans the photo "until the next cycle demands it," a gesture more poetic than a visible foreclosure of options. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (who, where, when anchored by the second paragraph). One meaningful deepening occurs when the envelope's contents reveal Dalia Cruz's legacy, reweighting Marisol's private acts within a larger network of care, but the final image leans heavily on metaphor ("value immeasurable") rather than a dramatized price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear spatial anchoring (crater, orchard, arbor) by the opening. The closure—Lira's exhaled glyph and her decision to place more herons—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her shift from observer to participant with felt cost (the "buckled knees" moment, the relinquishment of solitary identity). One meaningful tightening occurs when her fingertip meets the quicksilver tag and triggers the lattice vision, narrowing her stance from searcher to signpost. The cost is somewhat diffuse but legible in the final image of her "becoming both seeker and signpost."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. The piece teaches its pattern early (reversed water, yawning gargoyles, clock striking backward) and accumulates pressure through increasingly charged images. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira completes the interrupted cadence and returns transformed, now able to illustrate "the doorway" rather than "what was lost." The cost is legible—she surrenders "unspent future" in tiny boats of digits—and the final image reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length; the piece holds its lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (crystal fruit, primes, fog-braiding vectors) and the closure—astrolabe projection triggering seedlings, stone sealing—reweights the orchard from death to dormancy with visible cost (no body, no farewell, only approached limit). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing; the tightening moment (glass eyes align, mosaic opens) deepens understanding without a decisive external change. Cost is conceptual and felt but diffuse; the final image of resumed dripping and the protagonist stepping into the desert lands cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments are cached, then uncovered in a layered release that builds density and reweights the stake of becoming visible. Orientation anchors early (crawl space dweller, library, dawn, outage). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the girl's whispered "I see you" and their joint reading crystallize the options—Elias moves from isolation to witnessed presence—with felt cost (three years of solitary labor now shared, the ending of his hidden autonomy). The cost is emotional and relational, legible in "would not cache alone anymore." One minor gap: the mechanics of how tape fragments "float up" and are heard without playback equipment is elided, creating a light logic strain that does not break the closure but slightly softens causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal–accumulative hybrid lens: Mira's scientific control meets an uncontrollable phenomenon, pressure tightens through the storm and physical transformation, and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her metamorphosis becomes a map of "reluctant metamorphosis" with visible cost (loss of human agency, rooted into the floor). Orientation is clean (greenhouse, storm, Mira's fifteen-year history by paragraph three). The accumulative intensification through silver veins → pain → splitting skin → rooting is legible, though the final "released her grip" moment leans tell-heavy where a final concrete choice would sharpen the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors late (~"The island's monastery" at line 5) but the disorientation does not serve closure, triggering a modest penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara follows rain trails, exchanges fragments, paints, receives water, and returns transformed—a density increase that reweights her insomnia without a causal because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (insomnia reframed as vigilance, enabling sleep), but the cost is conceptual and muted; the vial of pure water and the completed painting are received gifts rather than sacrifices. The middle exchange with the old woman functions as recognition and thematic echo more than a tightening that narrows options, limiting escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (pilgrim), where (musical crystal cave), and when (upon arrival) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (cave pearl, luminous scar, overlapping shadows) and a cadence shift at closure when he sits in the park years later, reweighting the premise with the felt cost of the clairvoyant's permanent entrapment. The transfer of clairvoyance and the scar function as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into Earned Stasis), crystallizing his role as carrier and her sacrifice. Minor causality gaps—how he exits when the entrance vanishes, why the cave "seals the transaction"—remain opaque but do not collapse the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (harbor, exile ship, archivist role). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator gathers trumpet fragments across locations, and the final note reweights prior silence into resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the single tone "folded into every doorway like a page finally turned" reconfigures the harbor's silence with undeniable acoustic and symbolic pressure. Cost is conceptual (the archivist trades an empty satchel's promise for the mouthpiece and commits the echo to a new archive), legible but not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman asks what the archivist can give in return, tightening the stakes from fragment-hunt to exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (rail yard, 3:07 a.m., Alden's role). The piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—punch, arrows, starlit vault—that reweight at closure when the fortress becomes stacked journals and the punch dissolves into paint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Alden draws "the first honest line," reweighting his obsessive mapping into arrival rather than escape. Cost is conceptual and felt (years of silence, canvases turned to wall) but the final image could make the price more visceral. One meaningful deepening present; causality is metaphoric but coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (whale song, starlight, memories surging) and holds it through a pattern of intensifying sensory and emotional layering that culminates in the transcription becoming a musical score. Orientation anchors (tower, Mara, autumn migration, the tile) land cleanly within the first ~15% of the text. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara releases the tile into the tide pool, relinquishing proof but affirming connection—with visible cost (she cannot publish, yet trusts). One weakness: the causal link between the tile lifting at midnight and Mara's decision to write musical notation rather than digits is compressed, relying on accumulation rather than a clear motivational pivot on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening beat (who: Vey; where: prismatic escondite; when: during solar storm). The causal chain—fragment compels Vey → he finds technicians → amulet completes → door appears → Vey steps through—holds under a Causal lens. Closure lands on-page: Vey proceeds into darkness, choosing to relinquish memory, a Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of infinite time, unknown afterward). One persistent constraint (amulet's magnetic compulsion) shapes tactics throughout, and the cost is legible in "time peel away" and the woman's "restless pilgrimage."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal with tight because/therefore linkage: Cassidy waits → Rurik arrives → ink compels rewrite → document completed → pot cracks → asylum grant mailed. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the lullaby memory vanishes, the ink solidifies, and the document is mailed in blood—landing cleanly on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rurik begins to write under the ink's influence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the escalating density of invented pasts, the bonsai transformations, and the final ash-fertilization build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aurelia's forgeries become real and the silence is "seeded." Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost—her notepad is lighter by one forgery, heart heavier by one truth—and the final image of blank sheets as seeds reweights the premise. The orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the because/therefore linkage holds under the accumulative mode. One meaningful deepening occurs when the trees rearrange and speak in textures, tightening the stakes around her inventions becoming real. The Cost proof test is satisfied: "notepad lighter by one forgery, heart heavier by one truth" makes the trade-off legible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (Mara, port containers, tidal rhythm) established early. Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara moves from erased to active archivist, feeding her death certificate to the tide and stamping a memorial, with the conceptual cost of remaining "officially no one" made legible in the final paragraph. The escalation proceeds through layered discoveries (archive, dying captain, micro-recorder) that deepen rather than reverse, fitting the chosen lens, though the captain's exposition and the poison's mechanics introduce mild causality softness that doesn't break the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established early (myth buster, abandoned observatory, painted seashell). The piece accumulates pressure through three notes that summon voices, and the final passage offers a Conceptual Repricing: "the riddle was not why the sounds were identical, but why listeners insisted on difference." However, the cost is stated rather than dramatized—Arlen pockets the compass and walks on, and the final image ("echo with the three sounds") feels more like a thematic tag than a moment where options narrow or a price is paid. The closure reconfigures meaning but lacks visible consequence that alters what comes next.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through the Syndicate threat, midnight assembly, and overnight reorganization, crystallizing in Charged Poise at closure ("we are still becoming"). Orientation anchors quickly (perpetual carnival, Lina's role, Syndicate threat). The escalation from individual graffiti signal to collective reorganization to inspectors' retreat is causally clean, and the ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the carnival rehearses "change as another act, not the closing curtain" with felt cost (privatization merely postponed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the assembly decides to reorganize overnight, narrowing options with visible tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final shutter fires at the last possible second, the anemones fold into fossil, and the grain flushes crimson—options crystallize with undeniable cost (her timer confirms "no margin"). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the chemical timer, the anemones' bloom cycle, and the metaphor of witnessing as resistance, culminating in a cadence shift when the blossoms seal "like letters never meant to be mailed." Orientation anchors early (moonlit summit, Mount Selene, crater inspector), and the causal spine—steal grain, prepare reaction, photograph, shutter—holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). Drive lens reads Causal: boiler explosion backstory → blind repair method → fracture diagnosis → silica patch → feedback terror → water-barrel recalibration → launch. The closure is a Decisive Change (drone lifts and departs) with visible cost (Lira releases it into uncertainty, village depends on arrival). One meaningful tightening: the seven-minute countdown narrows options and forces the water-barrel innovation. Micro turn (jitter after initial patch) sets up the final solution without fragmenting pressure. Cost is present but could be sharper—success feels assured once she identifies the feedback problem, slightly dampening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren returns, brews coffee, begins a new map "Origin: classified," knowing the Registry will dismiss it—visible defiance with career cost, and the final image ("she listened for rivers learning to speak") reweights her stance from dutiful cataloger to witness-keeper. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered river words, glowing microorganisms, the spiral motif, culminating in thepage-dissolving image and her refusal to transmit coordinates. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes convergence as a moment, not a place, which narrows her choice to witness or report. Orientation is anchored early (outpost, frozen lake, Maren alone). Cost is legible: she defies the Registry, loses proof, and accepts mythologization.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elian traces circuits, the fork drinks rhythm, dust becomes figures, and the town rebuilds via layered pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure lands on-page—Elian becomes the tenth bell, transparent, suspended—constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with visible cost (his physical dissolution). However, the causal chain from footsteps → fork resonance → full town reconstruction → his transparency feels compressed and asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, weakening the felt inevitability of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (the hush tightening, air pocket shrinking, organ mechanism discovered) and culminates in a meaningful tightening when the lilac signal breaks the temple's resistance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rescue arrives, but Mira stays to record, and the temple adopts her past as liturgy—options are reweighted with felt cost (the empty vial as offering, her certainty that "some places are forgotten only until someone chooses to remember them out loud"). One persistent concern: the temple's shift from muffling to amplifying reads slightly convenient; the organ mechanism provides scaffold but the causality feels compressed in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit—Cassian walking into copper morning carrying the hush—lacks visible cost or a legible before/after change in options. Orientation is delayed and fragmentary: who Cassian is, why he's arrived now, and what "before they find the bodies" means remain opaque past the 120-word mark without payoff at closure. The Drive Lens is ambiguous between Accumulative/Textural and Causal; metaphorical density suggests the former, but the lattice-fitting and staircase descent gesture toward causal turns that never tighten options. The keepers' vanishing, the father's imprisonment, and the wolf's reality are all withheld without dramatized friction that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—forgiveness and transformation through fruit harvest—lands on the page with a visible image (the bride gains feet, the bead cracks). However, the drive lens wavers between Causal (debt repayment logic) and Accumulative (seven-night ritual), and the mechanics of how the fruit "distills sorrow" into payment are asserted rather than dramatized. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when clarified only after greenhouse description), triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The boy's agency in the final beat is muted; he follows guidance rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accretes images (kelp threads, petroglyphs, loom, orchids) and the final bridge/tide return reweights the opening emptiness. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words, though "when" remains vague ("every night since the harbor dried"). The closure—tide returning, loom sinking, bridge glowing—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse; no clear path is foreclosed, and Calyx "returned to the silent wharf... ready for the next night" suggests cyclical recurrence rather than a decisive alteration. The closing image recharges prior motifs (orchids, loom, footprints) yet the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraphs, creating mild drift before anchoring (~−0.3). The piece reads under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through discovered objects (mirrors, reliquary, root-road) and ritual acts that reweight the stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she never leaves, the faith is rebuilt, the island becomes her endpoint—but the cost is conceptual (exile from broader diaspora life) rather than viscerally dramatized on the page. The final image recharges the sundial motif, yet the before/after legibility depends on summary ("never left") rather than a decisive on-page choice or forfeiture in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered imagery (chalk spiral, letters, pseudonyms) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she mails the unsigned letter and erases the chalk codes—choosing to remain unread rather than falsely known. The cost is conceptual (foreclosing authentic connection) and legible in the final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the second paragraph. The closure lands, but the tightening is gradual rather than sharply felt; the piece deepens more than it escalates, which fits the accumulative design but leaves the ending quieter than the high-band gate prefers.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: the embroiderer gathers intelligence, creates the hidden-layer map, and reveals it at a timed moment to avert the coup. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences. However, closure cost is largely conceptual—the conspirators "left the chamber changed"—without a visible forfeiture or decisive on-page alteration by the protagonist that narrows her own options. The coup is averted off-page ("dawn arrived without speeches"), and the final image returns her to routine stitching, suggesting Earned Stasis, but the cost that forecloses a path is not made legible in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—imagery and metaphor accumulate toward a reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist speaks the apology, letters transform to moths, path home appears), but cost remains largely metaphorical rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or choice with visible consequence. Orientation anchors (mangrove labyrinth, protagonist + medium) arrive early. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; the pattern is taught and sustained. However, the accumulative pressure does not tighten meaningfully—beats feel like variations on a theme rather than escalation that narrows options or raises stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, reflective mode early; pressure accumulates through layered confession and the unknotting ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ache shifts from shrapnel to sediment, coral lightens) with felt cost visible in the shared weight and the narrator's return to the buffer zone carrying dew instead of blood. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no debt penalty. One micro turn (the realization that notes are confession, not inventory) deepens stakes without breaking accumulative coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the fresco fragment triggers layered memory-work, the Lantern Lattice sequences the reveal, and the final mural installation delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the joy "merely waited to be developed"). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the fog-orchard frame by the second paragraph. Cost is present but conceptual: each brushstroke trades "present sorrow" for past laughter, and the pocket empties while the heart "over-exposes." The cadence shift from search to display reweights the dominant stake with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—lyric density and pattern recurrence dominate. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: the guide's reply ("The picture dreams you...") reframes the opening question and the nickel/nested structure. However, cost remains abstract—Liora "steps onto fresh grass" and lifts her spoon with no legible forfeiture, no prior path closed. The "certainty for curiosity" barter is declared but never enacted as a trade-off that narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a situational/accumulative hybrid: Arlo plants one seed, evades Voss, escapes to continue his mission. Closure reads as Charged Poise—seven gardens will spell "Resist" by dawn, and citizens will "feel an untaxed thought unfurl"—but the cost remains abstract and future-facing rather than paid on the page. The warp mechanism and secret-language choreography are present but not causally tight; the pollen-cloud escape and sideways slip feel convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, recursive pattern early (spiral imagery, half-sung lullabies, postcard motif) and accumulates pressure through density and cadence until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (Zale, nautilus cathedral, dusk) arrive promptly. However, closure relies on atmospheric assertion—"photosynthesizing inside the shell," "dreaming forward the wars"—rather than a legible on-page act or realization that reconfigures options with felt cost. The postcard's transformation (peeling apart, blossoms glow, sealing into the apex) gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but the conceptual price remains diffuse and the causal stakes ("wars that would end before they began") feel more thematic claim than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through lyric patterning and density increase, holding it through the chandelier sequence to a Conceptual Repricing at closure where Lira becomes the "final extinct feeling." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. However, the cost—though conceptually present—remains abstract: we see memories listed but never feel their loss reshape her stance or tactics in subsequent beats. The causal chain (cracked tube → light → payment → preservation) functions but the escalation is additive rather than transformative until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a causal lens: Elara translates, the archive resists, she offers restitution, the symphonies complete. Orientation is present by line ~60 (who, where, when). The closure—leaving the ink well glowing as a future promise—reads as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (her absence becomes the final note), but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. One persistent constraint (the archive's possessiveness) shapes tactics in the middle, lifting execution. The "by sunrise" coda tells outcomes rather than showing a decisive on-page reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is established early (amphitheater, volcano, floodgate dispute). The causal chain—adhesive analysis → coordinates → hidden tube → lullaby → acoustic mediation → compromise—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when the lullaby transforms the delegations' perception. Closure lands on the page with the water surging and Mireya feeling the founder's ongoing decision. The cost, however, remains somewhat abstract: "hands did not tremble" and "familiar weight" are felt states, but we don't see a concrete path foreclosed or a visible price paid in the final image. The ending drifts slightly into thematic summary ("trust ingenuity more than victory") rather than resting on the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote balance, archival sorting, and the lullaby fragments pattern toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. However, the closure unit—Mirela's escape and the song's dispersal—occurs largely off-page ("She was already gone"), summarized rather than dramatized, which weakens the felt cost at the moment of departure. The conceptual repricing (songs survive when set free) lands in reflection rather than image, and the children humming years later functions as epilogue rather than on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines (Juniper on the drifting terrace after the butterfly effect). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images (logbook, grain, maze coordinates) toward a final resonant reconfiguration where Juniper "walked the invisible corridors" and heard her father's lesson. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"some distances are necessary because they teach us to read the weather in wood"—with the terrace carrying her forward. Cost is felt but oblique: she does not regain her father, yet the maze "dissolved," leaving only forward drift. One meaningful deepening occurs when she steps off the terrace "into air that felt thick with memory." Minor causality slips (how does analyzing grain yield exact coordinates? how does stepping off produce the maze?) slightly weaken the middle linkage but do not break the accumulative pattern or final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens early (constellation charting, ritual completion) and the final image attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the paper-bird gesture. However, orientation debt is moderate: "three hours before midnight" and the facility layout are anchored late, and the stakes—will she surface or stay?—are declared rather than dramatized through constrained choice. The closure image (paper bird, burning feather) reweights prior material but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we do not see what she forfeits by returning. The drive lens holds but the closure unit lacks the sharp before/after edge required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (Lira, geode, recollectionist quest) land early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and image recurrence (seeds → flowers → ash → mosaic → ribbon path) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira creates a new path and vows to prevent future loneliness. Cost is felt (the cliff's abandonment, her own promise), and the closing image reweights the opening stake. However, the causal chain is soft—"perhaps the path had not eroded but retracted" is conjecture, and the final resolution (mosaic turning, ribbon forming) leans on convenient mechanism rather than protagonist struggle. The closure lands but with muted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Situational hybrid lens: Cipher's micro-interventions (cup, bishop, ferret-path timing) accumulate into a cascading social event, and the closure—pulling the slot machine and walking away before reels stop—reweights his orchestration with conceptual cost (he releases control, satisfied that randomness now belongs to the stars). Orientation is clear by ~80 words (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he walks away from outcome), but the cost is oblique—satisfaction without visible sacrifice—keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and establishes Lysira's goal: to inscribe a forbidden verse on her skin. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and the intensification of her dance ritual. Closure arrives when the verse completes and she becomes "the forbidden memory," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise). The cost is legible: she embodies contraband that censors cannot erase. One tightening occurs when the moonstone dust dims and burns to complete the final line, foreclosing return but anchoring her new state. The method coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara enacts a ritual, memory-images accrue meaning through the prism's projection, and the final throw releases color into the town. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mara's ledger is "balanced" and she smiles, with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. The prism dissolves into windows it heals, but this is a convenient resolution rather than a renunciation or endurance with on-page sacrifice. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat specifies what Mara has lost or given up to achieve this communion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual gestures (opening box, tasting ash, drawing spiral) that deepen the stake of speaking versus silence, and the closure—leaving the box open, descending lighter, committing to the survivors' group—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to commitment) with felt cost (innocence bargained is never returned). Orientation anchors (Elias, moonlit ridge, three years post-fire) arrive cleanly within the first third. One friction: the celestial bodies and "bargain" motif remain somewhat abstract and the causal linkage between tasting ash and the decision to speak relies more on lyric accumulation than because/therefore steps, which is acceptable under this lens but prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Mira in a grotto), satisfying orientation. However, causality is vague: the altitude gauge "resets itself to zero altitude, zero despair" without prior mechanism, and a balloon "descends from the cavern roof—impossible, since no opening existed" in a gesture that borders on convenience magic. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the grotto dims, Mira walks into the tide with footprints polished smooth), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of image and pattern), yet the closure does not decisively reweight prior material; it restates the premise in a quieter register.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and maintains a clear accumulative lens throughout, building density through the ivy-passage → diaries → negatives → tunnel sequence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira becomes the echo she was hired to trace, a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (her disappearance, the rescue team finding only a negative). The causal chain is motivated by discovery rather than decision, which fits the accumulative mode, and the final image reweights all prior material—the building-as-camera premise pays off with undeniable conceptual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~120 words, waive penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric accretion toward a final image). Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (the heartbeat gifted, mirrors begin to respond, children sing the lullaby). Cost is asserted ("keep the pulse and paint alone forever") but not dramatized—no on-page struggle or visible forfeiture that charges the final image. The piece teaches a symbolic pattern early but the closure feels declarative rather than earned through prior causality or accumulation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Pressure accumulates through ritual layering (offerings, name-speaking, collective cairn-building) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard transforms from negotiation tool to cradle, shatters into distributed light, and Kaelen's burden becomes "shared strength"—a Charged Poise moment where the war is "transformed into something that could be carried, not conquered." Cost is conceptual and relational (the terrace crumbles, his role shifts), though the felt price at the peak beat could be sharper. One meaningful deepening through collective witness is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a tightening deepening in the swallowing beat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he carries the echo internally, the map dissolves, and his voice will carry an "absence beating." The cost is legible—he remains caged by his own amorality—and the lens holds without contradiction. One persistent constraint (the map and drought choreography) shapes both tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear by the opening line; causality flows through his manufactured drought to this engineered night to the ingestion moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through recurring images (snow/thaw, echoes, prism facets) toward a final reconfiguration where the city wakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lys sings to wake rather than lull, statues fill with light, dawn arrives "raw" rather than compliant. Orientation anchors arrive late—"silver courtyard," "prism sanctuary," Lys's role are named but spatial choreography inside the sanctuary remains vague until the plinth beat. The escalation from arrival to core-opening to collective awakening is legible under the Accumulative lens, but the cost (contract burns away, yet "alarming serenity remained") feels asserted rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (calligrapher, dome, post-argument). A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted—Lucien moves from aesthetic refusal to a new ethical stance—but the reversal ritual (burning the stick while speaking backward) functions as convenient magic rather than causal pressure that narrows options. The closure manifesto is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a live path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (images and motifs reweight meaning), and the final image of words written in ash does recharge prior material, but the cost remains abstract rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear: Elara, dawn, grotto above clouds. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of image and metaphor builds toward a final release. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the memorial lifts, the butterfly's flight becomes whole), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible as a forfeited path or altered option. The "empty space in her pocket" gesture nods toward loss, yet the piece never dramatizes what Elara sacrificed or what specific choice this act forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (icebound sanctum, aurora, protagonist alone). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rope-braiding ritual transforms the punched card's pattern into voiced memory, then the protagonist carries those names forward in speech and water. Cost is visible: "heavier by the cargo of voices," the card dissolves, and the protagonist must now repeat the names so rivers learn them. One meaningful deepening occurs when the rope lifts and voices unfold; the accumulative density (wax casting → bell → organ → rope → wind → water) reweights the stake of preservation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: images and metaphors accrue toward a final conceptual repricing ("walkers and paths are one another's becoming"). Orientation is established early (bunker, storm approaching, dream chamber). The closure—her dissolution and the forest's transformation—lands as Conceptual Repricing with the directive rewritten, but the cost remains largely metaphorical rather than viscerally felt on the page. The dream-bird sequence and vine-ladder ascent function as pattern rather than causal pressure, which is valid under the chosen lens, though the final reweighting lacks the undeniable charge of a stronger RR or CR.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line; the two-shard structure (scriptorium → inner sanctum) is legible with a clean spatial transition. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the drawing ritual, the lattice projection, the door opening, and the covenant oath, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Naram-bel becomes "the silence between regimes." Cost is felt but oblique—he vanishes, forecloses teaching, guards the chamber—yet the final image of "dust that refused to settle" and footfalls heard "ever after" reweights the opening premise. One persistent issue: the magic square's mechanics (how it projects, unlocks, returns prophecy) are told rather than causally dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the sanctuary's shifting properties and cellular-memory motif, holding it through closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words. The shadow-Lira reversal deepens pressure and the final act—accepting her own resentment—reconfigures the stake with visible cost (she metabolizes her anger, disperse the shadow, leaves the broken box behind). One meaningful tightening is present and the closure lands on the page with felt cost under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream is reintegrated, the orchard transforms, and the mirror maker's relationship to boundaries shifts from erasure to breathing them into new forms. The causal chain is legible—blood repairs the sextant, sextant tethers the dream, dream roots in the sapling—but the mechanics lean heavily on metaphor rather than choices under pressure. Cost is present (the bleeding palm, centuries of fog lifting) but feels more world-consequence than personal foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the breach sets a wound, the bag ritual and graft work accumulate density, and the week-long bloom plus daughter's return reconfigure meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ribbon rotting into bark, fragrance as covenant), and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (the mender's vows composting into roots). Orientation is clear early (cathedral, mender, breach). However, the escalation is largely iterative—grafting, waiting, daughter's question—without a single decisive pressure point that narrows options under stress, and the cost remains more metaphorical than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—accumulative/textural motifs compete with causal-seeming events (envelope in stomach, mirror corridor) that don't link because/therefore. The closure unit ("The curator is the catalog") reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted thematically ("forfeit her sanity page by page," "every galaxy-fruit she plucked, a page vanished") rather than made undeniable in a final image. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative pattern but the ending blurs into meta-commentary ("Knowledge is not forbidden; it is inherited backwards") rather than landing a charged final perception. No clear tightening narrows options under pressure; visions arrive rather than being pursued with escalating trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Elara is, where she begins, and what she seeks remain abstract until well past the opening third. The drive lens is ambiguous throughout—moments read causal (time traveler rescue), accumulative (seed metaphors), and situational (library cipher), but none coheres at closure. The ending offers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; Elara "releases absences" and steps "into the next sentence" without foreclosing a path or paying a legible cost. The cipher resolution (hybrid bud exhales a word; Elara loses one year) is narrated in summary without dramatized stakes or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece operates in accumulative/textural mode but struggles to teach its pattern or demonstrate cost. Orientation is delayed well past 120 words (who is "chimera twin discoverer"? what does "fused to her spine" mean physically?) without payoff that charges closure, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The ending offers an image (emerald lily drifting north) but no legible before/after: the protagonist's options, knowledge, or stance show no decisive alteration. The sinking ship reads as atmospheric backdrop rather than consequence of prior choices. Causality is diffuse: events happen in thematic proximity rather than because/therefore linkage, and the closure unit lacks visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (clock, rope, seal, village), building to a Conceptual Repricing where the village is "tucked into the space between ticks." Orientation anchors (Elara, tower, 3:17 a.m.) land early. Closure reconfigures the premise: absence is translated into circulating presence, and the clock resumes with the village now folded into time's fabric. Cost is conceptual but legible—the void is given form, history is reweighted. One pressure point: the frozen clock that "stopped only when the world forgot something it could not bear to remember." The escalation, however, is entirely external and atmospheric; Elara's actions face no resistance, and no choice forecloses a path or alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers density through recurring images (echo chamber stone, bloom of hush, crack patterns) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mapkeeper releases the stored voices in the dome, creating a sigh "that carried no sound, only meaning." The cost is legible—she leaves the caves carrying "nothing but the hush"—and the final image reweights the opening's survival-through-silence into an act of preservation. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the beings' stolen voices flicker, confused by the carved silence, forcing the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic pattern early (pavilion → desert → pavilion), transitions are legible, and closure lands with a conceptual repricing: the custodian becomes the living prism, reweighting coincidence as refracted intention. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present within the first paragraph. The quest structure accumulates symbolic weight through the shard recovery, and the ending image (rose light, voices folding backward) reconfigures prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt—she takes on the tower's burden—but the stakes never narrow options in a way that forecloses a visible alternative path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist gathers sensory and mnemonic fragments, and the final sequence—arranging fog pellets, sculpting a figure, descending—reweights her stance from archivist-as-ledger to mosaic-participant. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (hybrid of Earned Stasis and Charged Poise): she renounces singular identity and commits to fragmentary becoming, leaving the translucent figure as seed. Cost is conceptual and legible in the final image: she walks away "pockets empty, mind uncluttered," foreclosing archival purity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tiles whisper "Fragment is also form," shifting her stance and enabling the sculpting act that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (Luma, fortress, dusk) and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and pattern-density build toward a final reweighting. The closure lands—starlight returns, black sand floats—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on Luma's body or choices; the governor's hourglass and the sentries' smiles are effects witnessed, not prices paid. The kerosene rag → rocket → cracked sky sequence holds causal linkage in its mechanics, yet Luma's agency is undermined by the convenience of the silver dust passage and the governor's unexplained consent, which together function as plot lubrication rather than earned turns.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—tangential observation accumulating toward relational repair—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when both stand in the transition-period dawn. Causality is clean: the chronicler's flight to the grotto, the daughter's drawn arrival, the jade cicada exchange, and the resumed conversation form a coherent sequence. Cost is felt but oblique—the discomfort of the pause, the "half sob" laugh—yet the final image reweights the opening fracture with undeniable emotional pressure, satisfying the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lira climbs, encounters silences, collects them, then releases them in a pattern-break that reweights her relationship to confinement. Orientation anchors quickly (inverted gravity, xenial trellis, claustrophobic child). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she returns to the bunker transformed, "the walls, now intangibly tangible, could no longer contain her," with visible cost (the empty doll left behind, the lost collection). The reversal—releasing rather than hoarding—pays off prior accumulation. Minor causal softness: the keeper's trade and membrane passage feel more symbolic than mechanically constrained, but the lens holds and cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (prisms, crystals, the storm glass cycle) and a pattern of silences teaching comfort. Orientation anchors quickly (drifting terrace, Nilo, storm glass, gondola). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Nilo opens the gate "for no one," awaits the next passenger, and the storm glass is "perfectly clear, ready to catalyze whatever noise or stillness the morning would dare to bring"—crystallizing his vocation with visible cost (solitude, perpetual waiting). One meaningful deepening occurs when the commuter's spoken fear catalyzes new crystals, reweighting the premise. The lens holds; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors are delayed and obscured by dense descriptive layering in the opening third (−0.4). The story is a walking tour rather than a causal chain—each beat is and-then sequencing (touches wall, sees waterfall, pulls torch, peels paint, opens door, climbs stairs, sits on throne) with no because/therefore linkage. The throne-sitting resolves nothing the protagonist struggled against on the page; she arrives, the crown assembles itself, and she accepts a role that was never in doubt. No Decisive Change, no Earned Stasis with visible cost, no Conceptual Repricing—only a thesis statement in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow keeper learns to breathe through suffocation). Orientation is clear early. The closure image—"tomorrow she would practice suffocating again"—does reweight the opening practice, but the cost remains oblique: we don't see what path she has foreclosed or what tactical shift this gift imposes. The ritual structure flattens causality; the boy's dissolution feels inevitable rather than contingent on her choices, weakening the closure's felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the hum, glitch-texts, and mushroom cave sequence toward the diamond formation and ocean toss. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the diamond pitch reweights debt and the ocean's calm signals multiversal contract release—with conceptual cost (blood, forfeiture of the diamond). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira slots the bolt and "squeeze harder" collapses installments into the diamond. The parallel-Lira chorus complicates but does not resolve, consistent with situational overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of layered metaphor and sensory density early, holds it through the confession playback, and lands closure when Arin speaks the truth aloud and walks toward the river—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize with felt cost (name "burned clean," blood treaty signed). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the confession plays and Arin bleeds onto the map, reweighting the personal stake into public witness. Cost is legible in the final third (blood, name loss, dynasty dismantled), satisfying the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors appear within the opening paragraph (knight, greenhouse, reality-shift moment). The closure—transformation into marionette guardian—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with visible cost: human form traded for wooden imprisonment. The escalation accumulates through choreographed movements and the puppet's offer, culminating in the irreversible exchange. One meaningful deepening occurs when the knight realizes "the shape of possibility was never a single thing to capture but a continuous folding." Cost is legible in the final image of eternal vigil, though the causal linkage between unsnapping the clasp and the transformation could be sharper—it reads more as ritual completion than motivated choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns → photograph → note → envelope → whispered name builds density and reweights "small kindness" into compass. Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Rowan, emancipation three years past). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act (placing button, whispering Marcus) crystallizes options and charges the abyss-into-hallway metaphor with visible cost (her night's labor, emotional exposure). Cost is legible in "let the cold unfurl against her skin like a promise." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain: Mira receives the key, waits for drones to pivot, enters the booth, activates the reel, and broadcasts the histories. Orientation anchors (Mira, lagoon, dusk, phone booth) appear early. The closure—officers hesitating as erased voices wash over them—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The line "plans unravel so that better ones can knot" reads as thematic assertion rather than a dramatized shift in stakes or tactics, weakening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the timeframe (thirty-seven dawns, today's session) is legible. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the prophecy's escalating attempts to speak, countered by musical tactics, culminating in the erasure of the prophecy's "last consonant." That erasure constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the prophecy loses its lock on fate) with conceptual cost implied by the knowledge that "tomorrow the prophecy will try to speak again." The causal chain within the accumulative design is clean—each musical gesture tightens the vested hush until the final note erases itself—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through its mosaic structure and lyric repetitions. However, the closure—leaves drifting down, Mireya resuming seed-sorting—lacks visible cost; the "mirror arbor" appears as a reward without forfeiture, and no option is foreclosed on the page. The monuments-to-sky sequence reads as a miraculous solution rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Multiple micro-turns (leaves rise, runes appear, monuments built, moonstone burst) occur, but none narrows options or deepens pressure in a way that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25%: recurring motifs (compass rose, three-seventeen, ashes, leaves) layer meaning and the cellar descent reweights Elias's stance from mending to embracing uncertainty. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he leaves the artifacts, locks the shop, and the final image of clocks frozen at three-seventeen with the admiral legend reconfigures the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The "years later" sailors' legend introduces a second shard that broadens scope without a clean transition cue, creating mild lens wobble, but the final return to the cellar hatch re-anchors and the closure image lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers alchemical ritual, memory, and image toward a Conceptual Repricing where redemption is reweighted as calibration rather than erasure. Orientation anchors (foundry, Aurelia, post-search-party) land early. The closure unit—"names are not chains but counterweights"—reframes the premise, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. The kintsugi mending proceeds without meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (crocodile tooth, harp, giggle, gorge) toward a final dissolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the giggle integrated, the gorge exhales, Elara carries warmth), but the cost is metaphorical rather than legible on the page—no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The "because/therefore" linkage between beats is weak; the giggle pauses "hearing its own reflection" without prior causal setup for why the tooth-on-harp contact would create that effect.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early: anesthesia aftermath, pewter mask, ultraviolet forest. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered equations and proprioceptive flares until the final strap-removal and walk-out constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the protagonist relinquishes the mask, accepts approximation, and walks away with numbers instead of absolution). Cost is legible: "no lighter, but with numbers scribbled along my arms" and the forest's indifference. One causality slip: the interrogator's smile appears as a "proprioceptive spike" memory, but we never learn what confession the narrator gave or why they're seeking mercy, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (alchemist's market, narrator as translator, the fragment) land early. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (painting, cliff, boy-self, lullaby) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the narrator returns the fragment, loop completed, "anchors of intuition settle deeper." Cost is legible in "its absence weighs more than its presence ever did." One meaningful deepening (stepping through the painting, the exchange) satisfies scope. The elliptical structure is taught by the opening frame and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure: recurring motifs (elevators, dust, cracks, the mainspring barrel) accumulate density and the temporal loop deepens stakes without requiring strict causal turns. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara takes the ticket and steps into morning, "weightless, burdened, alive"—a crystallized stance that forecloses theループ and reconfigures her relationship to repair with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Mara, ticket office, 3:07 a.m., seeking the barrel). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the crack in time and sees herself; the loop closes and her decision to leave the barrel reweights all prior repair imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are legible by line four (Corwin, floating deck, post-Shift dawn). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost-patterns, glass fruit chiming, mirrored dissolves build density toward a final image—Corwin walking cloud-sea with type slugs as bells and his name writing itself on distant windows. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the rupture is "not destruction but invitation," and eternity compressed into pocket-glyph reconfigures the premise. However, the cost is asserted ("here the world might breathe") rather than felt in a forfeited relationship, lost ability, or visible tradeoff; we see no on-page consequence that alters Corwin's options after the library folds. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Corwin lost or cannot now do.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes images (mirrors, shard, verses) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the baroque asteroid frame becomes legible before midpoint and the delay charges the setting's strangeness, so orientation penalty is waived. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: Aurelia's dissolution seeds a new crystal and a budding civilization. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique; her body "dissolved" into abstraction rather than a visible forfeiture, and the archaeologist's conversion lacks on-page causal steps, reading as coincidence rather than earned consequence under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (repairman, cathedral chamber, orrery), and the closure—restoring light by offering honest confession and tethering the chip—lands on the page with visible cost (his unfinished lullaby confessed, the chip given up). The causal lens is inferred: Elias's truth-telling enables the rust to release, which powers the orrery. However, the escalation feels linear rather than tightening: he arrives with the solution already in his pocket, and the covenant's test (honesty) is passed in a single beat without complication or reversal. The Cost proof test is met (rust retreats, sky cracks, daughter's lullaby completed), but the single-step resolution limits the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece teaches its method early (petrichor vials, psychometry as texture-gathering) and accumulates through the descent, vial release, and compass dissolution. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ivy becomes "hinge herself," the compass settles as a second heart, and the town "smelled forever on the verge of rain"—reconfiguring her role with conceptual cost (she is no longer separate observer). Orientation is clean by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon answers and she sees the lost expedition translated into hush. The cost is conceptual and felt in the final image, though the exact price (what she cannot return to) could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words (Maela, archway, GPS failure), teaches a lyric pattern early (spirals, perpetual learning, layered meanings), and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the carved archway becomes a conduit, storm pauses, shadows scatter into gulls, Maela rows outward choosing the unmarked map. The final image reweights velocity-as-arrival and escape-as-letting-go with felt cost (GPS drowned, old coordinates abandoned). One meaningful deepening: the slide dissolves into sculpture, charging the closure. Closure coheres under the accumulative lens with conceptual cost legible in the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates seasonal imagery and artistic reflection toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding why flowers bloom at night). Cost is implied—she leaves the pavilion, walks west—but the on-page moment of renunciation or reconfiguration lacks felt weight; the "dawning hush" remains a lyric assertion rather than a decisive image that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed: we learn "amber pavilion in autumn" early, but no grounded where-anchor (city, region) or concrete when-cue until "late-October sun." The piece teaches a mosaic pattern (seasons, postcards, vines) but the closure unit is diffuse across multiple paragraphs rather than a single charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page: Mireya's broadcast is a Decisive Change with social and personal cost visible in "crown me or crucify me" and the act itself. Lens: Causal; the lagoon's retrocognitive cipher drives each beat, narrowing options until she trades her future for the past, then acts. Orientation anchors early (zeppelin, archivist, lagoon by ~80 words). One meaningful tightening when she offers her own death-date and the final page surfaces. Cost is legible in the irreversible broadcast and futures closing "like doors."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments, lantern-making, and ritual layering intensify toward the closure image of kinetic memory versus bottled comfort. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—burying the bottle, committing to monthly burnings, and naming streets constitutes a refusal with visible cost (solitude, endless labor). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the alchemist realizes the bottle "wanted to ingest the civilization" and chooses refusal, narrowing options and charging the final image with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Ambrose, rooftop orchard, post-foghorn dawn) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: foghorn silence → wax shaving → prophecy → immersion memory → quinces with faces → ledger inscription → final transmutation. The closure is Conceptual Repricing—Ambrose becomes the city's grief archive—legible and purposeful. Cost is conceptual (he will answer "in a voice neither alive nor dead") but not felt as a trade-off that closes off another on-page option. One tightening (immersion triggers child-memory) deepens the prophecy's personal stake, satisfying the length default.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to circulation stance): she splits the bead, integrating half into seeds and half into herself, then walks out as "spiral bearer." The lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery, cadence shifts, density increase around the vortex sequence). Cost is conceptual and relational—she becomes the new axis, carrying spirals forward—but the on-page price is oblique; we see the cap "now empty of seeds but full of spirals" without a dramatized forfeiture or visible tradeoff in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses "circulation" over preservation or surrender, narrowing options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara leaves the toggle in place, crystallizing her stance that "tracking microclimate variations was never about prediction but about courtesy," and the city retains the ghost of six notes—a felt cost that reconfigures the station's century of vigilance. The causal lens holds cleanly: barometer drops trigger the rope's tug, which motivates her switch, which produces the bell's resonance and valley wonder. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when anchored in opening lines). One meaningful tightening occurs at 03:59 when she presses the switch, narrowing options from siren to bell with irreversible consequence. The phrase "after the glue dries" recurs with charged meaning at closure, elevating thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through the nightly ritual of speaking to meteors until the vision catalyzes understanding. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the janitor walks away having traded the lantern's glow for internalized openness), and the felt cost—leaving the station, abandoning the physical light—is legible on the page. However, orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's cosmic framing, and the vision's mechanics (touching the fleck, folding into "black water") introduce a supernatural turn without prior rule-teaching, weakening causal coherence even under an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Alden, abandoned beekeeping oasis, post-ghost world) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual repetition, the child's arrival, and the fracture's discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Alden's vow to hold the words and the sealing of the fracture reconfigures the covenant with visible cost—his broken silence and permanent binding to the oasis. The final image (gleaming box, sealed fracture, scent of clover) reweights prior desolation. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches a pattern of sensory accumulation (dust motes, light tasting like iron, footsteps as Braille) that reweights the central question by the ending. Orientation anchors are present early (timekeeper, emerald silo, dawn, post-number world). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "to rediscover time was not to measure but to exchange sensations, each narrative heartbeat a coin." The cost reads as conceptual—abandoning quantification for ephemeral exchange—and the dispersal at dusk signals passage without claiming decisive change. One tightening occurs when the boy rewrites the urn fragment's tag, shifting the timekeeper's stance from collector to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who (poet), where (lagoon), and when (morning after storm) within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers fragments and images toward a resonant final statement. However, the closure—"Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use"—functions as a thematic declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The woman's arrival and departure, the spiral's dissolution, and the feather's transfer are gestures that accumulate but do not crystallize a before/after with visible stakes or forfeited options. No meaningful tightening narrows the poet's choices; the horizon "felt wounded" at the start and remains a meditative object at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—copper circuit completion accumulates toward a single cadence shift when "the orchard answered with a low chime" and creatures "felt the treaty settle into marrow." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes interspecies respect with undeniable pressure, though the cost is conceptual (her departure, the transfer of pulse to the system) rather than viscerally felt. Orientation anchors promptly (caretaker, orchard, six months, morning). One meaningful deepening occurs when the diary page wrapped around copper junction literalizes the transfer. Minor penalty: the "treaty" metaphor becomes over-explicit in the final third, nudging tell over dramatized show.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (tower, spring, after first contact). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Mara follows sculpture-path footprints, climbs, activates the amber, inhales spores, experiences vision, descends as the tower collapses, plants the shard. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the amber becomes "a record" of decay rather than a map of return—with conceptual cost (abandoning the chase). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spores trigger the vision, reweighting her hypothesis. Minor causality question: the tower's collapse mechanism is unexplained and feels convenient rather than earned by her action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the coachman arrives, performs a ritual with seed pods and dead languages, and the battlefield transforms into a garden. Orientation is prompt (jetty, twilight, reef-death context within the first 120 words). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the battlefield becomes a grove, the treaty is kept, and the coachman commits to carrying seeds forward—with conceptual cost (the dead languages are spent, their "purpose served"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the seeds blossom and release the treaty's chord, reweighting the opening stakes. However, the cost feels more asserted ("purpose served," "never carry weapons again") than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint at the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a situational closure), which holds through the ending. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Scraps retires fully, the leaf is set down, and "closeness had always been the only distance worth traveling" reweights the quest with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph (Scraps, Half-mast, post-war) without penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cylinder reveals coordinates, narrowing the search and forcing the journey; the brother's rescue completes the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (frost, maps, compass needle) culminating in the folded corridor. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael and Mother drawing endlessly reweights the anniversary ritual with conceptual cost (time itself becomes meaningless). Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The piece teaches its lyric-temporal pattern early and holds it. Cost is implied in the final image ("years had lost their meaning") but could be sharper—what specific agency or future did Kael forfeit on the page?

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece sustains an Accumulative/Textural lens: images layer (frozen bells, chess secrets, shadow stairs) and the final handoff reconfigures the apprenticeship motif with a felt passing of the mantle. Closure cost is present but oblique—Vespers walks away unburdened, which reads as liberation rather than forfeiture, muting the sacrifice. The chess match functions as a Charged Poise beat where stakes crystallize, yet the swap of the carved bishop (the teaching "how to fall upward") enables the resolution through a rule introduced in that moment, creating a minor convenience slip. Orientation is taught early (spire, sky wrong, chivalrous thief) and the shard structure (climb, match, descent, handoff) holds a single contiguous arc, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered gesture (walking-as-writing, chess pieces, gallery whispers) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara and Kestrel collaborate to extend the game "until dawn." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (palace, whispering gallery, interregnum context). The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—options crystallize around preserving "small gestures" with the next ruler's arrival imminent—though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel's arrival shifts Mara's solitary archiving into a shared act of resistance, narrowing her tactics and reweighting the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (mercury-glass seer, labyrinthine bookstore, after remembering becomes painful) arrive early and remain stable. The causal chain is clear: she buried talents to escape soldiers → returns because home's shape has slipped → finds stone → custodian demands she replant → she refuses and breaks her reflection → escape with stone → seals it permanently. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (refusal to replant + sealing the stone = Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she loses oracle abilities permanently and releases the town from her guilt. One micro turn (custodian's offer) tightens pressure before the final choice. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; escalation follows because/therefore linkage cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marek completes the gesture of righting the king, the village resumes, and he walks toward the road "now simply walking" with the king in his pocket—a quiet acceptance that forecloses the circling of regret with felt cost (exile ends, but the daughter's fate remains unknown). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered chess metaphor, frayed-thread decoding, and labyrinth-walk until the final cadence shift ("The board is wider than the mistake") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (exiled tutor, time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marek realizes the labyrinth is a mirror, not a lock, and walks it to separate remorse from shame. Cost is visible: he accepts that teaching means forgiving the teacher, carries the king as token, and leaves without knowing if reconciliation is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira accepts the cost, the spire cracks, and she walks away doubled by echo, foreclosing the ritual path with visible consequence. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery (ribbons of light, echoes multiplying, mist-shapes) and the cadence shift at "I accept the cost" reweights the stake. Causality is clean within this lens (mirror → light → echo → crack → feather → departure), though the mechanics of "accepting" remain slightly abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when listening replaces speaking, narrowing her tactic and opening the fissure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure—Lira pressing the charm, the statue healing, the workshop sinking—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost (her life) and reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens: her action triggers the statue's healing, which transfers weight and destroys the chains. The sequence is motivated and traceable, with one meaningful tightening when she counts chains down and chooses to proceed. The Orientation Test waiver applies: the opening anchors who (Lira), where (workshop on acid sea), and what (studying the statue) by the second paragraph. Minor slip: the logic of "transferred weight of every restored memory" causing chain breakage is thematically resonant but mechanically vague—does memory have mass in this world, or is it symbolic pressure? The ambiguity does not break causality but softens the causal precision slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; the piece accumulates density through nested images (mirror cracks → harbor erased → shell holds perfect quay → canvas copy → wedged offering) that reweight the dominant stake of preserving what demolition will erase. Orientation anchors (dawn, rented room, quay, coastal cleft) land early. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the hidden painted quay "keeping its perfect hour forever, while above, the real coast forgot itself" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—permanence achieved only through invisibility and renunciation. Cost is legible in the act of wedging the shell where "no human eye would ever see" and boarding with "empty hands."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: the protagonist performs a ritual sequence (climbing, adjusting the beacon, descending to the garden, floating the cork, beckoning the boat) that layers sensory and symbolic material toward a final image. However, causality is weak—each step feels inevitable by authorial design rather than arising from constrained choice or escalating pressure. The closure image (the boat changing course, the protagonist's realization about her mother) offers conceptual repricing, but the cost remains abstract and felt rather than visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with purposeful compression and a lyric pattern taught early. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (navigator, signal station, midnight, post-hydraulic failure). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): she becomes the offering, her body transforms into the reclaimed geography, and the final image of white flowers offers raw solace to future navigators. Cost is legible—she loses corporeal integrity, compass hand and sextant eye detach, she becomes place rather than person—but the accumulation feels more decorative than tightening; each ritual step (hydraulic spiral, hair soldering, voice into censer) adds texture without narrowing options or raising stakes measurably until the final step. The because/therefore linkage within the lyric mode is present but diffuse across many small beats rather than a single decisive pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered images (nooses, storms, truffles that remember) and the pattern of occlusion versus revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis) when the protagonist drinks "not to erase, but to carry them more gently." Cost is legible: the choice to witness rather than silence forecloses the escape route. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (ravine, forager, basket). The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: gaps accumulate (no gulls, missing ferry horn, delayed reflection) until Maris's release of the flower triggers a reversal where each gap closes in sequence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she pays the debt by surrendering her own memories, forecloses the stranger's cycle, and returns to her keeper role with clean isolation. The cost is legible on the page—specific memories named and lost—and the final image of the opal dock "like a closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light" reconfigures the premise with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal chain: map shop discovery → ants lead → cavern doorway → choice to enter. However, the closure—stepping through the doorway as "the old life" washes away—lacks visible cost on the page; we see no foreclosed option or felt price, only assertion. The drive lens reads as Causal, and it holds, but the decisive change is told rather than dramatized with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: bleeding starlight and ember imagery recur and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen becomes the loop's origin, fireflies signal continuity). Cost is conceptual—erasure and loop acceptance—but legibility at closure is diffuse; the final image ("hidden crown burned gently somewhere above clouds") names cost obliquely rather than showing a concrete before/after. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within ~120 words; one transition (climb to ridge crest) is clear. Causality relies on dream-memory rather than protagonist agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds images early (shell spiral, pocket-suns, ember nexus) and returns to them with reweighted meaning at closure. The crushing of the pocket-sun is a Decisive Change with visible cost—he destroys his product and its commercial logic. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One substantive weakness: the middle reflection on "capturing presence" and "scientifically romantic paradox" summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, flattening pressure briefly before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece layers prophetic scroll, dream-eagle flight, grave vision, and snow erasure into a coherent meditation on narrative as survival tool. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, mountain) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure—laying the scroll on snow, watching it vanish, then turning inside to chronicle again—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (accepting the wheel, relinquishing linear rescue). One meaningful deepening: the realization that "erasure is also a form of continuation" reconfigures her stance from escape to endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story deepens through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid)—Mira recognizes that "maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark" and pockets the screw as keepsake. Cost is felt (she will not regain smell but has found alternate meaning), and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. One persistent constraint (anosmia) shapes her stance throughout. The lengthy middle section leans on interpretive reflection rather than on-page micro-choices that alter present options, which slightly softens escalation legibility under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (floating rock, mossy underside, kettle hissing without sound) and maintains it through storm imagery and rune-work beats. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (floating platform, tatami circle, Lina at northern edge). One meaningful tightening occurs when the twelfth stroke seals and crystallized breath shatters into luminous sentences, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) where scars become speakable words. Cost is legible: the crow-quill splits, the platform rises, and Lina leaves the tool behind as proof she no longer needs bated-breath ritual. A brief causality seam appears when motes "soaked into the fibers like ink reclaiming itself"—the mechanism of Master Jomei's exhalation pushing them feels slightly scaffolded rather than inevitably linked to prior rune logic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (perfume, music notation, silence/rest) and builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the exorcist speaks the apology and the sister responds "Play the rest; that's where I live." Orientation anchors quickly (archive, exorcist, perfume bottle). Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift—chainsaws outside compress time, pages swirl, the drop finally falls—and closure reweights the dominant stake (reconnection via acknowledging silence rather than erasing it). Cost is somewhat legible: the exorcist leaves the bottle and accepts the "echo," but the sister's easy forgiveness and the closing lilac bloom soften the price, preventing a fully decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: who this witness is, where precisely she stands, when this occurs within any stake-driven timeline. The "universe's hiccup" functions as handwave rather than constraint. No causal linkage—she arrives, wanders, kneels, exits—each beat could be reordered without altering outcome. The closure ("the curve unifies") is asserted conceptually but lacks visible cost or a before/after that changes options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through recurring motifs (razor edges, fjord quiet, counting backwards) and attempts closure via Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraphs where Torvald dissolves into abstraction. However, the orientation window is heavily delayed—who, where, and when remain impressionistic past the 120-word mark, creating initial disorientation that the lyric mode never fully anchors. The closure unit lacks visible cost: Torvald's realization that "time was never something we moved through but rather something that moved through us" is philosophically asserted but not dramatized with forfeiture or stakes-shift on the page. Causality is elliptical throughout, which suits the lyric mode, but the final transformation reads as metaphysical claim rather than legible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (library, post–heart attack, Mira with lantern). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: scrawls accumulate, the diary deepens understanding, and the final subway loop + page-leaving ritual reconfigures her stance from refusal to openness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira leaves the unlit candle and walks out "wider," reweighting her relationship to her father's contradictions. Cost is oblique—she relinquishes anger and the need for tidy resolution—but the final image ("not lighter, but wider") makes the trade legible. One pressure tightening: the diary entry forces her to see "the lattice of love beneath the ruin."

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (recurring disc hum, loop imagery, nightly ritual) and deepens through the child's calls, building to a coherent closure unit. The protagonist's final act—clipping the wires and walking toward "the first honest ending"—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (abandoning the booth, breaking the loop). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman reveals herself and the gate opens, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible in the protagonist's renunciation of the booth and the emergency call left unanswered.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (archivist, blooming jetty, twilight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the archivist relinquishes the locket, sealing it with the boy's name, and the final waltz with her daughter reweights the archival act as ongoing presence rather than loss. The cost is visible: "steep absence like a clean nail wound." Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift (security interruption, sealing the tube, the confrontation at home) that tightens the stake of preserving small moments. One persistent constraint (demolition deadline) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the station accumulates pilgrims, stories, and sprouting seeds until the clock spins forward. Orientation is present early (Kit at platform three, dawn ritual). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kit boards the train, station promises to keep loneliness in lost-property), but the cost is oblique—what exactly does Kit forfeit by leaving? The narrative asserts "when the story changes, the teller must leave" without on-page stakes to make that departure costly or urgent. Felt cost is implied but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory layering (moss, ultrasonic leaves, musical notes) that tightens into the stillpoint clearing where the ring releases hoarded languages into raised lines. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the mapmaker becomes map/reader/parchment, internalizes the cartography, carries it forward), and cost is legible: the ring empties, the clearing seals, but he now bears unmapped feelings as "raised ink of his palms." Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One friction: the middle spiral could narrow options more sharply; pressure accumulates through density rather than a decisive tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the anomaly's pressure accumulates through image and metaphor until the final "unbending" action reweights prior material. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira reframes her "wrong seeds" as "merely early" and plants new spiral-questions, with the anomaly's hum functioning as both apology and invitation. Cost is legible in the power drain, floating moment, and the commitment to remain "uncertain enough." Orientation anchors (Mira, Station Lagrange-9, viewport, three cycles ago) arrive within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pen's scratch alters filaments and the child's laughter shifts from mockery to companionship. Mild penalty: the causal chain from pen-scratch to filament-shift to timeline-revision is asserted more than dramatized, and the "pre-threshed" paradox in paragraph four introduces light causal fog that slightly undercuts traceability.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines, and the timeframe "when no one remembers you" is taught as a recurring motif. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the advisor moves counterclockwise, subtracting noises in sequence, culminating in a final chord that reweights the harbor's silence into music. However, the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration via the collective note and the camera left on the capstan—lacks visible cost: the advisor simply walks away, and the townspeople's new awareness of silence is asserted rather than shown to foreclose a prior option or demand a trade-off. The story teaches a pattern (subtract, gather, release) but the final image does not make a felt price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Ember is and what she seeks emerges gradually through exposition rather than anchored action. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal (following clues) but resolves through summary revelation rather than on-page discovery. Closure occurs as explained transformation ("understood then") without a decisive beat where options narrow or cost becomes legible. The archive collapse and her emergence are recounted, not dramatized, so no felt price lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—memories accumulate, pressure deepens via drumming and immersion, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "no longer a fugitive guinea pig but a conductor emeritus"). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Mira, garden, escape). The escalation from "trying to externalize" to "teaching harmony" lacks an on-page causal turn or visible cost that forecloses the prior tactic; the shift reads as realization-by-assertion rather than dramatized friction. The lagoon sequence does deepen the stake (identity vs. chorus), and the final image reconfigures her stance, but the cost—what she loses or sacrifices to become "conductor emeritus"—is implied rather than made tangible in a concrete forfeiture or action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (situational pressure of the storm/labyrinth meeting + accumulative discovery pattern). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly: geomagnetic storm, port labyrinth, Mira as maintenance worker. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth reweights from storage system to acoustic whisper network—but the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path with felt consequence. The "prove it worked" motivation lands as thematic declaration rather than earned dramatic pressure, and the Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Mira or the stranger pays a visible price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece accumulates sensory and symbolic density—shutters, dental mirror, spiral reflection—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: darkness "pulsed quietly with remembered starlight," reweighting the guardian's grief into a carried ember. Cost is felt (tears, the ghost of the drowned child), though the reconfiguration is primarily atmospheric rather than a decisive forfeiture of a live option. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers symbolic density (grotto, windows, sapling) toward a final reconfiguration where "quiet is louder than shouting." Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (cobalt library, Coach Mara, evening). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the rebellion "took root" and questions will "grow like moss"—but the conceptual cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page consequence shows what Mara or the town forfeits by planting "forests of second thoughts." The midnight window-display sequence unfolds in summary ("one by one she visited") without a meaningful tightening or obstacle that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the island detaching, the whale's call, and Lira's sung response build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community chooses to follow the whale-song rather than anchor to violent ground. The cost—releasing the old ground and Brine Jack's legacy—is legible in the sinking scrimshaw and the dissolution of "the old ground." Orientation is clear early (Lira at the pier, post-gunpowder transformation), and the closure reweights prior material without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line ~8. The piece accumulates density through whittling repetition, crow exchanges, and the bouquet's transformation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the performer plants bare stems and narrates absent watering until the sky responds. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—suspension of performance, acknowledgment of weight—and the lens holds through the final image of the flag for the morally ambiguous. One meaningful deepening (the planting and sky's tear) reweights the remade hush with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines and the piece holds single-POV across a continuous scene. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of image and cadence shift rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "boundary" and "law" as "rough draft of light"—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: no tactical path is foreclosed, no relationship severed, no body marked. The lake's transformation and the poet's forward motion read as triumph without visible sacrifice, weakening the CR's undeniability.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Milo's renunciation of painting with felt cost ("never painted again, but his arrangements continued speaking"). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern-building through plant arrangements, the reed, and glass shards that converge at the spiral garden closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the marble eye teaches Milo to "see through the cracks" (line 13), reweighting his quest. Minor orientation debt: "glassblower's courtyard" and "after phoenix rises" anchor setting and time early, but Rosa's workshop entrance (line 4) and the three-day sequence feel compressed without clear spatial or temporal markers between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague through the opening paragraph (−0.4). The closure—"Why do we mourn the silence when we could be learning its music?"—is stated rather than dramatized, lacking visible cost or a decisive change in options. The lens wavers between accumulative (golden shadows, spiral pattern) and causal (the question "propels" change), but neither holds consistently, and the ending reads as thematic summary rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with felt pressure. No single on-page sentence demonstrates cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but weakens because the "work" of placing origami figures unfolds as iterative description without meaningful tightening or deepening—each placement restates the same thematic content. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she will leave and change her craft), but the cost is asserted in summary ("carrying loss not as a burden") rather than made visible on the page. The coordinates mechanic is introduced but never narrows options or creates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through measured grid-work, card assignments, and the fractal-debt discovery at the Ten of Swords / Four of Pentacles intersection—a meaningful deepening that reweights the premise. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of infinite regressing cartomancers and the tin-sealed protocol establishes cost (her prophecy unheard, her work a ghost protocol for an uncertain inheritor). One causal seam: the leap from "repeating sigil of leveraged debt" to "infinite regression of exits" compresses insight without showing the logical bridge on the page, risking a tell-not-show at the story's conceptual hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation remains vague throughout—who, where, and when are never anchored concretely by ~120 words; the archive's geography and the protagonist's physical journey are abstract. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no single meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; instead, thematic assertions recur without escalation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she removes the veil, shares the pagoda, builds community), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mira internalizes the stone and locks her heartbeat in the vault, forecloses her career, and becomes "the last dusk itself"—a reconfiguration with felt cost on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The escalation operates through symbolic accumulation and cadence shift rather than causal turns, appropriate to the lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone metamorphoses and Mira understands her mother's choice, then a second when she internalizes it. The lens holds and the closure image reweights prior material with visible cost (career ended, shadow/heartbeat locked away, self transformed into afterimage).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and sustains a causal accumulative lens: each shedding action (ring, braid, pages, tail-tip plaque) narrows Miren's options and deepens her commitment to reconstruction. Closure arrives through Earned Stasis—she releases Aster and accepts doubt as the new foundation—with visible cost (professional identity dismantled, creatures lost). The final image of the empty cage and glowing plaque lands the reconfiguration. One micro slip: the transition from interior workshop to exterior field is compressed but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the scar as a "period" rather than a question mark, achieves the miracle's displacement, and gains a new relationship to grief. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and motif convergence (coffee rings → tunnel, hourglass → red sand, seed swallowed) reweight the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs underground when the miracle demands "fresh loss" and blood becomes language. Cost is legible: the wound reopens, blood is given, and the protagonist carries a new story "heavier by one story." Minor ellipsis at the underground descent is purposeful compression that the piece teaches early.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (film strip, projection, auditorium echo) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation anchors (Mara, projection booth, present night) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure attempt is a Conceptual Repricing: "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it," reweighting the premise of grief as retrieval into grief as circulation. Cost is asserted ("ashes in her pocket") but the felt price is thin; the letter's blank-to-complete transformation and the sudden appearance of the cigarette case both arrive as gifts rather than dramatized struggle. The causal chain from psychometry reading → projector self-threading → screen playback → found object relies on coincidence resolving rather than complicating, which weakens escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it through to closure: sensory density builds, the aurora descends, the instrument is dismantled and reassembled into a body-map, and the protagonist dissolves into light. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she becomes part of the sky's sentence, her body traded for perpetual creative transmission—with conceptual cost made legible in the final image. Orientation is delayed (who/when anchor by ~180 words) but the disorientation serves the lyric pattern and pays off at closure, so the penalty is waived. One meaningful deepening occurs when she lies inside the instrument-constellation and the aurora threads her outline.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (frozen clock, archive, wave functions) and pays it off through density increase and charged imagery at closure. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening line (guard, dune, post-forest timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the guard plants the clock, the sparks transfer to pollen children, and the final image reweights the archive motif with conceptual cost (lullabies persist, cargo travels by wave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clock's hands split and the strongbox sheets fly out, narrowing the guard's task to a single ritual act. Cost is legible in the transfer of light and the guard's lighter coat, though the cost reads more conceptual (duty completed, sparks handed off) than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece cycles through images (gear, jaguar, mercury brook, shore, tree) with cadence modulation. Orientation anchors emerge late—"copper canopy of the mechanical rainforest" in line one, but who/where/when stabilizes only after ~150 words. The closure (becoming a tree) registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she turns away from the metro and roots herself), and the cost is implied in "departure is just another branch," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she drops the gear, narrowing her identity, yet the transformation reads more as reward than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors are deliberately veiled—the "shoreline," "ridgeway," and "crossing between worlds" remain atmospheric rather than grounded—past the ~120-word threshold without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure; apply −0.4. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hound chooses her role), but the cost is told ("no longer bound by leash but by choice") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off. The causal engine is weak: the guides walk, find the hound at a cliff "that shouldn't exist," stamp her, and balance restores via assertion rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring motifs (bolt, staircase discoloration, snow) toward a final image that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is Charged Poise—the boy's tightening grip on the bolt crystallizes the cycle of silence with undeniable pressure—but the cost remains implied rather than felt on the page. The shift from bellhop witnessing to boy inheriting the role reconfigures meaning, yet the final paragraph's conditional phrasing ("perhaps...when the snow finally ceased") weakens the immediacy of the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure gathers through imagery (ink pellet, library dust, constellation pause) toward the sundering moment. Orientation anchors "ancient temple library" and "diminutive titan" early, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (glamour sundered, pretender exposed), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse: no on-page consequence for the titan (he simply walks away) and the pretender's unmasking lacks immediate repercussion beyond the description of melting features. The causal spine—titan searches, leaves clues, ink touches skin, glamour unravels—holds, but the ink pellet's mechanics (why it "waited for a reader who could feel the ache of drift") are asserted rather than dramatized, and the final beat (guards burst in, titan flicks the droplet) resolves without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by paragraph two (Mira, station, post-ban lagoon). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues gather (hollow metal, atlas page, sonar taps, submerged ruins) and the descent deepens mystery through sensory intensification until the hologram reweights her witness role. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her task was never proof but memory-keeping for regrowth—with the cost felt in the sealed atlas page and her resumed vigil. One meaningful deepening occurs (clues → dive → pillars → hologram), though the protagonist's agency in that sequence is more reactive than decisive. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening (who, where, when by line three). The piece follows a causal chain: whistle → stone hum → crane climb → shuttle ignition → broadcast, each beat motivated by the prior. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (she launches and broadcasts the lullaby, reopening the sky), and the cost is visible (she leaves the planet, breaks curfews below). However, the stone circle's mechanics arrive conveniently without prior constraint, and the shuttle "long thought scrap" reviving on a lens-focused light beam stretches credibility. The causal lens holds, but convenience at the climax prevents entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (volcanic springs, reconstruction, Nara with amber) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads Causal with Situational accent: the kite riddle → coordinates → grotto immersion sequence causally narrows options and the final vial-sealing forecloses the council's program with visible cost (altered DNA, concealed embryo). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Nara's act reweights "implanted destiny" with undeniable pressure, though the child's future remains open. No major causality breaks; the moss convenience noted in Q1 does not fracture the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator enacts a covenant to "live as the trees live, damaged yet upright," releasing the photograph with visible cost and replacing physical token with embodied ritual. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered sensory anchors and the final cadence shift ("air tastes not of metal but of possible mornings") reweights the grief-optimism stake. Orientation is immediate (arboretum, dusk, sole survivor). One meaningful deepening occurs when the photograph is pressed to bark and released, foreclosing the daily unfolding ritual with felt cost. The lens holds without contradiction; causality is woven through repeated visits and the somatic exercise paying off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with clear anchors (lighthouse, library, Elian) established early. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: Elian completes the "redesign" by stepping through the mirror into the sea, accepting fragmentation as a "truer fracture." However, the cost is more asserted than demonstrated—what specific option or relationship is foreclosed on the page remains vague. The final image reweights prior material but the felt price is diffuse, limiting high-band access.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: ink patterns and journal fragments layer toward a conceptual repricing at closure—time's elasticity reweights the premise of "crisis slowdown." However, the closure unit depends on summary exposition ("They had discovered…") rather than a charged final image, and cost is asserted rather than felt on the page. The causal chain from bootprint → drone → ink portal → willing vanishing reads thin; Kael's decision lacks a prior beat that narrows options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines; the causal chain from waking → discovering the letter → recognizing the council's deception → uploading through dormant networks → sealing herself back into cryo is legible and motivated by Sera's established purpose. The closure unit—Sera re-entering the pod as the city responds—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize (the conversation is now public, the library will stand or burn) with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page. One minor causality hiccup: the "emergency lights painted the aisles red, then blue, then white" and "distant explosions" arrive almost simultaneously with her upload, compressing response time in ways that strain plausibility. The inferred lens is Causal with some Accumulative layering (recurring "dizzying quiet," snow imagery); it holds through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through returning images (roses, canvas, blood-soaked earth) and shifts from destruction to growth. Orientation anchors early (greenhouse, three days post-tower fall). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira plants the hybrid cutting in the exact spot where her father's airbag fell, crystallizing her philosophy of transformation with the felt cost of accepting both violent and peaceful threads. The final image reweights prior material (father's restless spirit finding rest), though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the sound garden, spike, and voicing-silence build density until the goddess arrives and Mara's action (driving the spike) forces a reversal. Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration—she "understood then that divinity is not a catch but a conversation" and releases herself into the echo—with felt cost (the shift from hunter to listener, the renunciation of capture). Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Mara, sound wave garden, tonight). One meaningful tightening occurs when the spike channels all vibrations and traps the goddess's echo, reweighting the premise from capture to exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the orbit-breaking ritual accumulates pressure through layered metaphor until the ellipse cracks and "The story continues" reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (observatory, Cordelia, Dr. Orlan). The closure—regret becoming "merely another planet in a spacious sky"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with cost legible in the splintered nib and her descent. One meaningful deepening (the proof-by-contradiction sequence) tightens options and the final image reconfigures the dominant stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational (guilt-pressure accumulates through imagery and console interaction). Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: the lab is reframed from archive to parasite, and the final choice (RELEASE INSECT) frees the lullaby and husks the amber, reweighting guilt into "forgiven sleep." Cost is legible in the image of the emptied amber and quieted collarbone. However, the console's three-option menu structure and the sudden revelation that "the laboratory did not store lost sounds; it cultivated them" arrive late without prior anchoring, weakening causal momentum. The Orientation Test is borderline: "laboratory of lost sounds" and "console" anchor place and object by the second paragraph, but "when time folded in on itself" remains atmospheric rather than functional until the retrospective vision, delaying full spatial/temporal grounding past ~150 words.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mandala ritual accumulates sensory and conceptual density until the final scattering reweights the premise of impermanence as creative engine. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the flake's whisper ("The mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you") and the scattering gesture reweight the opening stake of discovering meaning in erasure. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of transience) but felt in the final image of "pockets empty except for the memory of lilac unease." The tightening is a single meaningful deepening rather than a causal reversal, which fits the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts a mosaic structure (three months of visions → one night's work → departure → legend) but the transitions are summative rather than dramatized, flattening causal linkage. Orientation is delayed: who Asha is and why she's alone in the ruins isn't anchored until deep in the second paragraph. The closure—Asha's departure and the plaza's organic growth—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("what we allowed ourselves to forget") rather than made undeniable through a concrete final image or choice. The orientation debt and summarized key beats prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are delayed (stage ghost, closed theater, hedge maze) but comprehensible by ~15% without penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the ghost receives the applause he sought and his form sharpens, carrying an "endless encore" forward. Cost is implied (Lila vanishes, orchard dims) but not felt as a trade-off or foreclosure—he gains satisfaction without visible sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs (coin-threading ritual → blooming backward → applause from leaves), but the protagonist's agency is minimal; Lila provides the method and the garden responds mechanically. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift at the orchard stage are present, but the cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: static shock activates the geode, which reveals light patterns, leading to the thought-shield solution. Orientation anchors (Mira, basement studio, post-recall timeframe) arrive clearly. The closure—Mira becomes a beacon and reflects on trusting science and intuition—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; her private refuge becomes public without dramatizing what she loses. The escalation from personal discovery to community healing proceeds in summary beats ("dozens, then hundreds") that compress key turns, weakening the causal chain at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aera transforms from solitary mapper to guide-voice, embedding herself into stone so future wakers can follow. The cost is legible—she will "dissolve into rumor"—and the staff's perpetual float offers a charged final image. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory data, ancestral memory, and sonic ritual until the cave walls "re-illuminate" with cooler, steadier colors, signaling a decisive reweighting. One friction: the mystical mechanics (heat-glyphs, sound-as-weather, fossil-to-seed) are asserted rather than constrained by rules, so escalation feels more like unveiling than tightening. Orientation is clear early (coastal cave, post-hibernation, Aera alone), satisfying the test.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through cataloging, sensory layering, and pattern-making rather than causal because/therefore chains. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy's threat ("the world will narrow to a thread") is reweighted by the final image of buttons as "a garment we button together." However, cost remains abstract; the felt price of this realization is asserted through metaphor ("hourglass heart inverted") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or embodied consequence. The orientation is delayed—"hourglass turner" and "amber warehouse" are named early, but the inciting crack and the Abbott's declaration arrive only after scene-setting, creating mild disorientation in the first 15% that never fully pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (burned spy, cliffside path, spring mist) arrive early and hold. The causal chain is clean: pillbox micro-code → slate cipher → listening station → transmission, with each beat motivated by prior knowledge. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he transmits the confession, crushes the pillbox, and walks into anonymity, forecloses his burned identity with visible cost ("the new scar tissue pulling tight"). One tightening (discovering coordinates, entering the station, sending the signal) is sufficient at this length and the Drive Lens reads Causal with lyric texture. Minor slip: "Where unused courage waits, the snow remembers" functions more as thematic echo than tactical constraint; the phrase does not narrow options as sharply as the coordinates themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagistic density building toward a final reconfiguration; the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the coachman carrying the sphere, walking a new path, palimpsest wiped clean). Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "when" remains deliberately vague. The tightening occurs when the yarn needle is threaded and the thread unspools, collapsing thirty years into a single droplet—a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is conceptual (the coach erased, his old role gone) but legible in the final image of meadow replacing crossing. One persistent weakness: the girl's coordinates and the mechanics of the palimpsest promise are asserted rather than dramatized, creating mild causality gaps in how she knows the timing and why the river "recognizes" the promise.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (hives, bees, apricot, lantern glass) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the oasis is restored through Lin's act of kindness, and memory becomes portable via the lantern glass. Orientation anchors (Lin, oasis, copper sky) arrive early. The escalation operates via density and pattern rather than causal linkage: the thrum deepens, timelines fracture, the clay hive hardens without fire, bees return. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse—Lin walks away, her footprints erasing, carrying the burden of guiding kindness forward—though the specific forfeit or trade-off remains oblique. The mosaic structure (arrival, fractured vision, clay act, restoration, departure, child's arrival) is legible, but the final third loops through multiple vignettes that restate the central image without tightening further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The pattern is taught early—harbor imagery, oar rhythm, fire escape layers—and accumulates through the lock opening, descent, rose petal exchange, rooftop teaching, until the final image (boy descending with lavender, gauge tooth falling to root nasturtium) reweights the opening with conceptual cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy carries "a small reflected moon" into dark corridors, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure even though the social cost remains oblique. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the watering-can climb. One tightening occurs when the locked door forces the theft and use of the gauge tooth, narrowing her tactical options. Cost is legible in the fallen tool and the boy's transformed stance, though the price to Mara herself could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening (gryphon, tidal library, brass sundial, post-reincarnation). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes symbolic weight through recurring images (moonlight, feathers, sundial, stone circle) until the final gesture—stepping backward, rotating the sundial, etching "Alone"—reweights the dominant stake (isolation into independence) with conceptual cost. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): refusal of the chorus forecloses haunting partnership, and the cost is legible in the continued solitude and the blank codex page released as promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the interior crack admits moonlight and reveals "unmapped space," narrowing the path toward singular autonomy. The cost-proof test is satisfied: "stepped backward off the stones," "disappointed yet respectful," and the torn page "addressed to the future" all register renunciation and its price.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors emerge slowly: the protagonist's profession is named early, but the spatial setup (pontoon bridge, circular hall, oculus projection) clarifies only after she enters. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and color-language toward a reconfiguration at closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final "I am here" / "We know" exchange reweights the premise with conceptual cost (decades of ghostwriting, finally claiming her own voice). However, the cost remains largely implied rather than legible in a single on-page image; the sentences scattered as paper airplanes and the crumbling twig offer closure participation, but the emotional price is diffused across metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the town pauses, the tricksters fold "for this orbit," and Lyra's final gesture (hand on transmitter, walking home with charts) crystallizes options with felt cost: temporary reprieve, ongoing vigilance required. The story teaches its layered, dense voice early and maintains coherence. One meaningful tightening occurs at 02:17 when interference peaks and collapses into hush; cost is visible in the "cautiously hopeful" sign-off and the acknowledgment that power plays are "surely already congealing."

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details (organ notes, compass trembling, spatial warping) build density until the geometry "mutinies," opening the shaft. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Arin takes the key, accepting that tunnels close behind her while the future opens—cost is legible in the sealing bargain and the missing glass pane. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass point transfixes shadow, triggering spatial rebellion. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The causal chain from compass → shadow circle → shaft → key → consequence holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece opens with clear anchor (quarry, Juniper, ribbon) and moves through a recognizable causal chain: lamp → ribbon weave → blood → memory → portrait. The closure—delivering the portrait—lands on the page with a relational cost (the detective's tears, the precinct hallway). However, the central turn (recognizing her own braids in the ribbon) relies on a concealed backstory element that the reader cannot anticipate, weakening the felt inevitability of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through Mara's nightly decoding work, the discovery of the micro-maps, and the dirigible expedition, culminating in the corroded helm-log reveal. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening sentence; by ~120 words the reader has anchored, so the Orientation Test is satisfied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara chooses to stay another season, cataloging memory into the sky itself, but this decision is summarized in the final paragraphs rather than dramatized with a live choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (she could leave but stays) rather than felt on the page in a concrete moment. One meaningful deepening occurs (the wreck recovery confirms Edda's sacrifice), but the causal chain from decoding to dirigible launch to stay-decision relies heavily on summary rather than because/therefore linkage in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but closure lacks legible cost—she "steps backward—or forward" onto a bridge "rendered in silver halide and hope," and the final image offers only the violin remaining with a "wink." No decision forecloses a path; the ending dissolves into metaphor without a felt price. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (pullout anchored, but "after the hitchhiker vanishes" timeframe remains vague and the inciting incident is entirely offstage). The piece teaches a pattern of poetic compression but does not pay it off with a resonant reconfiguration that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the first three paragraphs (Jonah, lion-car, dusk, four years post-startup). The dominant stake—breaking the loop of his father's repetition—tightens through the spiral-building ritual and resolves in the final choice to walk away with visible cost (one bill given, the spiral abandoned). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (circus train, foreign money, startup debris) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "some circles are meant to be broken by walking calmly forward") with felt cost. One minor slip: the pivot from Mara's initial goal (burn shirts) to collaborative spiral happens off-page, briefly loosening causal traceability mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative lens: the chronicler arrives, witnesses through the telescope, speaks petal-syllables, and the inscriptions transform. The closure image (stories as "smooth glass" lenses, the whispered inscription) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. The orientation anchors arrive promptly (midnight, observatory, chronicler with telegram), and the lens holds, but the final reconfiguration lacks a visible sacrifice or forfeited path. The "temple would crumble, its purpose fulfilled" is told aftermath rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Briar's spoken confession triggers the plant's selective growth and the vortex's reversal, crystallizing her stance as "guardian and trespasser both" with felt cost—she is now bound and exposed to a world that will judge her. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the expanding-circle structure, each loop adding weight (apples like skulls, mirrored water, the seventh-circle still point) until the confession reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening sentence; the single continuous scene in one location fits 600–800 scope. One minor slip: the "magic trick" that precedes this scene is referenced but never clarifies its intended mechanics, creating a small motivation gap at the inciting edge—though the failure itself drives the present action clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (scars, clipping, maze, fireflies) toward a final grafting that reconfigures the protagonist's role. Orientation anchors appear by ~180 words (cobalt glade, root-bound visionary, maze clipping), meeting the test. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the protagonist becomes a rooted hedge-double to sustain the covenant), but the cost—losing mobility, joining the fireflies—is poetically asserted rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical choice that narrows prior options.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. The orchard barter initiates pressure, the memory exchange deepens it, and the final sprout-and-hum image reweights "patching souls" from sealing to "weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces." Cost is legible: the narrator loses the mother's hum yet hears it echoed externally, and Lira sags hollow. Orientation anchors promptly (catacomb orchard, Lira, narrator's war wounds). One meaningful deepening through the exchange ritual suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraphs and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mason's purpose shifts from appraising value to archiving voices, foreclosing his old pursuit with visible cost (accepting the foreman's new contract terms). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—fragments of Mason's past (Iron Eden, grille cloth, Polaroid) layer toward the closure reweighting. However, the causal chain is loose: the Polaroid note "return the sound" and the free microphone appear conveniently without prior setup, and the foreman's sudden appearance and offer feel unmotivated by Mason's echo experiment. The cost is implied but not sharply legible on the page; we infer Mason relinquishes his solitary appraiser identity, but the foreman's acceptance happens too smoothly to register friction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (translator, arbor, seed) and the piece sustains a clear accumulative/textural lens: density rises through cuneiform micro-glyphs, the mercury filament, the mirrored sky, building to the obsidian plank that extends the bridge. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new plank and the final insight crystallize the mother's pattern without a decisive external act. Cost is conceptual—"haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape"—legible in hindsight but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers image and ritual to build toward a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive gradually but are legible by ~150 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the librarian performs her ritual, reaffirms her commitment, and climbs to continue her work. However, the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no painful trade-off dramatized. The cadence shift in the final beat reweights the dominant stake, but the before/after remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered imagery (pearl, confessions, crown, mirror) and cadence shifts. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Mara becomes permanently embedded in the mirror, tending abandoned hopes—a before/after with conceptual cost (she abandons the convoy and her inspector role). However, the cost remains oblique; the final image of her "walking forever" inside glass feels asserted rather than dramatized with felt consequence on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly, so no penalty applies, but the causal path from confession to crown to mirror-imprisonment relies on symbolic logic rather than motivated escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers symbolic objects (map, accordion, graffiti, underground stream) and coordinates tied to guilt, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + image repricing) when Lila releases the accordion and rewrites her map, forecloses medication-era evasion with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when she steps into the stream and recites coordinates-as-apology, reweighting her chronicler role from evasion to witness. The closure image ("accordion breathing," new line on the map) reconfigures her relationship to guilt with felt cost (instrument lost, medication ghost thanked). Minor: the catalogue of sins is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening causal necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (library feeding on unspoken words) but relies on Causal plot furniture (nine-hour countdown, two letters) that never tightens options. Orientation is delayed—who she is, why she's here, and what the library actually threatens remain vague past the first third. The closure unit (becoming the library) is asserted rather than earned through prior causality; the watch stopping and the thread removal occur without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The "Thank you" letter feels like authorial summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when Lira plays the violin, triggering empire-wide consequences. However, the causal chain depends on convenient external agents: the cereus pushes her decision, the coffee stain reveals the backstory, and the violin's properties are told rather than discovered through action. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (toppled empire, failed harvests), but the cost feels abstract and geographically distant rather than viscerally present in Lira's immediate experience at the moment of playing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a lyric-accumulative lens but never clarifies what options the protagonist weighs or what tactical choice the grotto visit represents—she arrives already committed to dissolution. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only gradually across the first third, and the seven-year backstory competes with present action for primacy. The closure unit (dispersal into aurora) occurs on the page, but the cost reads as aesthetic transformation rather than a felt forfeiture; no prior path is dramatized and then visibly foreclosed. The because/therefore link between "infusing the chip" and "becoming a lantern" bypasses causal steps, reading as metaphoric inevitability rather than motivated escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who (caretaker), where (moon-ash/grotto), and when (after forgiveness) within the opening, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning—repeated motifs (scallop, hairpin, cycle) accumulate toward a conceptual repricing at closure. However, the closure unit itself is diffuse: the caretaker descends, reconciles with her sister, dies, and a girl-child emerges across multiple beats without a single decisive reweighting moment. The cycle's conceptual cost (rebirth demands death) is stated rather than made undeniable through image or action, weakening the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: wind chimes encode doubt, the hollow shard collects grief, dawn light makes particles visible. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (lighthouse, after campfire, research team). Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the researchers stand in "protected vulnerability of not knowing"—but the cost remains atmospheric ("certainty unhooked and flapping") rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through the stone-drop and ring-reveal structure, and the closure—Marcus picking up the stone to repeat the cycle—lands as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the teacher-student loop. However, orientation debt (who Marcus is, why he's "searched too long," and the nature of his stake) persists past 120 words without payoff at closure. The cost of the cycle is asserted ("in five years he would return") but not felt on the page; we do not see Marcus forfeit a path or embody the weight of inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes spatial anchors (canyon, bone towers) but offers no discernible plot causality or escalation—Cael arrives, sings, and merges with the landscape in a single uncontested sweep. There is no obstacle, complication, or choice that narrows options; the "pulse left wandering" resolves instantly when he stops moving, with no on-page cost or forfeited path. The ending asserts transformation ("became the song his people had been trying to sing") but provides no before/after difference in knowledge, capability, or stance that the reader can trace. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), closure requires visible cost; here the final image is decorative summary, not a reconfiguration with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elian, spire balcony, automated-wonder world) arrive within the first ~60 words. Causal-plus-accumulative hybrid lens: the unlocking cantrip → mist stair → algorithms notice → keystone visions → badge-wrapping → stair dissolves form a motivated chain, and the closure (Elian stranded on snow island, credentials gone, drones blind to him) reconfigures options with felt cost—no return to the guild, new invisibility as both trap and freedom. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stair wavers and he must speak to the mist. Cost is legible: "without credentials, the spire's doors would not open."

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though the "meteor hush" remains abstract. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases underwater, the phonograph cylinder provides a tonal crescendo, and the final image (pier lights that "sang the harbor awake in colors they could almost hear") reweights Jin's quest. Cost is conceptual—he leaves the vows sealed—but the price remains oblique rather than legible as a forfeited option or relational shift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to transformation) where Lira swallows the spiral and becomes a waveform. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—"sacrifice" is named but the before/after emotional or relational price is not dramatically visible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the coins cool and she realizes the distillate is sacrifice, but the final beat leans heavily on metaphor without grounding the forfeiture in a concrete, legible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% (observatory wakes, star-sentences form, atlas boat folds) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the reaper steps onto starlight "borrowed rather than stolen," a conceptual repricing with felt cost (the echo "no longer a weight but a pulse"). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the atlas boat capsizes and ink reveals "every soul he reaped had paid some fraction of their death to postpone his own," reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the final image and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip rate and rust-to-minnow imagery build density until the bell cracks and the ocean persists through cultural transmission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ocean endures because remembering becomes collective), with conceptual cost legible in Kael's death and the children's inherited vigilance. Orientation anchors quickly (viaduct, Kael, vanished ocean). The years-long compression sacrifices causal granularity—we jump from ankle-deep water to full whales without on-page escalation of the physical or social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors promptly (Marisol, levee office, draw-down town at twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the photograph trail deepen until the final act—tearing the label, restringing the chime—reconfigures Marisol's relationship to the town's memory with visible cost (she releases private scandal to build shared narrative). Closure lands on the page with felt cost. One micro weakness: the transition from discovering the photos to her interpretive leap ("arranged to expunge something") relies slightly on assertion rather than letting image sequence alone carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (auburn-haired alchemist, waterfall, orchard). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (starlings, mica, quince scent) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where "knowledge and awe fused" with visible cost (the crystal's memory carried forward, the world now "threaded" differently). Escalation proceeds through spatial progression (kneeling → reading starling coordinates → finding crystal → flame ritual → touching the drop), each beat adding sensory and conceptual weight. The closure effect is legible—she steps back "unchanged in form yet rearranged in axis"—though the cost is more conceptual than visceral, and the final paragraph's thematic summary ("every flame, every flock...conspires to teach") edges toward moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release): the protagonist relinquishes the buckle and her vigil, accepting that preservation can mean letting go, with the cost legible in her lightness "by one buckle but heavier by one choice." The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of ritual (tallies, signals, muscle memory) builds until the glider encounter breaks the pattern and the final tally shift reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (arbor, post-radio silence, sky-watcher role) arrive within the first third. One friction: the time-folded older-self device introduces a causal ambiguity (instructor's voice, mirrored eyes) that the text does not fully earn through prior rule-teaching, creating a brief mid-story opacity before the thematic payoff clarifies intent.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (floating dojo, rewritten Pacific, Mara's posture). The custody ritual provides a clear stake, and the brain-pulse escalation builds pressure through complementary-opposite mechanics. Closure lands as a synthesis—one merged figure holding the child—but the cost feels asserted rather than legibly foreclosed: what path did Mara sacrifice on the page? The causal lens holds through the vivification rounds, yet the final dissolution-into-one reads more like fulfillment than renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ellery accepts that "tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry," then places the pull-cord by the hourglass—a visible renunciation of resurrection fantasy with conceptual cost. The accumulative lens holds: density increases through tunnel acoustics, layered lullaby fragments, neighbors' porch lights, wife's chuckle, and the house exhaling "something very like a laugh." Orientation anchors clearly by line four (Ellery Kite, garage, post-loss timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sniffle becomes giggle, forcing Ellery to reframe his project from literal restoration to symbolic haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who (feral guardian), where (frozen garden), and what (nightly approach to a boundary) within the first two paragraphs, establishing the lens as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure unit is Earned Stasis: she refuses passage and returns without the pendant, a renunciation that forecloses reunion with her former self. Cost is visible in the image of the pendant left behind and the "expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur," reweighting her relationship to uncertainty from stranger to companion. The lens holds, but escalation is thin—each paragraph deepens texture without narrowing options until the final turn, which arrives more as thematic capstone than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive quickly and clearly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: frost→ash→steam→creature builds through successive transformations. Closure lands on-page (alchemist becomes blind, creature formed, journey begins) with conceptual cost visible in the scattered lens-dust and acceptance of "the next cage may be stranger." However, the causal chain feels more like alchemical recipe than motivated choice—each step follows ritual logic rather than protagonist decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early (lyric density, motif repetition, atmospheric escalation). Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; lunar perigee provides temporal pressure. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "every quiet is merely rehearsal" realization and the descent as rebirth, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The shard of hush dissolves offstage ("finally dissolved"), denying the reader the on-page moment where stakes crystallize. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs (the shard's true nature revealed as cocoon), but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it announces thematic satisfaction instead.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the grotto arrival and radio contact establish clear before/after markers. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ferry solidifies, passengers return, and Arden steps into "one coherent tomorrow" with brass caps as a token of saved possibilities—visible cost in the crumbled hourglass and the weight of choosing which timeline to pour. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patterns (barnacle coordinates, radio rhythms, hourglass mechanics) build density until the final image reweights the transient life as a permanent, coherent choice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the radio voice warns "only half here" and Arden acts on that cue. Minor causality slip: the grotto's closing pressure and the hourglass's heat arrive suddenly without prior signal, slightly softening the turn's motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: "who" remains abstract until line 11's composite man, "when" (twilight) appears only in line 1, and the spatial anchor (gallery corridors) emerges gradually without grounding the body in a specific room or threshold. The drive lens wobbles between accumulative (weaving patterns, auroras of pigment) and causal (thread altering foundation, composite man dissolving) without teaching a stable mode by midpoint. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed") but the cost is asserted, not demonstrated—no on-page forfeiture or visible price anchors the realization. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (benthic city, post-alien descent, navigation class). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the chain link recurs and reweights meaning, and the final gift to the boy crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she gives away her last relic, accepting that direction begins where fear ends. The cost is legible: "the missing link of the chain left a hollow that ached like lungs remembering air" and "its absence a perfect, navigable void." One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy sights the steady point and receives the link, foreclosing her claim to the surface past. Causality is clean within the accumulative design, and the closure image—pushing away from the spire, ready to teach again—lands with conceptual cost visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Mira hears Lila's pulse → finds the photograph → discovers the ledger → confronts Hask → uploads proof, with each beat motivated by the prior. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Hask collapses, Mira triggers the alarm, and Lila's credit is restored—but the final cost to Mira (removing the hearing aid, sleeping dreamless) reads more as exhaustion than a path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hask corners her at the pond, forcing the bluff and upload.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's descent and witness-bearing returns the technicians from "memory to rumor" back to embodied presence, with the conceptual cost visible in her new obligation to remember. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—causal in the descent sequence (gold fleck guides each stage), accumulative in the naming ritual that progressively thins the lacquer and frees each technician. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (Mara, facility, 1987 station). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches Voss and the phase transition reverses, reweighting all prior material. The cost is legible: "replaced by the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist walks toward the horizon embodying "wisdom fetched from the place where error and miracle share a border," forecloses return, and the shard-to-chest gesture charges the final image with cost. Causality holds: the barcode error → digital ghost → ink defragmentation → corporeal reassembly → clerk encounter → departure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist slices the digital film and descends, narrowing options from observation to embodied intervention. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine; the ink-pattern beat deepens understanding without a traditional reversal, and the ending reweights the premise (life hinges on typo) into a stance (failure is corridor). Minor issue: the "after the radio static clears" timeframe is poetic setup but never tested as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers imagery and ritual beats toward a final reconfiguration. Closure arrives on-page: she becomes a calcified repository, the diamond cracks cleanly, and the language persists in the canyon's acoustics, offering Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (her body, her mortality). Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, bone towers, storyteller). However, the escalation is more processional than pressured—each step (descend, place diamond, wait, speak, swallow, calcify) unfolds without meaningful reversals or narrowing options. The cost is legible but not felt as a struggle; the sequence reads as inevitable ritual rather than hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Mara is, where precisely she stands in the catacombs, and what stakes drive her presence remain murky past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—metamorphosis into the moth-winged collective—occurs on the page, but causality is decorative rather than motivated: the flint arrowhead "warms" and roots "embrace it" through coincidence, not Mara's agency or prior choices. The drive lens wobbles between accumulative/lyric (spirals, frost motifs) and causal (researcher investigates phenomenon), never stabilizing; by closure it reads as passive absorption into a pre-existing pattern rather than a choice or reconfiguration earned by prior beats. No cost is legible—Mara loses her "bitterness" but that loss is framed as pure gain ("incandescent"), and her human form "cracks open" without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (shell, music, seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard transforms and Calla departs. Orientation anchors (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) arrive early. The closure effect (orchard blooms outward, statues root as trees, bridge dissolves) reconfigures the world, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Calla suffers no visible loss, and the shell "dissolving into gold dust" reads as reward, not sacrifice. The middle linkage (lullaby backward → blossoms rise → statues drowse) accumulates density but lacks a tightening choice that narrows Calla's options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing: the thunderstorm-for-letters exchange reconfigures the premise of contraband promises, and the final image of envelopes arriving at doorsteps reweights Riven's role from passive carrier to active reunifier. Orientation anchors who (Riven), where (cobalt arcade), and when (twilight, lone mail drop) within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through layered imagery and constraint (the drone, the welded console, the tunnel)—but causality occasionally blurs: the arcade tokens "spell the route" without prior setup, and the soda-machine key feels convenient rather than earned. One meaningful deepening (kneeling at the console, releasing the storm) tightens the dominant stake with felt cost, but the middle lacks a sharp turn that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and symbolic recurrence (carousel horses, halo fragment, silence-as-music) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when the carpenter internalizes the fragment's promise and walks forward with "a new silence—full, round, and singing." Cost is legible but oblique: he leaves the train without looking back, embodying the shift from repair to interpretation. Orientation is delayed (no clear "who" anchor until paragraph 3), but the disorientation serves the lyric mood and does not obscure the closure image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—layered images of hyperbolic geometry, pre-narrative spaces, and dimensional mapping. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after ~200 words of abstract setup, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (stories live in hyperbolic folds, Ms. Penumbra stitches topology), but cost remains assertion-only: "helped awaken" and "already cataloging" describe outcomes without showing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs (scarf warms → she steps between shelves → discovers raw narrative material), but the final return to her post resets the situation with no legible before/after in her stance or circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers imagery (coral shelves, palette, painted light, dream-boat) toward a final conceptual repricing where the library's shelves pulse with "coherent longing" and voices return. Closure occurs on the page with cost (palette cracks, colors rush back through veins), satisfying the DC/RR/CR requirement. However, orientation is delayed—who, where, and archipelago geography remain vague past the 120-word mark—and the causal linkage between photographing dawn and transferring the image to coral shelves reads more as lyric leap than motivated consequence, preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of starlight/locks/freeing), but the closure unit lacks visible cost. The protagonist walks to the mirror, cuts the air, the cub leaps into her mouth, and she speaks—a sequence of symbolic gestures without a legible before/after in options or knowledge. Orientation is delayed (who/where established, but "what she's doing" remains vague past the opening third), though the delay doesn't fully pay off at closure. The story teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final reconfiguration substitutes assertion ("I am no longer the locksmith of what frightens me") for dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara refuses the exchange, collects the tincture, and recovers memories, forecloses the path of forgetting with felt cost (abandoning safety). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (shipwrecks, upside-down trees, fairy ring, sextant) that converge at the scalpel beat. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Mara, decades later). One escalation tightening occurs when she lifts the sextant and memory surfaces, narrowing her choice to complete or refuse the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. The reversible-exile premise is established early, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child can return without forgetting because Lira "remembered for both"). Cost is asserted but remains conceptual; the on-page action (walking backward seven times, catching a page) does not dramatize a foreclosed path or visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a lyric-accumulative lens by midpoint and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Arin's realization that wonder must travel, not be hoarded, reconfigures his goal and forecloses the original plan. However, cost legibility is oblique—the loom collapses "its purpose fulfilled" without dramatized loss, and the shift from preservation to dispersal reads more as epiphany than a trade-off with on-page friction. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through density and pattern (knots → stories → singing masks) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence lifts and Elian understands his true calling. Orientation is clear early (Elian, prism sanctuary, starlight). The closure unit—last knot surrendered, fisherman freed, masks singing—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the accumulated silence that "lifted like fog"). One meaningful deepening occurs as each knot releases a story, narrowing toward resolution. The cost is felt but remains largely atmospheric rather than a hard trade-off that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered observations (torn map, footage comparison, fresco peeling, chapel opening) toward a conceptual repricing at closure where "the known world was the blank margin." The closure reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (choosing not to translate), though the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes the chapel opens to matched stillness, narrowing her interpretive options.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens—accumulative density building toward a conceptual repricing at closure—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the release ritual becomes completion rather than distress) with felt cost: Mara surfaces "irrevocably lighter," the transmission now "calm acknowledgement." Orientation anchors (Mara, sunken library, post-Earhart discovery) land cleanly within the first third. The escalation proceeds through recognition of buried cargo (1914) to the notebook's dissolution, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. The cost—letting the notebook dissolve unread, Elias forgetting, the ghost no longer a distress call—is legible on the page and charges the final image, meeting the closure gate under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is, where exactly this courtyard exists, and what "ghost in code" means remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure image (open mouth/listening ear glyph, child receiving message) gestures at Conceptual Repricing but the cost is asserted rather than shown—Lyra "shouldered the empty bolt plate, now light as a sigh" reads as relief, not sacrifice. Causality is thin: the echo's touch "completes circuits" and moths appear without prior setup, and the graffiti's transmission mechanism is never explained. Under an Accumulative lens (inferred from lyric density and pattern), the piece needed one decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead it drifts through metaphor without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of scattered artifacts (goggles, pages, cipher, map, seed) that accumulate and reconfigure meaning by the ending. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Lira, elevator, tenth floor, captain's death a week prior). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira plants the seed and remains below, forgoing ascent with visible cost—she trades her servant trajectory for rootedness. The cost is legible in "watering the future with melted ice" and "no longer ascending but expanding." One minor friction: the diary lock clicking open "as if the book itself had waited" introduces light convenience, though the prior accumulation of cipher-work earns much of the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. The piece accumulates memory, emotion, and scientific ritual toward a final image of self-sacrifice that completes the mother's theory. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (a form of Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Mara releases the kites, memorializes her mother's name, then steps out, accepting the cost of proof. Orientation is anchored early (gondola, telescope, altitude). The weaknesses: the cable-snap timeline ("after the string breaks" vs. "already snapped once") creates minor confusion about causality, and the final descent blurs whether she falls or floats purposefully—cost is felt but the mechanics waver.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (face-blind artist), where (tree-trunk library), and when (pre-demolition) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (coin indentations, fractal brushstrokes, guild history) and the closure reconfigures the premise—her limitation becomes the means of preservation—with conceptual cost (she walks out carrying nothing, the sky remains unseen by her). One meaningful tightening occurs when the first explosion forces her to work faster, narrowing options. The closure image (painted sky glowing as she leaves) offers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, though the cost is more conceptual (accepting unknowing) than visceral sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (airship, chart-room, Lira). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spirals, translations, and starling murmurations accrete toward a final image where light and story merge. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's spoken dialects restore the ship's luminance and dissolve sociable isolation—but the cost is unclear. What does Lira forfeit or foreclose by giving the ship "a story"? The captain's acknowledgment and the new map line are gains, not prices. The chief engineer's late-breaking rule ("light-feed runs on stories, not coal") introduces a mechanism that was not seeded earlier, weakening causal ground. One meaningful tightening occurs (lamps dim → Lira acts), but the resolution feels given rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increases until the hall-of-mirrors realization reweights the dominant stake). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the transition from corridor to workshop is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rowan realizes the mirrors store "better versions," enabling the key repair and door unlock—this narrows options and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the workshop scene crystallizes his acceptance and new role). The closure lands with conceptual cost (the doorway vanishes, sealing his transition from apprentice to custodian). Minor causal slip: the mentor's "disastrous dawn" and the sheared key are told in backstory without prior setup, so the healing feels less earned than designed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through recurring imagery (frost messages, watering bell, butterfly dust) and a cadence shift at closure when Mara dissolves into the nebula. Orientation anchors (Orchard Planet, twin suns, floating arches, Mara's ghost state) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mara's release into the nebula after orchestrating the harvest), and the cost is legible: her tether loosens, she becomes "the violet itself," a shift from individual agency to collective reserve. One minor slip: the timeline from "three seasons ago" to "years later" compresses without clear markers, but the accumulative pattern holds and the final image reweights her death as "shared life."

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors—adjuster, lighthouse, dusk, pane of hush—land early and hold. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through nested lullaby iterations, each recursion making the pane "more transparent" and pulling midnight's hand backward. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she becomes the pane's backing, voice "eternally whispering," a cost that is undeniable on the page. One tightening suffices at this length, and the cost is felt. Minor deduction: the nested-lifetimes frame and the mechanism by which the lullaby stops the clock remain more asserted than causally dramatized beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through the ticking frost-clock and Mara's sequential warm-ghost trail, resolving in Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she saves strangers but returns to her prison). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the cycle will repeat tomorrow). Orientation is clear early (cliffside, labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost deadline). One meaningful tightening occurs when the travelers hesitate at the final fork and Mara uses the nut-kernel handprint. The lens holds; cost is legible in the final walk back and the line "the same graceless beauty of saving strangers she would never meet again."

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara releases the sculptures, transforming private grief into public instrument, and walks away with "pockets empty," forecloing ownership with felt cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through braided images (river, chrysalis, polymer lattice, laughter) that converge in the ravine installation. Orientation anchors early (chemist, ravine, sister's death). One meaningful deepening occurs when insight surfaces ("the chrysalis was not empty; it was a mold"), narrowing her path from scattering ashes to casting presence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vendor's transactions layer meaning through recurring motifs (bottles, moonlight, parole words, negative space) until the final image where she becomes the door and the bottle shatters into rearranged letters. Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "when" (opening day lull) is more atmospheric than time-pressured. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the vendor realizes she is protagonist only by subtracting herself, enabling readers to step through her outline—but the cost remains implied and conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the librarian staggers with new memory and the building tilts, yet the causality between transactions and the vendor's final transformation feels elided rather than linked by because/therefore steps.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered sensory memory, density increase in the pavilion, and a cadence shift when Marisol pours her own memories into the coral. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (her gift transforms from absorbing to releasing) with felt cost—she gives away "every meal she'd ever cooked, every moment of joy"—and the final image reweights the opening's "sandpaper rough memories" into "polished by the slow friction of time." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening (the gift's reversal) is sufficient for this length, though the cost could be more viscerally on the page rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through language-braiding and the final image reweights the connection between tower and elevator. Orientation is delayed—spatial anchors (who, where, when) are not legible until ~150 words in, and the causal chain between actions remains vague (−0.4 under Orientation Test). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bridge metaphor charges the final image and the "roadway of resonance" shifts the initial problem from mechanical silence to shared resonance. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—Mireya's exhaustion and "metallic dust" are told, not shown as a meaningful forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates densely layered images and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara removes the helmet, finds sketches she didn't draw, and commits to return—a crystallized stance with felt cost (failed extraction, bloodied, burned-out mirror). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (canyon, moonlight, engineer). One meaningful deepening occurs when the moon shifts angle and engines collapse, forcing her back into singular flesh. Minor causality question: the sketches in her pockets feel retroactively convenient rather than earned by prior perception beats, softening the closure's logical grip.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening and follows a clear causal-situational hybrid: gravity inversion creates a ticking clock, the doodle guides navigation, and Ilyra's actions (speaking combinations, pressing the doodle into the void) trigger the light surge that restores the Archive's memory. The closure—combinations rescued and returned to the Archive—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the grotto seals, seeds return to dream, the doodle is spent). One meaningful tightening occurs when the seeds stir and threaten to incinerate her, forcing vocal modulation. The lens holds through the ending, though the felt personal cost to Ilyra remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through mapped cracks, strumming progression, and grove's answering resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the insulator glows and the world becomes "conversation." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words. The closure reweights the premise with felt cost (trembling knees, spell that mustn't break), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening—from mapping to sound to grove-wide symphony—is sufficient for this length, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece oscillates between accumulative/textural (magnetic hum patterns, twilight imagery) and causal (exile → nexus → resolution to teach) without teaching a clear pattern by midpoint. Closure is asserted ("he would teach the world") but occurs off-page with no visible cost or decision that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when clarify only gradually across the first third. The ending offers conceptual repricing in theme but no legible change in the tutor's options or situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered silence frequencies, each dial turn deepening the catalogue until the brass clasp's reweighting as "tuning fork shaped like a question" delivers Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors cleanly (workshop, Mirelle, pre-fireworks). The closure unit lands with felt cost: leaving the clasp "unlocked, broadcasting its quiet frequency" forecloses her sister's original intent to lock secrets away. One meaningful deepening (four silences culminating in "Silence That Lets the World Speak Without Killing") satisfies length requirements. Causality is somewhat diffuse—each frequency appears more through poetic assertion than because/therefore linkage—but under Accumulative lens this is permissible if the final cadence shift reweights the stake, which it does.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors land clearly by the second paragraph (Myrrh on rope bridge, corpse flower seed, treetop village). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: serenity shifts from goal to companion, the notebook is offered to wind-spirits, and descent toward the tide reweights prior material with felt cost (leaving the journal, releasing the chase). The cadence shift and lyric reprise charge the final image. One meaningful deepening—graft succeeds early, astonishment reversed—tightens pressure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: orchard pilot, skiff, twin suns, inversion hour. The piece follows a single continuous ascent structured around the inversion event, and closure lands on-page when Aera pulls the arrow free and descends with new understanding—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with thematic repricing). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered echoes, the sapling sequence, and the final image of synchronized blossoms. Cost is somewhat abstract ("her own memories drawn outward") but the final image of recognition and the arrow fusion suggests a durable shift. One meaningful deepening is present; the piece does not require multiple reversals under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph (Mara Quell, port, post-silence), satisfying orientation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: vectors converge, patterns intensify, the plaza reveals a charged center, and the final image (walking backward, printing reverse silhouettes) reweights Mara's surveying into prophetic calibration. However, the closure—writing backward, patch dissolving, spiral emerging—feels more asserted than causally earned; the reader receives the transformation via description ("containers shifted, corridors realigning") rather than witnessing a decisive on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The conceptual repricing is present (survey as rehearsal of future fractures), but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors Elian and the ice cavern promptly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through synesthetic color-beats and the aurora passage, culminating in the sheet ingestion. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights wonder from outlawed abstraction to embodied proof—but the cost is asserted ("dissolved into warm cider harmony") rather than felt as forfeiture or friction. The causal chain (bell ring → amber softens → sheet becomes drinkable) is efficient but convenience-smooth, offering no failed attempt or trade-off that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kaelen descends, arranges markers, listens, and the spiral completes a pattern of witnessing and release. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): she relinquishes the flute with the understanding that "driven is only half of keeper; the other half is stillness." The cost—giving up the object she guarded—is legible in the final image. Orientation is slightly delayed (location, time anchor by ~150 words), but the disorientation is functional and charges the canyon's otherworldly quality. One meaningful deepening (from failure-as-shame to failure-as-teacher) reweights the premise without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (topaz workshop, starlight, letterpress operator). Closure reads as a Decisive Change—Quince prints himself back, releasing borrowed souls—but the cost is abstract: his heart becomes "blank as unprinted paper" without showing what he's lost in lived terms. The drive lens wavers between Causal (personalities → halo fragment → child of light → reversal) and Accumulative/Textural (layered metaphors), settling into Hybrid by the end. Causality holds through most beats, but the halo fragment's mechanics arrive unexpectedly and resolve the problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (aurora, pendant vibration, recurring "fade" and "germinate" motifs) and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Elias becomes myth. However, the cost remains abstract—villagers "speak of" the transformation in summary, and no on-page action shows what he surrenders or loses. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by line three). The closure unit exists but the felt price is elided, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the prism ritual accumulates pressure through layered lies and sensory intensification until the truthful admission cracks the "shifted hush" and opens a path. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the fracture knits, grief is repositioned, prism left on dashboard)—cost is felt as relinquishment. Orientation anchors early (quartz arbor, sister's car). One friction: the causal link between the lies and the environmental responses (mist freezing, hush cracking) reads more as metaphor than motivated world-rule, creating mild lens drift between lyric accumulation and implied magical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she trades voice for message-delivery and continues weaving in silence; the cost is unmistakable ("swallowed name," "without sound") and the orchard's temporal reversal ("trees grew younger") reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: puzzle assembly dims the orchard, final bead placement opens the portal, voice becomes thread, silence seals. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds. The closure lands on the page with felt cost and coherent accumulative pressure, but the middle stretch (puzzle assembly) could tighten—several beats describe rather than shift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, waive penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure form: the arches descending and Thistle returning to forge new objects reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant). However, the cost is abstract—"bartered awakenings," "space between understanding and confusion"—and never lands as a legible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The silk's mechanics (how it lowers arches, why it works in mine shafts) remain opaque, weakening causal motivation. One meaningful deepening occurs (ladder touches arch, arches descend), but the stakes remain metaphorical throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (parallel bays, strand-weaving imagery) and uses density accumulation to reweight the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map-maker discovers her maps funded the cover-up, reweighting her craft with undeniable conceptual cost ("to chart not places but consequences"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (cracked deck, spaceport, sensory map maker). One deduction: the causal link between selling maps and funding the cover-up feels abrupt and under-supported; the complicity reveal would benefit from one additional earlier cue.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias rows backward keeping the tower in sight, the stones and bottled glass holding "a memory of radiance, fragile but sufficient," and the sea glass warmth travels "through his glove to the bone." The final image reweights prior material—the anonymous letter chain persists, the lamp remains dark, yet the exchange continues with undeniable cost (his vigilance, the widow's cove stone, the ache he carries). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered objects (stones, sea glass, chalk mark, cairns) and the cadence shift at closure—from ascent and ritual to the backward row and the green warmth—reweights the dominant stake (witnessing absence, keeping the chain unbroken) with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 (Elias, cliff base, "tonight"). One substantive deepening occurs when he builds the second cairn and wraps the sea glass, actions that narrow his emotional options and commit him to continued witness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: "Lirael, the laughing storm herald" and "emerald lighthouse" anchor character and place within the opening lines; waive penalty. Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image (emerald light, black flame, reversed text, dark sail) and cadence shift rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure form: the lighthouse "dissolved, leaving Lirael barefoot on dew" and "she heard distant presses starting up…of light, printing dawn directly onto the retina of the planet" reads as Conceptual Repricing—the premise (print is dead, beacon dark) is reweighted into a new mode of dawn-making. Cost is conceptual but legible: the lighthouse and old routine vanish, replaced by "portable lighthouse" internalized. However, the middle sequence (sail, navigation, auroras) loops through metaphor without a clear tightening that narrows Lirael's options; the lens holds but escalation within it remains diffuse until the final dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: memories and images pile up toward a thematic revelation. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final understanding that some become "invisible within" stories rather than collectors—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture, no visible before/after in her tactics or world state. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by ~100 words), but the ending reconfigures meaning without demonstrating what Hoshiko has paid or lost, reducing closure to a delivered insight rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (dreams as mercury beads, numbered trees, moonlight healing) that converge at closure when the sextant becomes a cedar. The closure unit qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transformation from instrument to tree reweights the "quantified sorrow" premise with visible cost (the astronomer's tool is irrevocably lost, replaced by living witness). The pin-drop timeframe is seeded early and echoed at closure, though its causal function remains oblique. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchor within the first two paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (memory keeper), where (alchemical orchard greenhouse), and the stakes (rekindle dying realm) clearly within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered metaphor (mica window expands, silhouettes solidify, songs weave light) and the closure reconfigures the mirror-world premise when "every mirror refused to reflect another's light" becomes collaborative song. However, the causal chain from her solo lullaby to collective chorus to dawn-weaving feels compressed—silhouettes appear and align without clear agency or cost in that transition, weakening the escalation into closure. The ending image (new trees, restored chorus) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("memories knit together, yet she let them keep her name") rather than dramatized as a legible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's reflection and the library's atmosphere building toward the final disappearance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure—Elara dissolving into the library's tranquility—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (a form of Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. The causal chain from mis-delivery to massacre to disappearance is summarized backstory, not on-page pressure, which limits escalation legibility even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bread-planting sequence builds density through repeated ritual acts, and the closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of Mila as gardener with "soil under nails now hers." However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single choice visibly forecloses a path or alters tactics. The Orientation Test is satisfied (Mila, Rue des Aubes, post-migration season anchored early). The middle deepening (guerrilla gardening across seven sites) adds texture but does not narrow options or create a live trade-off. The ending reconfigures Mila's identity but lacks the felt price required for high-band closure under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural under a lyric lens: vows flicker and dissolve in sequence, building density through spectral layering and measurement beats. The closure image—data warming into sap, "sweet and meaningless"—offers Conceptual Repricing by reweighting preservation into futility, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening occurs when the lantern fuel dwindles and she quickens her work, narrowing time, yet no causal because/therefore linkage forces a trade-off or alters her options—she completes every measurement and retains the tablet, so escalation lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through density increase (waiting hours, rehearsing betrayals, tide rising) and cadence shift at dawn ("a breath away"). Orientation anchors (pier market, narrator with fob, Jonah with phonograph) land clearly by line 7. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator forfeits the fob and the father-bond with it, foreclosing rescue and accepting the "silence no one could sell back." Cost is visible in the "small wet click" and the walk through daylight with gulls "screaming news of my betrayal." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the ending reweights trust as a burden she chose to shed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land early, satisfying that test. However, the closure relies on summary transformation ("feeling the compass ring cool...knowing that tomorrow she would wake") rather than a decisive on-page change with legible cost. The story shifts from seeking understanding to "becoming" a weather-bearer, but this shift is told through exposition in the final paragraphs rather than enacted. Under a Causal lens, the link between the woman's presence and the protagonist's acceptance lacks because/therefore pressure—the skeptic simply "melts" without visible forfeiture of her former stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (crystal, lock, laughter, portrait) toward a final reconfiguration where the artist shifts from solitary memory work to communal creativity. Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's underground emerge gradually across the first third, creating mild fog. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (she stops selling portraits of the past and invites strangers to draw their own dawns), but the cost is more implied than dramatized: we're told her fingers are "finally clean" and she carries "no sketches," yet the renunciation lacks a specific on-page moment of visible loss or friction. The lock's mechanical transformation (numbers shifting, releasing laughter) leans toward magic realism without establishing the rule early, creating a minor causality wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through map assembly, cathedral discovery, and culminates in shared truth-telling that lifts vines and reweights the city's false-breath economy. Orientation is clear by the greenhouse studio. The closure—staying until dawn to finish lost correspondence—reconfigures her role from solitary illuminator to honesty postmaster, a Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is present but diffuse: she risks curfew, confronts loneliness, yet no single path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The montage of opening letters and the dawn exit feel more like thematic summary than a tightening choice, weakening the felt stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the comet's arrival provides the occasion, and the sculpture's activation reweights the tuner's lifelong preparation into a moment of resonance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—crystallizes the tuner's thirty-year mission in the final image of her walking wordless into the valley, trusting the instrument to the wind; however, the cost remains conceptual (leaving the work behind) rather than felt on the page with visible sacrifice or foreclosed options during the calibration itself.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: android caretaker, glass-domed rose farm, magnetic shift imminent. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (roses igniting, box merging, miniaturization) that converge in the final compressed flower containing all memory. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the android plants itself, the farm compresses, and the final image of the impossible flower reweights the premise with conceptual cost (centuries of waiting, transformed by fire). One meaningful deepening occurs when K-17 opens the box and allows fears to become seeds. Cost is legible in the android's choice to root itself and accept transformation rather than preserve sterile order, though the mechanics of "miniaturization" and "controlled burn escape" blur at the ending, reducing causal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered testimony and sensory witnessing rather than causal because/therefore chains. Orientation is anchored early (courtyard, thrift shop, dawn), waiving the test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (neighbors gather in shared silence; the mailbox quiets), but on-page cost is elusive: Mira's final smile and certainty feel asserted rather than paid for, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The story deepens atmosphere and reweights the stake from mystery-solving to communal witnessing, yet the final image ("the key we already are") substitutes metaphor for dramatized consequence. One meaningful tightening (dawn vigil → collective listening) is present, satisfying length expectations, but cost remains conceptual and oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (sunken lab), and the timeframe (spider's web) by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat—dice roll, current surrender, archive discovery, page-swallowing—densifies the encryption motif and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing when Mara surfaces and the code spreads as song, reweighting vulnerability → strength with conceptual cost (she carries it bodily, no regime can confiscate). One minor causality slip: the emergency buoy trigger and lab's air release feel convenient rather than motivated by prior choice. The closure lands on the page with felt cost (ingestion, bodily risk) and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale's gravity, the salt chamber, and the memory-recovery ritual build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the dispersal of memories into the city). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—Miren releases her sister's memories to strangers, accepting distribution over possession. Orientation anchors early (dock, dawn, whale carcass, Miren's role). The tightening is the ritual sequence itself, which narrows from search to recovery to release; one meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the summoner maps silence, cranes multiply, and the sphere is swallowed, culminating in a world freed of encoded prophecy. Orientation is delayed—"who" anchors by line 6, "where" (brook) immediately, but "what is at stake" clarifies only around the prophecy mention (line 5). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the summoner accepts the weight, villages wake free), but the cost is more asserted than dramatized: we are told he carries the sphere and walks on, yet no concrete price—lost ability, physical toll, or foreclosed path—is shown on the page. The causal link between swallowing the sphere and the prophecy's defeat is metaphorically rich but mechanically vague.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece teaches its pattern early (meteor shower as metaphor, agreed-upon lies as motif) and the final beat reweights "stay" and the cycle of teaching/becoming. Orientation is delayed but deliberate: who/where/when coalesce by the gargoyle interaction (~25%), and the effect charges the ending. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator inherits the seal and the building acknowledges the shift. Cost is conceptual and relational (becoming the new keeper, extending the lie to Mrs. Chen), legible in the final image of the word "stay" on the window.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: garden details, the shell's whispers, and memory fragments build density toward the closure where Mara's memory becomes a public archive. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The escalation from private retrieval to public dissemination constitutes a meaningful tightening, and the cost (color vision traded for memory liberation) lands on the page. However, the mechanics of how the shell "re-authorizes" memory and how the garden "prints" it into roots remain abstract at the critical beat, slightly weakening causal legibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pearl twilight motif, sanctuary setting, blood writing) but closure arrives as a declared epiphany ("I forgive the unfinished") rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The orientation test fails: who Mara is, why she's here tonight, and what immediate stakes exist remain unclear past the 120-word mark. The ending summarizes her transformation in abstract terms without an on-page decisive change or charged final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—motifs (echo, shell, song, moths) layer toward a final reweighting. The nexus descent functions as a single continuous pressure window with clear spatial progression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira completes her mother's unfinished departure, dissolving the cocoon and hearing no rebound—a legible before/after with conceptual cost (she must leave echo behind to avoid looping). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, cost at closure feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the "finished sentence carried by wind" image is resonant but lacks the sharp sting of visible sacrifice or forfeited option that would lift this into higher bands. One meaningful deepening (discovering her mother's voice, realizing unfinished departures loop) narrows understanding, satisfying the lens, but escalation remains gentle rather than tightening with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation debt is severe: by 120 words we have a dream within a dive, melted snow globe appearing from nowhere, and no clear anchor for who/where/when in the waking frame. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—accumulative texture competes with causal quest logic, neither fully cohering. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge that wreckage cradles light) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the globe's "pure thing" and her teaching future-self are tell-only abstractions. The midpoint shrine sequence introduces new mechanics (candles, air-corridor) without earned setup, and the ending conflates multiple closure gestures (mirror, future vision, meltwater footprints) that dilute rather than sharpen the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. The piece builds density through firefly imagery, moon paths, and the whisk motif, achieving a cadence shift at the discovery. However, closure validity is weakened: the protagonist finds the whisk and descends to mend nets, but no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered, and the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The ending reweights the premise thematically (hidden effort as moon paths) but lacks the on-page pressure that would distinguish Resonant Reconfiguration from mere thematic echo. Orientation is clean; one transition (parapet to harbor) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through the letter-reassembly sequence, and the final image of broadcast lies and browning apples reweights the opening premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by the second paragraph). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the diamond becomes a broadcast mechanism rather than a personal burden, shifting the orchard from preserved lie to accelerating rot. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marisol chooses to hang the diamond rather than carry it. The cost is conceptual and ecological rather than visceral, which fits the accumulative design but limits emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through layered imagery (static, cobalt glass, frequencies) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration in the form of Charged Poise—Elara's final choice crystallizes her transformation into "the shadow that would teach others to seek their own light." Cost is legible in the line "her form dissolving into the transmission," though the conceptual price (becoming the ghost in every machine) carries more weight than the emotional. The closure reweights prior material, but the causal linkage between hitting the key and theportico walk feels slightly elided; the two acts blur without a clear because/therefore hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: jars accumulate, density builds, and the music box's opening constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where options crystallize and meaning reweights prior material. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The cost is conceptual and felt—Posy's years of solitary work converge in one act of faith—but the child's convenient arrival and the holographic projection veer toward symbolic convenience rather than dramatized consequence, slightly weakening closure credibility under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse engineer, pier, sunset, artifact crisis). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural, shifting to Causal at the climax when Mireya changes the bowing pattern to create a "third path." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (teaching darkness to listen rather than destroy) with visible cost: the key's teeth are worn smooth, her promise binds her to ongoing vigilance. One meaningful tightening occurs when ice begins to calve, forcing the pivot. Minor causality slip: shadows "tasting sound" and then being invited "to listen instead of consume" blurs whether they were already listening or needed invitation, softening the turn's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through moon-path observations and magnetic pulses until the spiral tightens to a keystone moment; closure lands as Charged Poise when Elian presses the compass and the lantern signal blinks—options crystallize, the revolution begins, impatience cools. Cost is legible: he leaves the compass as offering, his role complete. Orientation anchors (sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct) arrive early. One small friction: the mechanics of how his mapping triggers the village signal remain slightly abstract, but the causal accumulation through observation→pattern→timing→signal holds under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly and maintains a causal chain: Mara investigates suicides → finds journal → understands complicity → resolves to expose truth. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) but the cost remains abstract—"each step a small rebellion" asserts weight without showing what she forecloses or risks by speaking out. The drought-as-weapon backstory and the commissioner's legacy provide context but the final image (lantern guiding memories) substitutes metaphor for on-page consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers Park's journal and recognizes her father's pattern, but the ending tells rather than demonstrates the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: Emil walks toward the penitentiary having "turned apology into motion, gear by gear," now positioned beside both gurney and truth. The orientation is clean (shop, storm, dawn execution hour) and the causal chain holds—repair enables music, evidence delivery enables investigation, both choices reweight his chaplain role. One meaningful deepening occurs when Emil produces Rowan's scrawl, transforming the repair errand into a justice mission. Cost is legible in the candle fund, his unchanged witness duty, and the "imperfect, courageous beat" that acknowledges limits, though the final image's conceptual repricing could feel more viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: months of chasing evolving coordinates, kaleidoscope permutations, and the Yearning Algorithm's pulse build toward the bell-striking closure. The final image—acid sea as mirror, bell's vibration "sung in a chord," future receivers tuned to the frequency—reconfigures the quest with felt cost (arrow tip "dulled but satisfied," gears slowing, task complete). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Arlo, workshop, acid sea, Juniper at navigation desk). One meaningful deepening occurs when the kaleidoscope jams and the Algorithm commands "Descend," narrowing Juniper's options and forcing the climb. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the bell's ringing is revealed as translation, not mechanical clapper-strike, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (generational receivers, algorithm reset). Cost is legible in the dulled arrow tip, completed gears, and Juniper's whispered contract with evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the keeper becomes the broadcast archive, reweighting "deletion" as distributed memory. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (corporate role, archive, hashtag emergence). The causality chain from hashtag auto-complete → patch speaker → coordinates → server farm holds, though several moves (security lie, crystal bargain, hashtag trending worldwide) rely on convenience rather than protagonist tactics. The closure image—blank user posting every 73 hours, Block 73 singing back—lands with conceptual cost (her erasure from payroll, mother's voice distributed) but the immediate trigger (touching crystal, singing aloud) feels more like activating a preset mechanism than a decision that narrows prior options.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a hybrid lens—causal mechanics (mirror-entry, fragment reconstitution) nested in an accumulative/textural frame (empathy mapping). Orientation anchors arrive clearly: Mara, orchard, mirrors, shard. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (reflection trapped as collateral, empathy dripped into future dreams), and the final image ("voice steady, heart unhidden") reweights the detachment premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara swallows her bottled empathy and confronts the Keeper. Minor causality wobble: the revocation phrase and harbor-market mechanics arrive late without prior setup, relying on exposition ("taught only in nightmares") rather than earlier cues.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with mosaic structure (multiple time-shards: night one, day three, boarding scene, years later, old age). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the parasol-as-compass image and the cycle restarting, but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page—no specific forfeiture or tactical narrowing is visible in the final beat. Orientation anchors slip: "the morning after waking up changed" never clarifies what changed or when, and the mercy ship's function oscillates between witnessing platform and active departure vessel without clear setup. One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy runs toward the horn, but the resolution (planting the parasol, years passing) tells rather than shows the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Marco, vineyard, post-bus dusk). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and metaphoric recurrence build toward a final image where Marco decides to act. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the protagonist crystallizes a stance ("We are still possible") with conceptual cost (risking renewed rejection after nineteen years)—but the cost remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening (rediscovery of letter → decision to regraft and reconnect) suffices for this length, though the causal chain leans heavily on reflective bridging rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the walker performs a ritual whose steps accumulate density toward a preservation outcome. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the walker completes his task and departs, having preserved the echo. However, the cost remains abstract; no on-page line shows what the walker gave up or what path was foreclosed by this act. The "echo stabilize[d]" moment asserts success without dramatizing friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a lyric spiral structure that builds toward the dove image as Conceptual Repricing. The closure reweights the premise (pain as beauty) through the children's recognition, but the cost remains abstract—"gratitude" without visible forfeiture or altered tactics. The archivist's action does not foreclose a path; she simply completes her ritual and leaves. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the workers arrive, but the closure lacks felt pressure or visible consequence scaled to the piece's length.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: sequences accumulate through the crystal, density increases with remembered voices, and the final image (crystal humming, last word "zygote") attempts a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchors (Elara, library, dawn, day after last dictionary) arrive early. However, the closure unit lacks legible cost: Elara leaves, others will continue—what has she lost or gained? The "pattern of growth" remains abstract, and the decisive change is asserted ("she had spoken for the silence") rather than felt on the page. Cost proof test fails; no sentence shows a visible price paid or path foreclosed at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: the prophet's search through arranged driftwood markers leads to the cassette tape discovery, which provides the sound he seeks and triggers the final realization. Orientation anchors (junkyard prophet, fog sculpture garden, dawn) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist understands he isn't just searching for the sound but becoming it, with the conceptual cost made explicit in "one forgotten tomorrow at a time." The escalation functions through accumulation of sensory density and the cassette tape's revelation rather than causal pressure, which fits the chosen lens and provides one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the story accumulates metaphorical density toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first third. The closure—Mira boarding the shuttle as the observatory collapses into the photograph—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains largely conceptual and felt rather than materially legible on the page. The linkage between the spinning clock hand, the photograph, and the station's collapse is more symbolic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's realization on the skybridge—"reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward"—reweights the vinyl motif and forecloses the fantasy of seamless restoration, with conceptual cost legible in the jagged line she accepts. Orientation is swift (hospice ward, Tuesday bloodwork, Room 914 by paragraph three). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through hymning layered sounds, then deepens via the vinyl fragment's journey from bedside to Mara's chest, culminating in the skybridge epiphany. One tightening (Calderon's death) and one deepening (Mara's self-application of the ritual) fit the 600–800 scope.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure unit—shadows rushing back and Lyra's trade—lands on the page with cost, and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through its layered imagery and spiraling structure. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening's world-rule exposition, but the mosaic pattern excuses some drift. The causal chain is present but diffuse: the automaton's activation triggers the resolution, yet Lyra's agency in "closing loops" reads more metaphorical than mechanically clear, softening the escalation. The cost—her wandering silhouette exchanged—is stated but not felt in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric structure; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara places the tooth into the constellation's jaw and the garden rewrites itself, reweighting her stance on mistakes. Orientation anchors (Elara, secret garden, morning after) arrive early. The cost—accepting fractures as permanent guides rather than erasable errors—is conceptual and felt in the final image of "heart a map of bright fractures." One meaningful deepening occurs when the changeling offers the map and Elara shifts from yearning to rewind to accepting the wounding angle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward the pearl's emergence and dissolution, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the pearl dissolves, stillness remains inside Lira, villagers feel unafraid). Closure lands on the page with felt cost—the pearl's absence registers as fullness, a paradox that reweights the opening loneliness. Causality is loose but patterned; the gem-polishing ritual enables the pearl's appearance, and Lira's choice to release it into the village completes the arc. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard strikes and the pearl condenses, narrowing her options to acceptance and dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by paragraph three (late but functional). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the burial and amber-shadow image crystallize the stakes of small survival after viral exposure, and the cost—leaving separately, no names exchanged—is felt. The lens holds through layered imagery and cadence shifts, though causality between beats relies more on thematic accumulation than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered encounters and recursive motifs until the final writing act reweights the premise. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the act of finishing the novel, the shell as lighthouse, and Lira's resolution create a before/after with conceptual cost (no more evasion). Orientation is taught early (nexus, three channels, mist, mother's shell). One micro-penalty: the nexus's mechanics (fog-to-solid transformation) are asserted more than dramatized, and the middle transitions feel slightly compressed without full causal handoff between encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening, satisfying the test. The piece follows a single continuous ritual action from dawn to completion—a valid causal track—but the escalation reads as ceremonial inevitability rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The ending disperses the remedy and voices rise in song, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (restoration of ancestral knowledge), but the cost is asserted in summary ("what was never truly lost") rather than felt on the page. The inferred lens is Causal with ceremonial overtones; closure lands but without sharp before/after tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through lyric recurrence and image layering toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure: the alchemist chooses to remain, "conductor of silence," and the orchard becomes "a living score"; his refusal to leave forecloses the path to reunion with visible cost (he will never find her). Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is clear by line one, but "where" (subarctic crater, withered orchard) and "when" (tonight, under auroras) coalesce only across the opening paragraph—acceptable under lyric allowance, no penalty applied. The tightening is modest: he finds the plate, seals it to the vial, and the orchard "exhales"; the route "draws itself" but he sits rather than follows, crystallizing his stance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scarecrow's chest begins to beat and he maps the rhythm, then chooses guardianship over departure—sufficient under Accumulative lens, though the causal linkage between sealing and staying is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Ansel's incremental study of reflections, percussion craters, and delays builds density toward the reversal of the timer and the return of lost hours. Orientation anchors appear promptly (marble cavern, locksmith, broken timer). Closure lands on the page—sealing the timer, releasing hours, locking wonder away—with felt cost (the key he will never duplicate, hours returning as translucent moths that dissolve). One pressure point tightens when he feeds silence backward, triggering the boy-image and the release. The lens holds without contradiction, but causality between studying angles and reversing the mechanism is implied rather than shown step-by-step, keeping this out of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the weaver gathers burdens, weaves them, and must add her own to complete the lattice. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words. The closure—her confession calcifying, the grotto unfolding, her departure carrying "only the memory of their weight"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid) with visible cost: she surrenders her heaviest burden and leaves the lamp behind. One deduction: the grotto's mechanics (sevenfold symmetry, flame-kissing-tile protocol) feel more incanted than causally motivated, and the final unfolding hinges on the confession's weight rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns grief through carving and accumulates meaning via recurring images (sawdust, rust, cage latch, the phrase "here and gone"), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara hangs the latch and accepts memory as "both cage and key." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure reweights prior material with felt cost—she chooses to carve the lion's face next, eyes open—but the tightening is more cadence shift than causal narrowing, and the conceptual cost (accepting Emil's death as permanent) is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final paragraph rather than crystallized in one image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through dense imagery and fragments. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration ("shared erosion") with conceptual cost legible in the dissolving images and the ghost's permanence on the bench. However, the midpoint causality is elided—why breaking the wheel and reading fragments aloud produces "fracture so still that even silence holds its breath" is asserted rather than motivated. The orientation anchors (kinetic lagoon, obsidian mare, 03:17) land clearly by ~120 words. Cost is visible (images dissolve, ghost remains), but the protagonist's path from mounting the mare to breaking the wheel lacks a because/therefore hinge that would lift this higher under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through density of image and motif (sextant, glycol, brass birds) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the terminal acquires a heartbeat and Alya pockets the sextant as proof. Cost is conceptual—she leaves the space transformed but herself unchanged in a legible way—yet the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (abandoned terminal, Alya, brass shard). One meaningful cadence shift when the birds stir suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density around the clock, forecourt, and petrichor through recurrence and intensification, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Arlen leaves the clock and "inherited stillness." The cost is legible—he forecloses ambition and accepts emptiness—and the final image of the corroded gears fused to crystal reweights prior material. Orientation is clear early. Minor weakness: the middle section layers reflection heavily without crisp micro-choices that alter present tactics, slightly flattening the tightening expected even in accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens—Mara decodes logbooks, finds coordinates, locates the bunker, reads journals—and holds it through closure. Orientation is prompt: canal, twilight, barge established early. The ending shift (sundial into crate, turning toward other cities) reads as Charged Poise with felt cost: relinquishing the heirloom and accepting a long dismantling mission. One objection: the journals appear conveniently intact and fully confess exactly what the plot needs, reducing friction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (fulgurite beads accumulate meaning; final seed-planting and shoot reweight the preservation stake). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ari escapes with the complete catalog, plants one seed in defiance, and the green shoot threads salt-soaked wood where maps claim nothing can grow—a felt cost (public defiance, lost secrecy) charges the final image without needing the full harvest shown. Orientation anchors who/where/when quickly. The harbormaster's arrival tightens stakes once; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the planted seed and the dock's transformation, though the escape itself softens consequence slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a lyric/accumulative lens but struggles with causality: the weft thread's transformation from object to "extracted presence" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the clients' post-obituary fates (vanishing, appearing in the garden) lack on-page mechanism. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the planted thread and empty notebook, but the "geography of healing" remains abstract—what options have changed? The cost (seven years of work ending) is told but not felt in a specific forfeiture or trade-off at the moment of planting.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the prince's assembly process (moonlight distillation, feather retrieval, music-box necropolis descent) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the palace falls, beauty escapes, and the prince accepts the descent as "genesis." Orientation is swift (suspended palace, bedraggled prince, extinct egg by line three). The closure image (palace plunging, child hearing colored wind) reconfigures the mechanical world with conceptual cost (loss of the palace, beauty's refusal to stay), though the cost feels more lyric than visceral. One micro turn (crack in the egg, ribbon of wind) reweights the stakes cleanly, but the final hypothesis ("word count of his life would end…with a trembling reverie of song") edges toward thematic summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals its lens—Accumulative/Textural—early and holds it through closure: the graft ritual gathers symbolic density and culminates in a final salute that reweights prior material. Orientation is clear by line three (Mara, lagoon, annual ritual). However, the closure lands as a stated promise ("next year I would bring saplings") rather than an on-page decisive change or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The cost is asserted thematically but not felt in the final image; the piece stops at intention rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumbs → fountain stations → memory releases build density toward the final image of steam rising and geese resuming flight. Orientation anchors (city, box, geese, Mara) arrive early. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara leaves the box, memories dissipate, "silence of things finally let go." Cost is legible (she relinquishes the container, accepts the weight), and the lens holds. However, the four-fountain structure creates identical beats—arrive, box warms/vibrates, memory surfaces, she moves on—without meaningful tightening or a causal turn that narrows options until the very end, limiting escalation under even an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis): Kael seals his destined heart-crack by choosing transmission over rooted sorrow, leaving the gear as monument. The cost is legible—he walks on carrying "nothing except the echo," foreclosing inherited exile. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sonar pulses, petals, and gear fractures until the beacon encounter reweights all prior motifs. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by paragraph 1, no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—butterflies, poems, chrysalises layer toward a thematic repricing—but the closure effect is told rather than shown: "she understood," "emerged with new understanding," "transformed" are declarations without visible cost or a decisive final image. The spectral mentorship delivers all causal pressure via summary ("you carved these in your sleep") rather than dramatized choice, flattening the tightening into exposition. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat shows what the carver forfeits or how her options narrow on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a strong situational component at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the protagonist's identity, the tower setting, and the dawn ritual establish the frame immediately. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): the protagonist winds the spring to compensate, slowing time and reclaiming the field, and the final image—"for-give, for-give, a metronome teaching the sea to retreat one grain at a time"—reweights the premise with felt cost (corroding tower, protagonist's eventual burial beneath the field). One meaningful deepening occurs when the rake handle replaces the bob, altering the clock's function and the village's cadence. The cost is legible on the page: the tower's bones "blush with orange grief," the villagers walk slower, and the protagonist remains bound to the winding ritual until death.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates symbols and clues across beats, and the final descent offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, orientation debt is present: who Mercy is beyond "blithe gardener," where exactly we are in the cemetery, and what "after the chess clock runs down" means temporally remain unclear past 120 words. The closure reweights the opening images (spiral, tapestry, seeds) but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we are told she is "charged to let the dead speak" rather than shown a visible foreclosure. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and waive deeper penalty since the pattern does eventually cohere at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but "when" (the pre-dawn temporal frame) remains decorative rather than constraining. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but the final image—stepping off the spire and "becoming the blank page"—offers Conceptual Repricing without legible cost; the consequence is told ("leaving a tattoo," "a child would later find") rather than felt on the page. The cartographer's agency is passive surrender, not a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust, rosin, broadcasts, and notation accumulate until the solstice transmission triggers a chord that fills the hall and transforms the inspectors. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Ministry men "mouthing newly learned words," the city's mist carrying "fragments of chord") with conceptual cost (the famine of stories begins to reverse). The cost is legible but oblique—Mila's acceptance of capture is stated rather than dramatized as a trade-off she weighs. Causality within the accumulative design holds: each night's transcription builds toward the amplification, and the copper filament setup enables the climax. One micro-tension: the pirate broadcaster's role and fate remain vague, weakening the sense of coordinated risk.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of spiraling, fragmented memory early and maintains it through the installation's physical spiral and the grandmother's incomplete stories. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena at the spiral's center, scattering powder while understanding that "safety is always a mirage we create from incomplete information"—a crystallization that reconfigures her relationship to her grandmother's withheld truths. The cost is legible: she continues scattering "smaller spirals...each grain a moment her grandmother had held back, each spiral a confession that arrives too late to change anything except the shape of absence itself." The single-scene continuous window with one transition (evening lighting shift) fits scope. Minor orientation delay (gallery context established gradually) does not obscure comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sedimentary imagery, diving beats, and the counter-narrative project build density toward the final public utterance. Orientation anchors clearly (sewer conduit, post-plague New Venice) by the opening lines. The closure—Caldera's first public words and the crowd's recoil—delivers a Charged Poise moment where options crystallize (silence vs. public stance) with conceptual cost (social isolation, uncertain reception). One escalation tightens midway (finding the burial sump), but the connective tissue between beats often feels like accumulation of similar acts rather than a single meaningful narrowing of tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (velvet library, autumn equinox, Mara the former choir teacher). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through layered images—rosette, books exhaling scents, seventeen syllables, moonlight—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara's silence becomes the root tone of the city. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (she never sings aloud again, the rosette crumbles), and the lens holds. However, the causality between collecting syllables, singing the scale, and the city's transformation is elided rather than dramatized, relying on metaphor over motivated linkage, which prevents entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative pattern early (greenhouse as ruin → beauty, taste-memory linkage) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the greenhouse transforms and officers leave "disarmed, pockets mysteriously full of plum-colored seeds." The cost is conceptual (Ministry's control eroded) and the final image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed sprouts and releases aromas that infiltrate the city's sleep, altering the collective through synaptic plasticity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Mara, booth, tower, post-blackout) and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nectar-dusk imagery and wonder-versus-routine accumulate until the lightning strike reanimates the hive and Mara opens the gate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the matchbox offering and open gate crystallize a new stance with cost (waived toll, abandoned protocol). The riddle mechanism ("speak the lie you never told") provides a clear tightening, and the coins etched with bees offer conceptual repricing. One minor slip: the boy's disappearance and the queen's agency are coincidental prompts rather than Mara-driven escalation, slightly diluting protagonist control at the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers sensory data and displaced objects until the compass ritual reweights the bay's "alive-ness" into a legible grammar of absence. The closure—houses sighing in unison, curtains breathing, streetlights concluding—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world is restored to balance) with conceptual cost (some absences remain unfilled). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orris shard reveals the double-exposure interior, teaching the rule that drives the ending. Causality under the accumulative mode holds: collection → ritual → systemic sigh. The cost is felt in the decision to leave the compass needle-less, though the emotional or relational price to Elara herself remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early—awakening telepathy spreads through sensory accumulation—and maintains coherent escalation: statue wakes → reads garden's hidden life → approaches keystone → breaks ampoule → memory cascades → garden transforms. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator sits beneath the arch with telepathy humming, gate open, waiting for divers—options crystallized, cost visible (skin softened to "possibility," certainties dissolved). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ampoule's breaking forces acknowledgment of the court's hypocrisy. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (garden location, narrator's form, telepathic gift). The cascade mechanism is motivated and the final image reweights the opening's "hiding, holding its breath" into active welcome with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: perpetual motion → faltering → blood marks → negative steps → ripple → convulsion forms a coherent pressure arc. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara does *not* step through, sacrifices the dice, and the staircase "begins to forget her"—a renunciation with visible cost (dissolution, convulsion) on the page. Orientation anchors (Elara, staircase, dice) land cleanly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chipped die balances impossibly, triggering recognition and escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through imagery and the mural's expansion. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when coalesce only after the greenhouse is entered (~15% in). Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (the neighborhood exhales lost syllables, Mira sleeps) lands with thematic weight but minimal on-page cost; the ending summarizes outcomes (marigolds, smiles, sleep) rather than dramatizing a final choice or renunciation that forecloses a visible path. The waxing moon and saffron glow recur, but no persistent constraint tightens tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Aurelia's realization that "culture wasn't something you preserved behind glass, but something you broke and shared like bread" reconfigures her stance with visible cost (setting down her professional tool, learning unfamiliar work). Orientation anchors are present early (grotto city, museum guide, three seasons' wait). The cost is felt through forfeited professional distance and the fading emerald tint symbolizing stripped illusions. One weakness: the thaw arrives as external complication rather than through protagonist agency, though the true turn is Aurelia's internal shift before that event.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~200 words), triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece follows a Causal lens: yoyo mechanics → time fold → string cut → workshop return. Closure lands with cost (loss of counterclockwise gift), but the cost is told rather than felt through prior particulars. The reversal (escaping fate by trading his gift) is legible but not deeply rooted in earlier choices; the hunger stone and yoyo mechanics feel introduced to solve the problem they didn't help create.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: images and motifs (clasp, mirrors, luminance, photo booth) layer and shift meaning until the final act of giving the clasp to the child-self closes with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via forgiveness). Orientation anchors (funhouse, post-resuscitation, protagonist alone) arrive promptly. The escalation is one of symbolic density rather than causal pressure—each beat adds weight until the mirror collapses inward. Cost is felt (the advisor goes quiet, the clasp is surrendered) but implied more than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture. The lens holds and closure lands, though the final image's cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (orchard raft, prophet, blue hour) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates sonic/visual texture (resonance sketches, fractal echoes, cloud signatures) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the raft moves through sound, the obstacle becomes instrument, and the cost is the persistent work of layering and rigging under the Doldrum Wall's pressure. The escalation from passive recording to active dubbing to kinetic crown construction tightens options under the chosen lens. One minor ellipsis: the crown's assembly and immediate efficacy compress causality, but the pattern of sound-as-force has been taught throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: the cartographer's actions (altering the whistle note, repeating the pattern seven times) directly cause the turtles to change course and the watchers to respond. Orientation anchors promptly (cartographer, Chelon, dawn ritual, closed gate). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: she gains the answer (the gate protects children from choosing the horizon) and accepts the burden of charting toward rather than away from that knowledge; the whistle slipping is the physical marker of that cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watchers stir and the city veers northward, narrowing her options.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative layering (rosebush petals marking time). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara walks toward the city with the letter, cost implied in "ministers would curse her name" and the final image of dawn on rusted rails. Cost is conceptual and social rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping this shy of high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara descends, inserts notes into three locations (fissure, altar hollow, dome void), and ascends, with each insertion deepening the ritual's symbolic weight. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of future scholars "coring through repaired stone" reweights her surveyor role from diagnostic to memorial—and the cost is conceptual (her professional report now smuggles grief). Orientation anchors quickly (granite coping, drawbridge, lagoon). One meaningful tightening occurs at the dome's "circular void" where she writes directly on stone, and the walk inland without looking back closes the arc. The cost is felt but oblique; the report she owes the engineers is mentioned but never shown altering her tactics or creating friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, flooded library, blackout, indexing mission established within opening lines. Drive lens is Causal: blackout enables stamp use → glyph reveals city grid → Mara decides to rewrite index, each beat motivated by prior discovery. Closure is Decisive Change with cost: she rewrites the taxonomy to remember pre-submergence truth, accepts private burden of holding false history at bay, and surfaces with warm wrist mark as proof. One meaningful tightening when she extinguishes the lantern and reads by darkness. Cost is legible in her solitary burden and the Council's ongoing ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (the ritual forces stance crystallization). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the maker transforms private grief into communal lanterns and her hands shift from kerosene to tea, a sensory repricing with felt cost (the daughter's dream is consumed, cranes disperse). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The escalation operates through ritual beats (descent-ascent, breathing the dream, folding cranes) that deepen rather than reverse, fitting the lens. One minor causality slip: the moonstone "cracked along its equator" without prior setup, introducing a state change that feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with a Decisive Change: the protagonist's fall will redirect tomorrow's drone strike, and the final image of "unused potential pooling" reweights the hunt. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Causal final act), held coherently through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (observatory, survivor, geode). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes he's harvesting unlived lives, then accelerates the hunt, narrowing to the final perturbation calculus. Cost is visible: his death becomes the .003-degree telescope shift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Mara tracks the pilgrim → finds him at the observatory → he explains the chip → she pulls the press lever → the star-map reveals her parents' frequency → she departs to follow it. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs, satisfying the test. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Mara gains the map and her "frequency of belonging" with no dramatized trade-off, refusal, or foreclosed option on the page—"They're waiting" functions as a gift rather than a choice under pressure. The pilgrim's departure and Mara's smile read as soft resolution without consequence, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: Elias's discovery that his mother was the client creates the core reversal, and the driftwood carving of his honest face provides the pivot toward confession. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—two people "finally light enough to carry the weight of what had always been unsaid"—with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt terrace, Elias, dusk, his profession). The mother's pre-emptive knowledge slightly undercuts protagonist agency at the final beat but doesn't eliminate the cost of his arrived-at stance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the parapet setting, moon-phase synchronization, and ritual gestures (knot-tying, rope-casting) layer pressure that peaks in Seris keeping the drawer pull and both sides standing down. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the final image (parapet stones holding "the faint warmth of gloved hands") reweights the opening's "salt and regret" with undeniable conceptual cost (the negotiator's pocket lighter, heart heavier). The orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guards lower spears without command, narrowing options from recited crimes to shared vulnerability, and the cost—"recycled mistakes settling into bone like slow wisdom"—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning; the piece teaches its recursive motif structure early (compass-pole-regret cycle) and maintains coherence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of kayak moving into "widening yes" with broken compass reweights the opening paralysis with felt cost (abandoning navigation certainty). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening beat. One minor causality slip: the dolphins' arrival feels unmotivated by prior action, more decorative than pressure-driven, though it doesn't break the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seeker exchanges void for responsibility, a stance crystallization with conceptual cost ("heavier yet cleaner"). Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; density increases through the lake sequence and the final image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the ward paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when memory floods back as nausea and borrowed rhythms. The time-traveler loop supplies retroactive causality but arrives late and feels more like thematic garnish than a constraint that shaped prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (barefoot, orchard, phoenix sister). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: two-in-one guardian form with the lullaby sung backward, reweighting prior separation with visible cost (singular creature, no longer separate). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of spice ritual and mythic imagery builds to a pattern break at fusion. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes one must die into the other's form, narrowing options and charging the final merger.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (cartomancer, midnight glade, after the birth) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and metaphor accumulate (time pooling, cloud as cathedral, saucer crack as river/lightning bolt) and the final image of the healed saucer and spoken name reconfigures the dominant stake of reclaiming lost time. However, causality is soft—the cloud "shudders" and descends, the crack "detaches" and strikes her chest, time "rushes back"—without clear because/therefore linkage to the protagonist's prior choices. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid: she accepts the loss, names the daughter, and internalizes the glade), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no payoff; the reader learns setting/situation through lyric fragments rather than grounded anchors. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the closure—slipping through the bruise into a redemptive dimension—offers no legible cost or foreclosed path; it is pure wish-fulfillment arrival. The "locked dimension" opens on cue when joy is declared sufficient, breaking any causal constraint. No meaningful before/after stakes change is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael's reweighting of destitution into "currency"—but the cost remains conceptual and insufficiently tied to a visible forfeiture on the page. The escalation relies on orchestrated coincidences (bugs form lean-to, mountain rearranges path) that complicate but do not narrow Kael's options through his own agency. Orientation is clear early; the midpoint tightening (cave descent) reweights the texture motif, but the final cost is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Garnet at the postern gate during blackout), satisfying the orientation test. Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: coded sundial mechanics and aether manipulation provide causal linkage, while the "cradle of sparks" motif accumulates texture. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (barges freed, fort unlocked, mask dropped) but the cost is asserted rather than felt—"Tell the ministry that their ink has dried" declares revolution without showing what Garnet forfeits or risks in that moment. The night's events succeed too cleanly; Voss is fooled, chains slacken on cue, and dawn arrives with the fort "unlocked in every sense" in a summary flourish that skips the friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure), but orientation debt is significant—"after friction had vanished" and the broader world-state remain abstract past the opening third, with no concrete anchor for what friction's absence means tactically. The closure unit attempts CR: Elias places the final rock and witnesses eels becoming constellation-light, reweighting the promise through dissolution. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the exact on-page sentence where Elias forecloses a living option is not legible. Causality is loose: rock placement follows precognitive vision rather than earned discovery, and the star dust's mechanics are asserted without prior constraint or failure that this sequence overcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where Mara's dissolution into the storm reweights her silenced voice as transmission. Orientation anchors arrive late—"censored poet Mara" and "observatory" establish who and where, but the timeframe and stakes remain abstract until midpoint. The darkroom sequence offers concrete beats (timer set, print emerges, strips dissolve), yet the causal chain from manuscript destruction to metaphorical departure lacks the on-page cost or tactical narrowing that would elevate closure into undeniable pressure. The ending gestures toward transcendence without a legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients clearly (atrium, waiting, sundial code) and follows a Situational lens: waiting crystallizes into shared inquiry. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (rivals become co-authors), but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page—no sentence shows what Elian or Vale forfeits. The sundial puzzle and brook reflection provide causal texture, yet the final turn (walking into the Council chamber) asserts resolution without a dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with orientation debt—who Lark is, why he's in a prison library, and the stakes of the molt take ~150 words to clarify, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The accumulative lens emerges: the spiral reading nest, paper cranes, and stove ritual build toward a thematic reconfiguration. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing—"the library grows too bright for iron walls to hold"—but the cost is largely projected ("will return," "will rebuild") rather than felt on the page in the present window. The Rourke confrontation resolves via convenient logic rather than earned causality, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (station, pianist, broken clock), satisfying the test. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the tidal arbor, film-loop refuge, and layered imagery, culminating in the pianist's decision to leave the loop and sound the chime—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights waiting versus forward motion. Cost is legible in her stepping offscreen with the clock "ticking audibly…its hands still immobile but its chime now free," foreclosing the loop's safety. However, causality is loose: the projectionist's offer, the film's mechanics, and the arbor's descent are linked more by metaphor than because/therefore logic, and the middle section's transitions (shaft to greenhouse to film) lack clear spatial choreography, creating minor orientation drag even after the waiver for lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal escalation within an Accumulative/lyric frame) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Calyx's act of weaving doubt into the fissure reweights the ridge's survival and her identity with conceptual cost (erasure of her mentor's name). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure image—"half real, half dreamed, held up by the collective refusal to decide which half mattered more"—reprices the premise with undeniable pressure. One slip: the dream-sequence causality compresses heavily; the fissure's discovery and the seed's instructions feel compressed rather than earned through prior dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a ritual pattern early (lace instructions, compass transformation) and accumulates pressure through three discrete steps that reweight the apology motif. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the teal needles hold the color, the narrator learns pruning-as-apology, and years later recognizes the hue in twilight—a clear before/after with conceptual cost (the need for silence, the lace's absorption). The cost is felt in the final silence and the bonsai's permanence, though the narrator's agency in the ritual is limited to breath and touch.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: enter greenhouse → gather dust → run experiment → achieve convergence → walk out with a reconfigured stance, all under the same pressure system (post-flood storms and grief). Causality is solid at this scale: her need for silence and data leads her there; the dust leads to algorithmic convergence; the convergence catalyzes her repricing of “catastrophe” and her own trauma. Closure is strong Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she no longer tries to outrun storms, and the cost (accepting her brother’s death as part of gradual change) is legible. It stops short of exceptional only because the external storm/flood stakes never fully narrow her options in the moment (safety never truly pinches), leaving the pressure a bit softer than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: flight from arson → canyon tracking via ledger/frost → campfire revelation → refusal of the mapped path → bus/new studio, with clear because/therefore links. The story uses an accumulative/lyric drive but maintains a causal backbone, and closure lands decisively when she reinterprets the ledger as “permission to step off the path” and acts on it. Cost is present (abandoning pursuit of the smugglers and any justice or profit they represent), though external consequences remain somewhat abstract and danger never re-tightens around her. The single-scene-plus-aftermath frame is coherent and needs no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: brief anchoring backstory, then a single escalating scene in the conservatory, resolving in a conceptual reframe of silence itself. Causality is coherent (scanner → ember → forks → thermal symphony → realization), and the ending provides strong Conceptual Repricing with an emotional cost (letting go of audible sound as the goal). The Great Hush functions as a persistent constraint rather than a puzzle to solve, which fits the accumulative/lyric drive. Nothing important is left dangling, and the final images reweight earlier beats without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: mysterious package → travel to pier → descent to library → discovery of the problem (overdue souls, cracked lens) → devised solution (paper boats, cold fire) → personal cost (becoming keeper). The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative imagistic intensification), and the closure—a decisive acceptance of permanent duty with visible sacrifice—is clear and on-page. The “library backstory” is efficiently folded into the present action, and every set-up (lens, catalog, book, summons) pays off. Cost is legible in the image of his name written into “Perpetual Repose” and the abandoned inland parlor.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: midnight run → meeting boy → visit to Lita → dawn bell moment. The dominant stake (sustaining and evolving the resistance network under sanctions) is legible and tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silent ringing at dawn confirms the network’s endurance while foregrounding ongoing cost and uncertainty about the crates. No orientation or causality slips; the exodus plan and “second ledger” integrate smoothly as future-facing stakes rather than dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single sequence: arrival → camera ritual → wisteria door → orchard → return/reconfiguration. Causality is legible even inside the lyric mode: her learned attention to breath enables the transformation of the projection, which in turn opens the door and makes the orchard—and thus the healing—possible. Closure lands clearly as a conceptual and emotional before/after: from hoarding unused love to releasing and distributing it, with the past-life thread completing its circle. The only limitation is that obstacles are more atmospheric than oppositional; the ritual works smoothly, so the sense of risk is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: maze entry → deepening temporal descent → hawthorn/film revelation → door/keystone choice, with a clear before/after. Causality is coherent under a textural lens (her experiments with geometry and the halo fragment produce the periscope-like maze and its eventual collapse). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis / Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses the door and revalues fading as comfort, with an on-page cost (becoming bound to loss rather than escaping it). Orientation is strong from the first line and the drive lens is consistent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: long preparation → decoding the piano → plan to shield the vault → nonlethal impediment of the guards → wall collapse → vault access and seeding → emblematic arrow shot. The situational clock (imminent wall fall) shapes tactics and keeps pressure coherent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the drive shifts from immediate liberation to long-term seeding. Cost is legible: she risks capture, leaves before securing safety, and we understand the regime will retake the ground. Structure is linear and tight; the only small limiter is that everything goes almost exactly to her plan, leaving little in-scene uncertainty at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece runs as a clean single scene with an accumulative/causal throughline: arrive at the drowned valley → consult keeper/forge → sacrifice preserved absence → receive and reframe the sound of betrayal. Each step follows coherently from the last, with no orientation debt and a clear global drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal beats). Closure is strong: the obsidian shard and her decision to design new hearing aids that reveal “the fragile hush where trust trembles” constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration and Conceptual Repricing of her life’s work, with on-page cost. The final echo of her brother’s laugh within the memory-drinking trees seals the before/after without over-explaining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: flower-code summons → client request → moral risk of reinterpreting → ring/coordinates reveal past erasure → thief chooses restoration instead of further theft. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reweights her own practice (from stealing wanted moments to handling unwanted ones) and hears “destiny breathing back,” which conceptually reprices the premise. The cost is present but slightly soft-focused—there’s mention of thinning the fabric of tomorrow, but we don’t see a concrete, irreversible loss tied to this specific choice beyond a generalized sense of risk and forgoing easy payment. Structurally, the piece stays within one coherent scene, with no orientation or lens issues.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: entering the station → gathering and repurposing debris → crafting the dome → decisive choice to leave it there. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she abandons her flight reflex and redefines “safe zones” as gifts left in place, not talismans to carry away. Every beat arises logically from prior ones (need for fuel leads to breaking the chair; found objects become structural elements; narration habit deepens into credo), and the before/after is legible with emotional cost. No orientation or lens issues; the drive remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: DNA revelation → quest for the shell → clue from the cast → retrieval of the shell → guards’ arrival → projector gambit → decision to leak the footage. The drive lens is primarily causal with thematic overtones, and closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing when Leo chooses to release the uncut reel. Cost is legible: he risks his remaining career and confirms himself as “coward” on film to gain narrative autonomy. Structure is tight within one night’s arc; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulation: opening at the parapet with the last star, intensifying through the act of mapping silence, and resolving when she enters the map. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each step of inscription deepens the world’s transformation and her options narrow as the star dims and the hush thickens. Closure is strong and legible: the oracle’s act triggers a reconfiguration where the fort dissolves and she becomes a coordinate that lets the world’s shoreline “breathe again.” The cost of this closure—her dissolution into the map—is clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous courtyard scene with reflective summaries of prior loops, culminating in J4N-17 playing the violin and arriving at a conceptual shift about thought and the Program. The accumulative/textural drive (loops building understanding) is coherent and pays off in the final realization and stance toward the loop. Causality is largely conceptual rather than event-driven, but the cause-effect chain—procedure → loops → obsession → instrument → insight—is legible. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the Program and the loop itself, with a quiet but clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: stray ticket → investigation in the booth → eavesdropping → retrieval of lens → public screening as resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira shifts from frozen mistrust to chosen, bounded trust with an on-page cost (keeping the prank private while releasing resentment). Structure is linear and contained, with no orientation issues and no dropped setups (the missing lens report pays off well). The main limitation is that external stakes (job loss, institutional fallout) remain mostly implied, keeping the structure elegant but modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: morning ritual → low luck score → secret grove and apple → glove and new ritual, all cohering around the gardener/garden dynamic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the final understanding of mutual tending and the glove/marbles image make the before/after legible. Causality is gentle but consistent—the 0.03% score triggers the garden’s response, and the beats flow logically. The only limitation is that, for elite venues, the pressure curve feels very low-stakes; nothing in the sequence genuinely constrains her choices beyond accepting the garden’s gifts.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative arc with causal beats: walk → lever → projections/visions → realization → returned lever and altered future behavior. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost despite the lyric mode and temporal visions. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she forecloses the path of radical temporal intervention, at a felt cost, while holding open a charged future. The drive lens (mostly accumulative with causal underpinnings) stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain—program → images → staircase → hidden door → violin case → new music—is coherent and easy to follow, and the single POV is clean. The piece lands a real closure beat when he emerges and plays music that “disrupts the world’s expected melodies,” clearly reconfiguring his stance. However, the tension is mostly exploratory; there’s little sense that he could fail or that not following the code has meaningful consequence. The flood and ghost function as atmosphere and guide more than as pressure, so the final change feels more graceful than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean causal and accumulative arc: fever breaks → awareness of swallowed truth → escalating bodily/symbolic pressure → deliberate expulsion and burial of the stone. Orientation is excellent from the first line (who/where/when are all quickly anchored), and the mountain-station frame holds throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “Truth evacuated…valley temporarily innocent” clearly marks a before/after with cost. A very minor limitation is that the stranger’s original request is compressed into one paragraph of backstory, leaving that causal hinge slightly underdeveloped on the page for true top-tier structural perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: brother’s confession → Mara’s prior psychic research → descent into tunnel → discovery and opening of the wheel → paranormal response → reinterpretation of the brother’s guilt. The structure is a single continuous scene with tightly interleaved reflection that always tilts the present action. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: she reweights what “really happened” and her role in it, allowing the ghost shift—and her own fixation—to “finally stop.” The cost is legible in her acceptance of her brother’s failure without metaphysical guarantees.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is cohesive: following the swan deeper, learning the library’s nature, reaching the pit, and transforming into the next swan forms a clear arc with on-page closure and conceptual cost. Causality is soft but legible (“She understood: the library itself was the obsidian refuge… and she its latch” → thus, she must become the next fold); the circular ending with the next keeper reconfigures the premise cleanly. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout and the pattern pays off at closure, though the midsection slightly luxuriates in atmosphere over forward structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: ascent → ritual at eclipse → distributed response in the valley → quiet descent and charged after-effect, all under a single consistent drive lens. Causality is strong in a textural sense—her timing, place, and music lead to the children’s micro-awakenings, and the closure offers a resonant reconfiguration where the world looks unchanged but is not. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic (the “pebble in a shoe” unease that must be carried), yet it lands on the page. Stakes and closure are fully legible, though the lack of more robust on-page resistance keeps it short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative progression: three diaries form a ladder of knowledge culminating in the ritual with the tapestry and silo. Each step (“Axis displaced,” the loose stone, “fire was just another door”) causally reweights what she can do, leading directly to the decisive act on the loading bay floor. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she and the library become the new displaced axis, with a tangible cost and a clear before/after in how the world spins and stories are held. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is tight: Chen arrives, embeds film and prophecy, realizes the cost of staying, and departs; causality is clear and closure lands as a decisive change plus reconfiguration. The accumulative motif work (open secrets, light as darkroom, rock inside you) coheres under a hybrid causal/textural lens. The cost of leaving—abandoning identity, network, and place—is legible, especially in the trade of tools and the keeper’s too-late rush. Stakes never feel muddled, though the external danger implied by the fortune (“rock…inside you”) never materializes as concrete jeopardy, keeping tension more philosophical than suspenseful.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the loops and rhetorical devices progressively destabilize the congregation’s certainties, culminating in the priest diverting the demon into the loop. Causality within the surreal rules is clear (“the demon fed on certainty, and the priest starved it with ambiguity,” leading to the possession’s deflection), and the world’s logic is internally consistent. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: the priest becomes the new dimensional anchor, and faith itself is reconfigured as something safest when self-questioning. The cost of this closure—the priest’s loss of ordinary life and the town’s ongoing, uneasy vigilance—is legibly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: each memory etched on the spire deepens the central project and leads naturally to the symphonic “movements” and final repricing of home and time. Causality is lyric but legible: shell → etching → lake response → music → internal shift, with exhaustion as a persistent constraint that lands on the page. Closure is strong: the ache resolves, the nautilus passes on, and the mirrored horizon becomes portable—an RR/CR that clearly reweights the premise with emotional cost. The only limit is that external stakes remain abstract and entirely interior, which keeps the structural tension from feeling absolutely maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean despite the lyric surrealism: steal tablet → use procedural retracing → encounter fracture/ghost selves → meet elder Kael → erase the “minotaur” by destroying the tablet. The piece sustains a coherent Hybrid (causal + accumulative) drive, with the tablet’s algorithm and the fractures reliably shaping each turn. Closure lands strongly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing, with the timelines collapsing and the boy-with-clocks image reweighting all that came before. A slight abstraction of concrete stakes (what is truly lost beyond identity pattern) keeps it short of utterly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves causally from arrival, to work on the needle, to playback, to emotional breakthrough, with no orientation issues. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural but fully coherent, as each physical step deepens the internal pressure around grief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s stance toward her grief is decisively altered, with visible cost in her tears and the memory of her sister’s laugh. There are no unkept set-ups or causality breaks; every introduced element (needle, drum, backward song) returns meaningfully by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: pigeon → future-dated message → realization of manipulation and surveillance → descent to the rogue zone → retooling of the system via pigeons → chosen stasis underground. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyric texture) and holds through closure, with each step narrowing her honest options under pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to solitude and lateral resistance, foreclosing complicity and easy safety at a real cost. A slight abstraction in how time/“tomorrow’s” message mechanics work is accepted as premise rather than a structural weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative arc: arrival → opening the vial → orchid’s response → conceptual and vocational shift, with each beat deepening the same pressure. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a new role and stance toward grief under the ongoing constraint of a scentless world. Causality is coherent even in lyric mode—the actions with the perfume and orchid feel like “therefore” developments, not random flourishes. The cost (accepting ongoing grief as his trade, forfeiting his prior emotional stasis) is on the page in the trembling knees and the decision to forgo selling lanterns tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present exploration of the grotto → reflections on Marcus and the energy beings → immediate pressure when the beings gather at the mouth. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he refuses transcendence for now and commits to walking under the weight of choice, with a tangible cost (forgoing “weightless eternity”). Causality is soft but coherent under the situational/accumulative lens. The main limitation is that the on-page confrontation remains low-key, making the decisive moment feel more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: entering the ruined greenhouse, planting the seed, playing unresolved fragments, repurposing the bowl, and leaving at dawn form a coherent arc. Causality and motif progression are tight under a textural lens—each musical and physical experiment deepens the central pattern of “unfinished” and directly precedes the next transformation (seed’s tremor, bowl as resonator, hush lifting). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the mendicant’s bowl and family tradition are redefined in the final image, with the cost of solitude and non-resolution clearly implied. Orientation is solid from the opening; no scene breaks or lens shifts muddy the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear because/therefore chain (meeting → petal accepted → emotional inundation → reconfigured stance). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes her detachment and accepts ongoing vulnerability as a new baseline. Stakes stay internal but coherent throughout, and there are no orientation or causality slips. The arc is more of an intensifying slide than a sharply turning plot, but within this mode it lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: music → library → misaddressed envelope → decision to deliver → discovery of Dalia’s legacy → Marisol’s re-logging of the night. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the “cargo/compassion” metaphor is conceptually repriced by the locket transfer and the “miscellaneous inbound—value immeasurable” entry. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but each step meaningfully reweights the central idea of kindness-in-transit. The only ceiling is that the cost at closure is more contemplative than structurally transformative—no option is truly foreclosed beyond the sentimental loss of the locket.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: arrival → hesitation at the arbor → alliance with the twins → deepening search → revelation at the tagged trunk → dedication and forward decision. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens: each step logically follows from Lira’s drive and the orchard’s rules, and the final reconfiguration of “kinship” rests on on-page triggers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—Lira relinquishes her stance as an unthreaded outsider and commits to an ongoing role. Stakes remain intimate rather than dire, but they’re coherent and consistently pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: cadence with the pendant alters time, enabling the upstream walk, leading to the aviary, sacrifice, cavern, and return. The piece holds a coherent hybrid of causal and accumulative drive, and the closure—a reconfigured relationship to time and memory—is legible. The cost of surrendering future minutes is conceptually present but then softened by the pendant’s reappearance, slightly blurring how much has actually been lost. Structure stays within one continuous arc with no orientation issues or unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, ritual-like structure is clear: arrive → attempt with eyes and mosaic → opening of stone → discovery of astrolabe → projection and symbol → orchard’s renewal → departure. Each step causally follows the last, with the silence/problem addressed through increasingly committed acts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard is revived and the narrator gains a new limit for their grief without resolving the loss. The cost is legible in the relinquishing of the astrolabe and seedlings, and in accepting ambiguity rather than forcing an answer.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from solitary caching to active uncaching as voices and pressure build toward recognition. Causality is sound—outage leads to candle/reader, which prompts Elias’s choice to reveal the fragments, culminating in the taped line and “I see you.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from invisible archivist to acknowledged guide, with an implied cost of surrendering solitude and anonymity. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: storm → anomaly → experiment → bodily metamorphosis → aftermath with new owner, all coherently linked. Closure is solidly on the page with a resonant reconfiguration: Mira becomes part of the nursery and the world reorients around that fact at a clear cost (her human life and control). The second-half shift into summary (“The next morning, customers found…”) slightly dilutes immediacy but still maintains causal continuity and a single drive lens. No major set-ups go unkept; the linden behavior, trellis, and storm all recycle meaningfully at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival on the causeway → brooch-triggered discovery → encounter with the old woman → exchange (shard for painting) → creative breakthrough → reconfigured return. Causality is coherent and accumulative: each step arises naturally from the prior one, and the memory-exchange rumor motivates Mara’s presence without infodump. Closure lands as both Decisive Change (she finally sleeps) and conceptual repricing (insomnia recast as vigilance, war as revelation), with the spring water and brooch charging that shift. Stakes are modestly scaled but the before/after is legible and paid for by the weight of her prior sleeplessness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival → guided descent → memory ritual/transfer → enforced acceptance → return to surface → years-later echo, with clear causal links. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves altered, she remains to mineralize into song, and the cave continues recording, reweighting all prior beats. The time jump is handled smoothly and deepens, rather than diffuses, the original stakes by showing long-term consequence. Pressure is more accumulative than sharply turning, but there is one decisive irreversible move (the transfer and sealed transaction) that works well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine—harbor → customs → conservatory → cemetery → return to harbor—is clean and each step is motivated by the need to restore the trumpet. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the archivist finally blows the note that “folded into every doorway,” reweighting absence into communal sound with a clear before/after. Stakes remain primarily symbolic/emotional rather than situationally pinched, but the cost of confronting exile and becoming visible again is legible. Structure holds under a largely accumulative/lyric lens with no orientation or lens-clarity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean causal line—finds the punch, follows the glowing cracks into the “collapsed” tunnel, confronts the fortress, then re-emerges reconfigured—with a legible before/after. Closure is strong: the ticket punch dissolving into paint and the blank canvas functions as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (abandoning his defensive mapping behaviors). The accumulative pattern of repeated motifs (cracks, mist, punch) tightens rather than meanders, and the temporal markers (3:07 / 4:07) bookend the transformation effectively. There are no major causality gaps; the surreal logic stays internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: starlight hitting the tile triggers entangled memories, which lead to using her mother’s patterns, to the tile levitating and the transcription of music, to the whales’ answering chord and her departure. Orientation is excellent from the first line (who/where/when are clear), and the magic’s rules are sketched consistently enough for a lyric piece. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from documenting for academia to composing for connection, then literally leaves the tile for another and walks away with a reweighted stance on grief and knowledge. The only limiter is that the arc from skepticism to acceptance runs very smoothly, with little structural friction or reversal beyond the initial shock.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → shards → vision/compulsion → alliance with mutineers → door → Vey’s renunciatory step, giving solid closure with clear cost. The structure holds as a single continuous scene with embedded memories, and the final choice decisively reconfigures Vey’s options (end of immortality) and the station’s fate. The mutiny’s pivot—from seizing the station to helping Vey—comes a bit quickly, with minimal on-page resistance, which slightly softens the feeling of a hard-won turn. Overall, the drive lens reads predominantly causal with a strong resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: ink pot → deal proposal → magical breach → document rewritten → ink ruined and trade sealed. The single-scene structure in the prep room keeps orientation and stakes clear, with the breach serving as the decisive change and Cassidy mailing the document as concrete closure. Cost is legible on-page both in her lost memory and Rurik’s internal shrapnel of re-hardened convictions. The structure is very sound; only the “waiting” phase is relatively low-tension compared to the excellent climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: silence → ascent → bonsai response → writing compulsion → sacrificial page and transformation, with each beat deepening the premise rather than simply repeating it. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens—the labyrinth “reading her inventories” and the lamp’s hum shifting as she writes create a legible before/after. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: she loses a forgery, gains a charged understanding of history, and the town’s silence is reweighted as “a library of moments waiting for spines.” Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: wandering and collecting → discovery of the poison label → encounter with the dying captain and recorder → deliberate inversion of the poison’s purpose → ritual disposal of the death certificate and re-inscription of memory. Causality holds under a textural lens: each new element reweights the stakes around erasure and remembrance rather than functioning as mere vignette. Closure lands strongly as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: Mara trades the official, bureaucratic self for a distributed presence in the port’s memory-saturated metal, with the cost of ongoing namelessness and risk under surveillance. No orientation or lens-clarity debt; the pattern is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a tight, accumulative single scene: arrival, experiment with the cello, escalating notes/voices, revelation of the compass, and a reweighted departure. Causality is clear under a lyric-fantastic logic (each note → specific voice → cello completing → compass awakening). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Arlen conceptually resolves the riddle (“the riddle was not why the sounds were identical, but why listeners insisted on difference”) and pays the price of leaving without external proof. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, with each beat deepening rather than derailing the core inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: set-up of looming privatization, Lina’s mapping/graffiti decision, midnight assembly, reorganization, and inspectors’ confused retreat, culminating in a charged closing image. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: Syndicate pressure → coded call → collective re-layout → tactical postponement of privatization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise, with the carnival’s self-reinvention and Lina’s internal repositioning clearly marking a before/after. Stakes are resolved only provisionally, but the story is honest about that postponement rather than pretending to a full victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative lyric surface: climb → prepare timers → wait → wind arrives → anemones close → final shots, all governed by the approaching sun. The ticking-clock mechanics of the chemical reactions and UV bleaching are coherent and anchor the narrative spine without exposition bloat. Closure lands solidly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last possible instant is captured, extinction is sealed, and the film becomes the only surviving “color,” with the time-grain reweighted as the last measurable future. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; who/where/when and what’s at stake are clear early and hold through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: broken drone → diagnosis of deeper damage → revelation of battery stress → failed test due to “learned” fear → inventive retraining → successful launch before the ship leaves. The ticking clock of the Aurora’s departure stays active and returns near the climax to sharpen urgency. Closure is decisive and legible: the drone not only flies but flies differently, embodying the story’s premise of fear retranslated into balance. The only slight weakness is how smoothly the retraining solution arrives and works on the first try, reducing perceived risk at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: the call (“convergence”), investigation of the lake, descent, mapping/transmission, and quiet return form a coherent arc with accumulating discoveries. Causality tracks well under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—each fantastical escalation grows from prior details (phrasebook language opening the shaft, microorganisms taking the map). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing + Earned Stasis: Maren’s choice to classify the origin and subvert the Registry is dramatized, and the final images reweight maps, language, and rivers with clear conceptual cost. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (professional and epistemic rather than visceral danger), which keeps the structural impact strong but not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a tight, coherent arc: tuning → partial revival → discovery of the unresolved north ward → sacrifice → reconfigured stasis with Elian as bell. Causality is clear even in lyric mode, and the closure unit (a resonant reconfiguration where Elian becomes the town’s sustaining bell at real cost) lands cleanly. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with causal linkages supporting it. The only minor limitation is that the “unspoken guilt” source is gestured at rather than dramatized, making that obstacle slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is cleanly causal: trapped in a shrinking air pocket → signals are muffled by the temple’s hush → discovery of the organ → insight about feeding it one pure note via the vial → transformed broadcast → rescue. Closure is a blend of Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple shifts from suppressing to amplifying distress, Mira’s distress call succeeds, and she trades her last link to home to rewrite the temple’s role. The cost is legible in her fear of wasting the vial and in leaving it behind while nearly drowning. The drive lens (primarily causal, with accumulative motifs of hush/memory) holds consistently through the final image of the temple’s ongoing aria.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → pursuit of hush through cells → ascent to lantern → encounter with father → descent via reconfigured “lies-staircase.” Causality within the piece’s surreal rules is stable (the lighthouse sustains impossibilities, the lattice changes the lens, which rearranges lies into a staircase), and orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the opening. Closure lands as both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing when Cassian accepts the wolf-role and exits with a new relationship to truth and silence. The “before they find the bodies” timeframe adds situational pressure but is underused tactically, so the clock never quite bites as hard as it promises.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is strong: the bead’s awakening draws her, each visitation escalates pressure, and the orchard’s alchemy culminates in a ritual that resolves the centuries-old debt. The structure—summarized prior nights, then dramatized seventh night—feels purposeful and keeps momentum without confusion. Closure is clear and costly: the debt is extracted, the greenhouse and trees are sacrificed, and she relinquishes her ghosthood. The before/after of both characters’ options is legible and satisfying on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, mythic structure is coherent: dry harbor and nightly disturbances → dream-descent into labyrinth → loom ritual → sea’s return → quiet epilogue. Causality is clear on its own terms (his weaving and sacrifice trigger the reconfiguration of canyon and tide), and the closure delivers a real before/after shift with cost (loss of the plate, the labyrinth sealed, his role ongoing). The drive lens reads solidly as Accumulative/Textural and holds through the ending image of future wanderers. Stakes and turns stay legible despite the lyricism, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrival → investigation of the tomb → discovery of the mirrors → roots’ awakening → root-road to the burned prayer house → sundial ritual that rebuilds the chapel → decision to remain. The global drive reads as hybrid causal/accumulative, with each ritual action both advancing the plot and layering the spiritual reclamation. Closure is strong: the chapel stands, faith reconfigured, and her choice to never leave redefines her interrupted journeys with clear cost. No major setup is abandoned, and temporal progression (“on the fourth dusk,” “when the season turned”) is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is tight: one continuous scene, a clear ticking clock, and a clean on-page closure (she mails the unsigned letter and keeps the confession). Causality is straightforward under a situational/accumulative lens: arrival → chalk work + letters → drone’s early arrival → pressured choice. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never muddles. The ending’s Earned Stasis—choosing unreadness over false exposure—lands with a legible before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clear: she gathers intel while stitching, finishes the map before dawn, reveals the conspiracy via the candle and projector, then actively reroutes the outcome in the confrontation. The drive lens reads Hybrid—causal events carried by accumulative motifs (candle, silence, adjacent possibilities) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the coup’s path is conceptually repriced on the dome. Closure is strong: the world is measurably different (coup averted, cloth distributed, new chart begun) with a legible before/after. No orientation or lens-clarity debt; everything tracks cleanly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/causal structure is clean: regret → following the medium → shard activation → corridor to “the seam” → spoken apology → reconfigured present. Closure is strong and legible as a decisive change: the apology is actually voiced in the charged instant, and its consequences are reweighted in the present and projected future. The cost—facing the old scene and foreclosing the self-protective silence—is felt rather than merely stated. No orientation or lens-clarity issues: the mangrove-labyrinth ritual frame is taught early and held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: present-tense decoding of the cast interwoven with specific past failures, all anchored by the coral and the atrium. Causality is emotional rather than event-heavy—decrypting → recognition of personal guilt → shared re-narration—but the before/after is legible and paid off. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: shrapnel becomes sediment, coral lighter, ache refigured. Stakes remain tightly internal, which limits scale but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal under an accumulative/lyric lens: fog → fragment → Lantern Lattice → living wall → mural/realization forms a coherent chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “lost joy,” with a visible cost paid in the painting process and a reconfigured relationship to memory and grief. The single scene flows without orientation issues despite its lyricism; stakes and goal remain legible throughout. Escalation is more a deepening of the magical rules and emotional implications than a sharp external turn, but it suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story runs on an accumulative/textural drive: garden→failed restoration→nickel’s bargain→nested awakenings→reconfigured stance, all cohering toward a Conceptual Repricing of what “restoration” means. Because/therefore linkages are clean enough—the nickel appears precisely when her usual method fails, and each awakening deepens the premise rather than resetting it. Closure lands strongly in the guide’s answer and Liora’s choice to take the path “where no mural yet existed,” with the cost of relinquished certainty legible. The only limitation is that stakes stay largely philosophical rather than being tested against a more concrete, resistant opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is tight and causal: Arlo plants the first seed, is interrupted by Voss, leverages the club’s systems (cartographer’s placement, pollen, warp) to escape and continue the mission. Orientation is clear early: who he is, where they are, the tax-on-thought premise, and what tonight’s goal is. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the final image of “Resist” vines and refunded dreams reframes the night’s actions as the opening of a broader insurgency—with a conceptual but not bodily cost. The only limitation is that consequences for Arlo personally remain mostly in the realm of risk rather than a felt on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: wind → ascent → apex chamber → postcard revelation → planting → transformed cathedral, all in a clean causal drift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Zale externalizes the burden into the shell, altering both his options (he can sleep) and the world’s (petals drift to future battlefields). The cost—centuries of longing surrendered and his identity as permanent sentinel partially relinquished—is legible in the final descent. The pattern of postcards and lullabies is introduced early enough that the climax feels prepared, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: cracked tube → dwindling bulbs → need to amplify lullaby → chandelier’s price → escalating memory payments → final demand of her own self → tube falling to the child, which reconfigures the premise outward into the living world. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with an accumulative-lyric overlay, and the closure is a decisive change with cost fully on the page. Stakes introduced early (if bulbs go dark, marvels sink into nothing) are confronted directly; no setup is abandoned. The final image of the note traveling the world conceptually reprices the entire system of preservation without breaking any earlier logic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival, attempt, resistance, ritual bargain, and an altered world at the end, all in a single coherent scene. Causality is legible—her use of the ink, the archive’s resistance, and her spoken promise lead to the mural’s change and the archive’s humming—and the before/after of the world is conceptually clear. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: trust becomes an ambient, city-wide music and the archive itself gains agency. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the piece still meets the closure requirement with a strong sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: archive envelope → adhesive analysis → coordinates → hidden tube → lullaby → transformed acoustics → compromise proposal. The structure holds tightly as a single continuous scene with a brief coda at the rim, and the closure (a concrete floodgate schedule plus a reconfigured social contract) lands clearly. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—no confrontation truly threatens to break down—but the sense of an ongoing burden and the founder’s choice echo effectively. Nothing feels unearned or patched after the fact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival and concealment → sanctuary and rebuilding via archives and pigeons → external pressure from constables → off-page escape and lingering legacy. Causality around the “paper trails” bringing danger to the shop and prompting her final dispersal of the song is coherent, and the piece lands a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the final images of children humming and dust motes reconfigured. Cost—abandoning her constructed refuge and leaving only traces—is legible without being over-explained. A slightly more dramatized moment of decision around the constable raid could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-tense investigation at the table is interwoven with backstory about the logbook, mazes, and the butterfly effect, all feeding the decision to step into the between-maze. Causality is soft but legible—reading the wood leads to coordinates, to recognition of “The Threshold,” to understanding the intersection, to stepping off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes loss and distance and exits with a new stance. Stakes are largely internal and conceptual, but the piece maintains one dominant drive without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: a single descent-ritual-ascent arc where each beat (finding the feather, meeting the ghost, performing the rite, resurfacing changed) follows coherently. The accumulative/lyric drive works, with the closure as a resonant reconfiguration—her stance toward knowledge and belonging is visibly altered. The time constraint (submersible leaving at sunrise) is introduced but only lightly pressures tactics, with minimal on-page tradeoffs tied directly to the clock. Closure has conceptual cost (abandoning data, tearing the star-atlas page) but the external stakes could be more sharply felt to reach elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the geode → investigation via seeds → revelation of the cliff’s abandonment → mosaic experiment → new path and mission. Causality is consistent within the surreal logic (bird’s seeds → memory-flowers → understanding → deliberate mosaic spiral → final seed triggering transformation), and the closure unit is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing centered on what makes paths vanish. Cost is conceptual and emotional—the acceptance that old paths stay gone and must be honored in story—but it lands on the page. Very strong structure, just shy of top-tier because the felt price remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: noticing Lila → planting the bishop-and-cup trap → ferret collision → flashlight/guard/bucket spill → emergent community chaos and music → slot machine release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Cipher shifts from micro-managing outcomes to consciously letting the final beat belong to chance, with the jackpot bells proving his method’s power and his choice to relinquish it. Stakes and cost are modest (aesthetic rather than life-altering) but legible and coherent under a causal/accumulative lens. Structure is a single continuous scene with no orientation or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: she enters, initiates the ritual, escalates it as dawn approaches and dust runs out, and exits transformed. Causality under a textural lens holds—each line of verse is a step deeper into the same drive, and the final realization that she “had become the forbidden memory” is a clear resonant reconfiguration with cost. The nostalgia ban and prior exile choice anchor stakes early, and the moonstone’s depletion plus sunrise create a soft clock. It’s more a continuous intensification than a sharp turn, but it lands with satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the bay, divinatory reading of the rings, vision-objects, then the climactic casting of the prism and dispersed healing light. Causality holds under a textural/ritual lens—each step logically follows the last, and the closure image (prism dissolving into windows) reconfigures the premise with clear before/after. Stakes remain internal and metaphysical, but the “ledger at sunrise” and dawn as “audit” give the sequence a discernible clock and cost. The ending is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but for a lyric piece it lands legibly and with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows one continuous ritual on the ridge, with backstory cleanly anchored in the present and used to tilt current choices. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid: the ash, reflection, emotional release, and final decision build sequentially. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from private bearer of ash to someone “commissioned” to speak, with a clear before/after and visible cost. The structure is elegant and unified, though the emotional turn is more seamless than sharply edged, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ritual preparation → balloon descent → equation and mutual recognition → world-level effect → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is legible inside a lyric frame—the patterns complete, the gauge clicks, the balloon appears, and the village’s dreams shift—so the rules feel internally consistent even if abstract. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: hope’s mechanics are redefined and the global drive shifts from desperate repair to ongoing seeding. The main limitation is that constraints and costs on this process are underplayed, which keeps the climactic beats gentle rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: hired to map echoes → discovery of older murmurs/diaries → revelation of lineage and the building-as-camera → descent into the tunnel → final absorption and epilogue. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure—Mira becoming the new echo/negative—is both legible and costly. The rescue-team coda cleanly reconfigures the stakes into an ongoing cycle without feeling like an info-dump. The only slight limitation is that some key moves (her decision to fully submit to the corridor’s pull) are more conceptual than beat-by-beat dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: early world rules (heartbeat as bait, coded lullaby, judging mirrors) feed directly into the third-mirror demand and the final act of sacrifice. Orientation (who/where/when) is established in the opening sentence and never lost, and the terrace → mirrors → bells progression feels coherent. Closure lands with a clear before/after: the heartbeat is given up, the mirror’s behavior changes, and the city’s mirrors begin listening, with a visible conceptual cost in her permanent loss of that tool. A touch more overt narrowing of options before she yields the heartbeat could push pressure even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival, preparation, invocation, communal participation, and transformation of the clipboard into shared light create a coherent arc. Causality is legible—Kaelen’s ritual acts and spoken names draw the former enemies up the steps and into the act of witnessing, leading to the shared burden at the end. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the war is “transformed into something that could be carried, not conquered,” with clear emotional cost. The piece skirts didacticism near the end but doesn’t undermine the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is tight for an accumulative/causal lyric: past dam → manufactured drought → map of cracks → orchestrated storm → egg’s awakening → swallowing the sound, each “because” naturally following the last. Orientation is impeccable from the opening line (who/where/what/why), and the pattern of storm-lull-echo is taught early and paid off at the end when thunder “fills the lull” again. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he internalizes the echo and cost while the world erases all evidence, reweighting the premise that only echo—not preservation—is possible. There are no causality breaks or unkept setups; every introduced element (cloud seeding, map, drought) is cashed out.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric mode: collect echoes → reach sanctuary → perform the unlocking ritual → step into the core → city awakens. The dominant drive is accumulative/textural, but each beat follows logically from the last and closure is decisive (the contract burns, the lullaby breaks, the city changes). The ritual itself unfolds almost too smoothly, with minimal friction or complication once she arrives, which slightly blunts the sense of peril around the stated stakes. Nonetheless, the before/after is unmistakable and the cost—personal and civic—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: argument → retreat to dome → ritual with the stick → vision/reversal → new stance and manifesto. The magical causality of the stick and smoke puppets is coherent within the piece’s logic and leads directly to the decisive change. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in Lucien’s stance with a visible conceptual cost (embracing unanswered questions and ambiguity). The only limitation is that the stakes remain mostly interior and never truly threaten to break his life in a concrete way, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ascent → ritual construction → visitation/recognition → release → descent, with clear causal links (she comes because of the migration; the twin butterfly arrives; the memorial is lifted away). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: after the offering, the world’s forgetting is unchanged, but her relationship to those histories and their fate has shifted, and the final image of the wire cathedral migrating with the monarchs carries legible cost. There is no orientation debt: who/where/when are crisply established, and the magical-real rules stay consistent. The only limitation is that the ritual faces little overt resistance, so the structural “test” of her purpose is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: discovery of the card → entry into the sanctum → braiding ritual → auroral “performance” → reweighted exit. Causality is tight and legible even in a lyric mode; each step grows naturally from the last, with no arbitrary rule-changes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he exits with guilt lightened but burdened by the obligation to carry and release the names, a cost clearly on the page. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and the dominant drive are evident early.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: storm approaching → dream chamber → interpreted dream → transformation → conceptual answer, with a clear before/after in the directive’s rewrite. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Continuity is the art of letting go in the right order” plus “walkers and paths are one another’s becoming,” with the cost of her individuality dissolving into storm/forest systems. Causality is soft but consistent under an accumulative lens; each step logically intensifies rather than resets. The only limitation is that pressure is almost entirely conceptual, so the felt on-page cost, while legible, never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: entering the scriptorium, decoding the square, opening the sanctum, and accepting the covenant form a coherent causal and accumulative arc. The closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: his disappearance and the persistent lapis phenomena recast his quest as successful but self-erasing. Stakes around the coming regime change and erasure of charts are tightly threaded into the night’s deadline. Escalation is modest but purposeful, and there are no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Lira enters, applies her method to two ghosts, triggers the sanctuary’s backlash, confronts her double, and exits reconfigured. Causality is coherent under the metaphysical rules given: “shifting grace” and the sanctuary’s demand for balance explain the apparition of the shadow-Lira and the increased stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lira can now do for herself what she tries to do for others—and the final image of the abandoned music box carries clear before/after weight. A minor limitation is that the sanctuary’s “demand” for balance is stated more than dramatized, but the line still functions structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly causal: the broken sextant and prior failed attempt set up a concrete problem, the breathing ritual opens the corridor, the blood repair enables tethering, and the orchard’s transformation closes the loop. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and never wavers despite the lyricism. Closure lands as a clear decisive change—dream reintegrated, orchard reborn—with a conceptual repricing of what “erasing boundaries” means. The main limitation is how smoothly success arrives once the corridor opens; the outcome never feels seriously in doubt, slightly softening the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain from breached contract to forbidden-bag ritual to orchard revival to generational handoff is clean and legible, with each step motivated by the previous one. Time jumps (“Years later…”) are handled as purposeful summary rather than hand-waving, and the closure beat—older mender satisfied beneath the graft—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with the cost of aging and relinquishment on the page. The global drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative, pattern-rich texture), and that lens holds to the end. A slightly sharper testing moment for failure—something the repair might plausibly not work—would raise the stakes of the structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: command → inquiry → discovery of the orchard’s true nature → realization of the cost → radical reframing at the “Index” door, all linked by because/therefore logic even in a lyric mode. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “The curator is the catalog,” redefining all prior beats and resolving the initial command with a new understanding of inheritance and authorship. The price—erasure of past kindnesses and surrender of a singular self—is legible, though more felt embodiment of that loss could sharpen the impact. The pattern of surreal turns is taught early enough that the mirror-corridor and “Index” door read as earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: time traveler’s arrival → revelation of library → descent, rescue, cipher, entry, theft, and return, all following a coherent because/therefore logic. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s sacrifice and the release of “absences” reprice the premise, with a clear before/after in the world (historians no longer repeating grave errors). The cost is present but thematically more than viscerally felt; there’s limited sense of real risk of failure at each obstacle, as solutions tend to appear at roughly the same intensity they’re introduced. Still, the structural arc is tight for the length, with no orientation or rule-break issues.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ship → card → maze → threads → tarot “Recollect” → naming → sinking, with each step a clear because/therefore. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “garden” is redefined as a tense and internalized, while the ship politely sinks as the old prison/world. Causality is intact even in its lyric mode; no beat feels arbitrary or unearned. The only limit is that external stakes (danger, urgency) remain muted compared to the rich internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: secret door → frozen clock → cryptic directive → rope ritual → restored motion/time folded around the erased village, with the final off-by-one-hour chime as an elegant proof of changed reality. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: absence is no longer pure erasure but relocated memory, and Elara’s catalog entry formalizes that shift. The drive feels like a hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, but the pattern is steady and legible from early on. Stakes are more metaphysical than personal, yet the story sells their weight well enough for the ending to feel genuinely consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: a linear journey from prediction of the hush-window to confrontation in the Great Resonance Dome, with each step (“bloom of hush,” Warden warning, Abyssal Gate) causally linked. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal progression with accumulative lyric texture), and closure satisfies Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the beings are neutralized and silence redefined as resistance and archive. Stakes and constraints (any sound draws the beings; limited hush interval) are maintained consistently, and the ending’s cost—risking exposure to deliver the last map and release all stored words—lands on the page. The only limit is that opposition from the beings themselves remains fairly passive in the climax, making victory feel slightly unresisted.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: shattered prism → missing shard → retrocognition locates it in the past → quest to retrieve → return and rekindling → conceptual shift at the end. The two-part structure (tower, then desert quest, then return) is legible and accumulative, with a clear before/after in the tower’s status and her stance. Closure lands strongly when the lamp ignites and she understands her role in a pattern larger than herself, with the cost embodied by the dead child and her solitary new duty. No orientation or lens-confusion issues; the hybrid causal/lyric drive holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ascent → measurement and impact → brink of self-erasure → revaluation → creation and departure, all causally and thematically linked. The closure is a decisive change (rejecting purity, leaving the Archive’s paradigm) combined with a resonant reconfiguration (identity as mosaic, externalized in the translucent figure). Cost is visible: she relinquishes her prior, Archive-defined self and the chance at being neatly preserved. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) is consistent throughout, and the final beats reweight everything without resorting to explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → encounter with Jax and the rag knot → ascent and guard confrontation → bargain with the governor → ignition and sky’s reopening. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in the world (stars unsealed, social mood inverted) and a resonant final image of the mosaic heart and blooming fortress. Cost is present but somewhat light: Luma’s pledged sacrifice is never truly at risk once the fuse is lit, and the governor’s reversal feels swift. The hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds from start to finish, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene that accumulates pressure from solitary observing → shared watching → object exchange → decision to return to the conversation. The drive lens is accumulative/textural: each natural detail (anemone, brittle star, tide, dawn) reweights the central question of whether this pause can hold reconciliation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they leave the grotto with the conversation explicitly restarted and the cicada now a shared object, with the cost (awkwardness, grief) still ahead but legible. Causality is soft but coherent; each move grows logically from prior emotional beats without orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: each silence collected via a concrete interaction (name, root, trade) escalates toward the column of “absolute mute” and the offer of the final silence. Causality is legible and purposeful: gravity’s inversion enables escape, the trellis leads her to the keeper, the trade makes the doll heavy, and that weight informs the climax. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she rejects the core premise of collecting in order to live differently in the same bunker, and the porcelain click above the clouds seals that cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early despite the lyric mode, so there’s no structural debt.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: storm glass → hexagons → boarding → rising pressure via decibel dial and wind → storm glass clearing → confession → release and quiet denouement. The rule that when “the last crystal dissolved, the rider must speak aloud the fear” provides a clear hinge, and the confession plus terrace’s steadying land as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. Causality within the lyric frame holds without cheats, and the brief coda of Nilo alone reaffirms the system rather than soft-resetting it. Stakes are modest in scope but perfectly scaled to the piece and resolved without feeling pat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: ruby fragment → hidden orchard → murals/door → spiral stair → throne room, with no major logic breaks. Closure is solid—a clear before/after as she ascends and “becomes” the bridge monarch—but the on-page cost at that turn is more implied than felt. The deadline (“until sunrise”) and waterfall pattern shift gesture at pressure but don’t significantly alter tactics or create a real risk of failure. Structurally it’s coherent and complete, but the progression is almost entirely one-way success.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story holds a clear single-scene arc: arrival of the soul, negotiation/ritual, crossing, and a reconfigured but ongoing status quo. Causality is clean—his encroachment triggers the ritual; the sharing of scars enables crossing; his departure yields her repriced understanding of breath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but the before/after is legible and costly. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: night watch → glitch texts → drip line → root-cave ritual → diamond creation → ocean renunciation, with each step causally linked. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric texture, and the closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing (debt cycle broken, interest rate reset, ocean contract voided). Orientation is firm from the opening lines; there’s no spatial or causal confusion. The main structural limitation is that the ritual succeeds without much on-page risk of failure, so escalation hinges more on conceptual stakes than felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Arin seeks the confession, intuits where the crank is, plays the wax, then chooses to publicize the truth, with each step logically arising from the last. The story maintains a single coherent scene with a clear dominant stake (truth vs dynastic identity) and lands a decisive change plus conceptual repricing at the end (the dynasty’s self-image and public narrative are reweighted). Cost is on the page (blood, loss of name, social upheaval), and the final open door functions as an earned Charged Poise. The accumulative lyricism never obscures orientation, though the Muse’s appearance feels thematically useful rather than structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: vow → greenhouse at liminal time → choreography as access method → unsnapping clasp → offered exchange → body/soul trade → new role as guardian. Closure is decisive and fully on-page, with a clear before/after and a substantial cost. The piece operates under a primarily accumulative/textural lens, but causality never breaks and the ending’s conceptual repricing of “possibility” lands. A touch more micro-escalation between the puppet’s offer and the knight’s acceptance could further heighten the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure—discovery of the button → dust-reading → memory → linking to Marcus → re-filing the artifact—builds cleanly toward a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration. Closure lands in the paired beats of filing the button and the snowy walk home, where Rowan reframes archives as “futures disguised as pasts” and her work as active guardianship, not mere custodianship. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each image-driven step tightens her engagement rather than meandering. The cost is implicit but legible: she commits to a path of hopeful intervention that exposes her to renewed attachment and disappointment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: key acquired → lagoon/puddle map → surveillance pressure → booth infiltration → broadcast hack → confrontation, all within one tight scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s soundscape and self-concept shift when erased histories flood public speakers and officers hear their own lullabies. The cost—Mira’s likely arrest or worse—is clearly implied by her surrender in the auric cylinder. Structure is straightforward but well-shaped, with no orientation debt or contrived late rule-changes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: he arrives with an ongoing task, today’s conditions (prism atrium, sun, pressure of the final clause) intensify it, and his tactical musical choices culminate in erasing the prophecy’s last consonant. Causality is coherent under a lyric, quasi-mythic logic: the greenhouse refracts sound, the hush presses back, his chords modulate its power. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—death-day deferred, vow to return, with the world subtly altered. Stakes and cost are legible on the page, though the villagers’ offstage expectations could be tied a bit more tightly into the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure follows a clean causal/accumulative spine: leaves rise → rune message → moonstone decoding → decision to build monuments → communal expansion → releasing the moonstone → mirrored arbor and restored equilibrium. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: memory becomes both ballast and buoyancy, and the arbor’s “problem” is resolved by a reweighted understanding of what should be carried. Causality holds without teleports or amnesia, and the escalation from single leaf to communal rite to global cycle is legible. The cost is largely conceptual—giving memories to the upper arbor rather than a hard on-page sacrifice—which keeps this shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean hybrid of causal and accumulative: the initial discovery causally leads to the cellar journey and the decision to abandon/embrace certain objects, then the later vignettes accumulate the consequences of that choice across time. Closure is strong: his eventual death at three-seventeen and the compass spinning “nowhere and everywhere” read as a resonant reconfiguration of the story’s rules about time and certainty, with clear before/after. Transitions between present adventure and “years later” mosaic are legible and all held under the same drive lens. A minor diffuseness in the middle (sailor lore, tavern talk) slightly softens the sense of a single tightening line of pressure, hence not in the extreme high band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each “limit” test advances both the emotional and metaphysical stakes, leading naturally to the repaired coin and her decision to rejoin the others. Causality is legible (grief → experiment → response of the coin → reconfiguration of her options), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her relation to names and redemption is permanently altered. Orientation (where/who/when) is clear almost immediately and never slips. The only minor limitation is that the external search-party frame feels more like a bracket than an active pressure source, keeping the piece short of truly exceptional structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: new fracture detected → pursuit of the giggle → confrontation at the harp → partial restoration and internalization of the laughter. Orientation is solid early (who, where, when) and there’s a clear closure unit: the giggle is woven back and reweighted into Elara’s body, and the gorge itself reconfigures in response. The cost is present but subtle—her tool dissolves, she carries the laughter within, and she leaves with a promise to return—so the before/after is legible but not starkly sharpened. The drive lens reads as predominantly accumulative/textural with a coherent causal spine, and it holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: waking post-procedure → walking deeper into the forest → successive “equations” → the decisive offering of the strap and exit. Causality under the textural lens holds: each sensory jolt or trauma spasm yields a new mathematical formulation, tightening toward the final limit concept. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: forgiveness reframed as an unattainable limit yet still meaningfully approached, with the cost legible in the self-wounding and abandonment of the strap. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and the rules of the penance are clear enough by the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story teaches its pattern quickly (lyric causal progression in a single outing to the market) and follows a clear chain: market → stall/painting → step through → encounter child-self → return and aftermath. The closure unit is strong: giving back the fragment and leaving the market reconfigure the premise (translation as returning rather than keeping) with felt cost, and the “new lighthouse” plus empty pockets embody that shift. Causality around the time-crossing via painting is implied but coherent within the established magical logic, and there are no unkept set-ups. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with solid causal underpinnings, held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly circular yet progressive: ticket office → climb → time fissure → realization of the loop → choice and exit. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/textural lens: each step (finding the barrel, ghost ladder, crack in time) follows from the last and tightens her options. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses to break the loop by taking the barrel, accepting a cost in ongoing ambiguity and burden. The only small limitation is that the loop’s mechanics stay impressionistic, which slightly mutes the sense of concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: daily ritual → transgressive experiment with the whisper → cascading destabilization → walk into the new order. Causality is strong within the lyric frame (reading frost → inventing sentence → pressing it → rupture), and the closure unit lands as a Conceptual Repricing: rupture redefined as invitation and a new stance taken. Cost is legible in the library’s collapse and the keeper’s dissolution—he sacrifices a “perfect system” for compressed eternity. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal spine) is stable and supports a satisfying before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clear and satisfying: Aurelia arrives to steal the shard → discovers its properties → the visible time-storm approaches → she devises and executes the mirror-covering tactic → the archaeologist intrudes → she chooses to destroy the shard, seeding a new civilization. Closure lands on-page with both Decisive Change (her self-erasure and the shard’s transformation) and Conceptual Repricing (reframing revolution as poetic infrastructure inside the crystal). Cost is legible in her dissolution and in the implied impossibility of returning to ordinary life. Structure is tight and linear within a single scene, with no orientation issues or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → discovery of missing heart → reveal of chip → truth-offering → reactivation → sky opening → homecoming. Closure is decisive and on-page, with the cost being both his vulnerability and surrendering the chip. The structure is linear and almost frictionless—no meaningful setbacks or hard tactical decisions once the terms are known—so escalation feels somewhat gentle. Nonetheless, the single core turn (choosing unsparing honesty to wake the orrery) is sufficient for this length and holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: factory shutdown → compass discovery → stair/lagoon → tribute/transformation, with no set-ups dropped. The accumulative structure of memories and images pays off in a clear closure unit where Ivy gives up her collector stance to become the locus of beginnings. Cost is present but conceptual rather than concrete—she loses her old self and autonomy to a mythic function—which fits the piece’s mode. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens (accumulative/causal hybrid) remains stable through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: GPS failure → arrival at arch → activation of slide → carving ritual → miniature arch + choice to abandon GPS creates a coherent before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Maela accepts a new navigation paradigm and role in the arch’s ledger, with the visible cost of relinquishing technological certainty. Causality within this mythic frame holds—storm, slide, and carving are linked without teleports or rule-breaking—and the single-scene window is well maintained. Stakes are conceptually more than viscerally felt, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure, moving from autumn into and through winter to thaw, is clean and legible, with each seasonal beat reweighting her search. Causality is poetic rather than mechanical but coherent: postcards → winter vigil → branches/rose window → vines and moonflowers → indigo mural → decision to leave and mail the postcard back. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “flowers bloom at night because the dark remembers what the day forgets,” and the mailed postcard plus her departure mark a clear before/after state with cost. Nothing crucial is left unkept or introduced late; the pattern taught early (glass, shadow, bloom) is what resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: salvage mission → discovery of the lagoon’s properties → negotiated exchange → revelation of betrayal → choice to go public. The piece maintains a tight throughline with one dominant stake and a clear before/after pivot at the decision to read aloud over the capital. Closure functions as a decisive change with visible cost, and the retrocognitive mechanism is legible and consistent. The lagoon’s rules are slightly compressed into exposition, but they integrate smoothly enough not to disturb structure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: walking the empty town → rebuilding lanterns → realizing the bottle’s hunger → rejecting it and choosing a ritual that keeps memory unbottled. Causality is consistent under a textural lens, with each act (lanterns, scrolls, burning) tightening the conceptual stakes around how civilization is preserved. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: burying the bottle and committing to serial burning marks a definitive before/after with cost. The only slight limitation is that the “rules” around the wish and bottle remain evocatively vague rather than fully pressured in concrete on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: foghorn’s last note → falling shaving → emergent Hittite phrase → decision to immerse → field-trip memory reveal → realization that the foghorn has migrated into him and will erase the orchard. Causality is clear within a lyric, slightly fantastical frame, and the flashback is concretely cued by water touching wax and directly reconfigures the present choice. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: Ambrose’s role and the city’s relation to grief are redefined with felt cost. If anything, the external objective situation (what concretely happens after he answers the door) remains suggested rather than pushed into a sharper on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: egg hatches → vortex awakens → seeds are drawn in → she uses the acorn and ancestral sap to alter the vortex and choose a new configuration of time. The story holds a consistent hybrid lens (causal with accumulative lyric texture) and lands a clear Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing when she splits the bead and shares the spiral. Stakes and rules are embedded in images rather than exposition, yet closure remains legible and paid off in the final walk from the atrium. Because the pressure is more metaphysical than situational, some readers may feel the threat as slightly abstract rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and cumulative: the ticking clock to 04:00, the barometric anomalies, and the rope’s “tug” all funnel into the core decision to subvert the siren. Causality is intact—her prior observations justify the experiment, and the mountain’s “response” via the bell is prepared by the pitch-shift mystery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she emerges with a new understanding of her work and leaves a changed system (the toggle) in place, with conceptual and professional cost implied. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored almost immediately and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tight: his nightly routine with the lantern → anomalous lingering reflections → dialog with meteors → embedded fleck → cosmic vision → decision to leave. Each beat follows naturally and deepens the central drive toward understanding vulnerability, with no orientation debt. Closure lands cleanly via a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward strength, burning, and openness is reweighted, and the observatory’s later state reflects that change with conceptual and emotional cost. The brief time jump to “years later” reinforces the closure rather than feeling like a bolt-on epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: daily ritual → new ghost/transfer of words → fracture/dream of catastrophe → dawn choice and vow. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—the arrival of the child and the crack in the pane organically force Alden to confront whether to maintain or abandon the covenant. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR when he decides to remain and bind himself to the box (“I will hold you until the desert flowers”), with the cost visible in the lifelong commitment and implied risk. Orientation (who/where/what the box is) is anchored early and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: emerald silo → time capsule → tags → noon experience → garage sale → trade, each step deepening the premise of time without numbers. Causality is soft but coherent—finding the capsule leads to deciphering the town’s workaround and reorients his quest. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when he understands time as exchanged sensations and literally trades his most charged object. The final line is slightly abrupt (“By dusk, the sale dispersed”) but doesn’t undercut the sense of a before/after in his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design with a clean Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing at the end: he accepts “incomplete” as the doorway to beauty and lets the tide erase his statement. Causality is subtle but coherent: storm-wounded horizon → fragment-gathering → collaborative music/poetry → outward-walk of the spiral → acceptance and erasure. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the recurring kite/feather/spiral motifs pay off structurally at closure. The cost is more existential than plot-driven, so the before/after is felt but quiet rather than sharply narrowed in options.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: diagnosis and tree-splitting → decision to remodel → progressive wiring and tests (bats, fox) → final treaty-circuit and departure. Causality is consistent under a textural lens—each new wiring action deepens the system until the orchard can “inhale as one organism” and sign the contract. Closure lands hard: Mara binds her last diary page into the circuit, explicitly offers her name and pulse, and then walks away, with the orchard broadcasting at “twenty-four beats per minute,” a resonant reconfiguration that clearly marks a before/after with the cost of her remaining life. Time, place, and stakes are all clearly anchored early, and there are no unkept setups or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → activation of the tower → spore experience → collapse and renunciation, with clear causal links and no orientation debt. The closure reads as a conceptual repricing: “return” is redefined from reunion to reaction, and she chooses to walk away studying decay instead of seeking home. Cost is legible in the erasure of the path, the empty amber, and the tower’s loss, even if emotionally understated. The drive lens (largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: arrival → locating the bloodiest acre via the gull → choosing a specific pod → speaking dead tongues → seeds transforming the battlefield → his vow and departure. Closure is strong, with a resonant reconfiguration as the battlefield becomes a garden and his role redefines from weapon-bearer to seed-bearer, with on-page cost in his bleeding tongue and relinquished past function. The accumulative, ritualistic structure is consistent and legible, with no orientation debt. The only limitation is that the ritual encounters almost no friction, so the structural turn lands more as inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal thread is strong: discovery of the cylinder → riddle → decoding via leaf and player → journey → rescue, with no major logic gaps. Closure is on-page and concrete (they find and free the brother), and the conceptual repricing of distance at the end lands cleanly. However, once the needle cuts new coordinates, the path feels almost frictionless; there’s little sense that anything might fail or cost them more than effort. A touch more complication or consequence in the journey or the decode would raise the structural pressure to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: grief ritual → compass anomaly/voice → light under hatch → crawlspace maps → corridor → reunion and implied departure, capped by the future visitors frame. The piece operates on a primarily accumulative/lyric lens, but the supernatural turn is still causally grounded in prior motifs (compass, anniversaries, closure of the deck). Closure is strong and legible: Kael moves from isolated mourning to joining a temporally displaced pocket with his mother, and the external world receives a charged relic. The only minor limitation is that the mechanics of the station’s out-of-phase state are hinted rather than dramatized, though this doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: climb → encounter → chess game → tilt into the impossible → ascension and collapse → apprenticeship passed on. Causality is sound under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the secret-bishop swap directly enables the board’s physical/ontological shift and the stair invitation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—the world’s rules have been amended, and the role passed forward with visible costs (loss of spire, loss of artifact, identity shift). Stakes are more conceptual than visceral, but for this mode they register clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from solitary ritual to intrusion to a fragile, new compact. Causality is clear under an accumulative/situational lens: her memory-walk draws the patrol in, Kestrel’s choice not to shoot reframes the situation, and their shared game and final walk create a quiet but definite reconfiguration. Closure lands as a charged poise: they exit allied under a new “kingdom of small gestures,” with the cost being their rejected roles as enforcer/prop. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than plot-heavy, but the piece doesn’t promise more than it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: buried talents → need for the stone → labyrinth search → custodian’s bargain → refusal and collapse → return home. Closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: she gives up her abilities as a seer, destroys the mountain-bookstore, and fundamentally alters her relationship to memory and home with a clear cost. Each beat (“seeded them between pages,” the bargain, the cracking of her reflection, the final burial of the stone) pays off prior setup without late rule-breaking. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a strong lyric surface and holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: present action (fountain, tapestry) → interpretive decoding → embodied test in the maze → closure at the stone board. Causality is tight under the chosen premise: his internal reframing perturbs the enchantment, and righting the king breaks the stasis, so the closure cost (letting the world and consequences resume) is on the page. Backstory is interleaved with precise anchors (the duke’s daughter, the library) and each reflection shifts how he engages the current puzzle. The before/after of his exile status and self-conception is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one tight window before the ritual, with clear because/therefore links from Lira’s actions (light refraction, improvised verse, then listening) to the spire’s transformation and feather reward. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts cost, abandons the priests’ ritual, and claims a new narrative through art, with the split spire and doubled shadow marking a before/after. Causality is intentionally mystical but internally consistent; the canyon’s rules are learned through trial rather than exposition. Stakes remain primarily internal and symbolic, so the external “ritual” threat never fully materializes into on-page confrontation, which keeps this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scene is tightly structured: observation of the statue leads to experimentation with the charm, to recognition, to the cost transfer that sinks the workshop. Causality is clean and the closure—healed statue versus doomed workshop—lands with both physical and conceptual cost. The countdown of chains and breaths gives the piece a clear spine despite the lyric mode. There is slight time-stretching relative to “thirteen seconds,” but it doesn’t significantly damage coherence or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: cracked mirror → abandoned quay painting → inland detour to honor the secret promise → accidental cave discovery → shell → decision to create and then conceal the copy → departure as demolition proceeds. The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens but never loses structural clarity; each new environment (town, path, cave, bus) corresponds to a meaningful turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the quay is destroyed above while preserved below, and Ren’s stance toward loss shifts from futile resistance to hidden transference. The cost—leaving his subject and town to forget themselves—is concretely on the page at demolition and bus-boarding.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: waiting for the heat to break → ascent and ritual in the lamp room → descent to the garden → experiment with cork and beckoning → small external confirmation via the boat. Causality is soft but legible under the chosen lens; the closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing where she reinterprets her mother’s “drowning” as transmutation into subtle vibrations. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/emotional—she accepts a life of ongoing, quiet transmission rather than reunion. The lack of stronger external resistance or sharper turns keeps this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative-causal structure: each cryptic phone call drives a new concrete action (spiral of hoses, soldered hair, speaking into the censer) that tightens toward the climax. Closure is both decisive and costly when she steps into the center, the station lifts as “idea,” and she becomes the lost place others will navigate. Setups (hydraulics failure, moon-phase movement, censer foot, unsent signals) all pay off in the backward migration and final transformation. The before/after is legible and charged without any causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous descent–experiment–partial catastrophe–reconfiguration arc anchored in a single location. Causality holds under an accumulative lens: the relic eye and cure attempt escalate into the accidental spill and luminous film, which forces a more radical confrontation than the planned dose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she abandons the “cure” fantasy and repurposes it, with the ravine now internalized, and the cost of ongoing exposure acknowledged. No significant orientation or lens-clarity issues, though the empathy virus premise remains intentionally sketched rather than mechanistically worked through.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: stranger’s death and the flower → investigation via “gaps” → discovery of temporal/memory loop → decision to repay by relinquishing the flower and its borrowed memories. Structure is a single, continuous scene with clear progression and one decisive turn at the balcony vision, leading to an on-page closure where the world’s asymmetries reset at visible cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first sentence, and the rules of the quasi-uncanny pattern are taught through repetition and then fulfilled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in both reality and Maris’s internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the chip → supernatural activation → ants as guides → hidden passage → cavern → doorway choice, all under a single POV with solid orientation. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change: he steps through, leaving his former life behind. The creek and rising water provide a loose temporal frame, but they don’t significantly constrain tactics. The main structural limitation is that no beat seriously complicates his path; escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: warnings → social erasure → ascent → revelation of the time-loop curse → binary choice at the crown. Closure is decisive and on-page: she chooses to stay, burn her memories into the crown, and thereby restore her name to the kingdom at visible cost. The loop structure (future self sending dreams back) is legible and reconfigures earlier “prophecy” as retrocausal memory. A touch more resistance or alternative tactic at the crest could further sharpen the final trade-off, but the existing structure holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scene is cleanly structured: we open anchored at the ember nexus with Corin’s object and dilemma, move through the confrontation with Mira, then land on a decisive reconfiguration when he uses a pocket-sun differently. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural drive—each reflection and revelation (“I’ve been selling absence”) tightens toward the final act. Closure is strong: the shell’s reweighted meaning and the new use of the suns mark a before/after with conceptual and relational cost. The main constraint is that external stakes remain quiet and the Guild/mentor frame is gestured at rather than pushed into on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: cabin → grave recollection → scroll instructions → mounting dream pressure → erasure in the snow, all cohering under an internal-existential drive lens. Causality is soft but legible—discovering the grave reweights her relation to the scroll, and the scroll’s imperatives guide her stance at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: accepting cyclical time and erasure as continuation rather than clinging to story as ladder. A hairline critique is that the move from “record the flight, but do not land” to “let the mountain erase the scroll” is more conceptual rhyme than fully dramatized decision path.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: introduction of loss and workplace, engagement with the screw, deepening via associations and realization of its origin, then a reconfigured stance in the final walk into the city. Causality is emotional/textural but coherent—each perception of the screw’s detail leads to the conceptual leap about the midwife and the reweighting of the clock. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with clear before/after: her work shifts from trying to get smell back to midwifing meaning despite absence. No orientation or lens-clarity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative surface: superstition → renewed attempt under stricter conditions → successful but costly rune → reconfigured relationship to the brother’s death. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence; we always know where we are, who is present, and what the clock is (kettle plume, storm). Closure lands sharply when the rune inverts its past failure—breath crystallizing, turning into sentences, then soaking into the page—and the rock’s rise gives a decisive before/after image. The emotional and magical costs are on the page, not implied in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight: arrival → guided discovery via induced currents → confrontation with the ghost → apology and release → exit through the now-violated orchard, all in one coherent scene. Causality is clean under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens; every magical element (the bottle, the currents, the archive’s “memory”) participates in the progression. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she cannot undo the exorcism but alters the relationship from trapped ghost to released echo, with felt cost. No orientation issues; the stakes and situation are legible from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tight: arrival → destabilized dictionary → spiral activation → memory arbitration → self-puncture at the center, all logically linked by the library’s rules. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: “The witness is the witnessed” and her absorption into the spiral reweight everything that preceded with a real cost (loss of memories/identity). The “universe’s hiccup” and the spiral arbitration rules give a coherent rule-set that holds through the end. A very slight softness is that the “cartographer of endings” backstory is more told than dramatized, so its loss at closure is intellectually rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive: anomaly → investigation/back-counting → reversal of the hydraulics → dissolution into a new temporal understanding. Causality is clear enough (the uphill water and the whistle-linked anomaly prompt the investigation), and the closure—a conceptual repricing of what clocks measure—lands on the page with a clear before/after. The daughter’s death is integrated as a pivotal hinge in the anomaly’s origin and not just a decorative grief note. Structure is linear with reflective braids and holds together without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → topology fold discovery → Luc doubles → ethical/ontological choice → merge at the spiral, with clear because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as a decisive act (guiding both Lucs into the spiral) plus conceptual repricing (no original/copy; only choice) with a legible emotional cost. The topology/fold mechanics are just clear enough to support the action, though they flirt with being more metaphoric than rule-bound. A slightly longer beat on post-merge fallout could deepen the sense of irreversible consequence, but the before/after is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clear: a causal progression from library → discovery of diary → reinterpretation of the scrawls → new behavior in the city → symbolic return to the library. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (the archive, the book, the lantern) and never fully stalls momentum. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to the father’s contradictions and to her own movement through the city is reweighted with visible cost and new options. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with enough causal spine to feel coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight and legible: the wrong number incites, the repeated calls deepen, the invitation to the tunnel forces a test, and cutting the wires plus stepping onto the track delivers clear closure with cost. Causality under a hybrid/accumulative lens holds: the disc’s behavior, the calls, and the gate opening all follow from prior motifs without feeling arbitrary. The emergency phone finally ringing introduces a live external stake at the end, and his refusal crystallizes the internal arc. The only slight softness is that this emergency arrives very late and is not foreshadowed as anything but theoretical, which blunts its shock a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure (jetty scene → apartment scene) is clean, with each beat logically following: documentation under a time limit, planting the tube, then living with the loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines “keeping” by embedding her own memory-object in the archive and then adjusting to its absence at home. The global drive is textural rather than causal, but cause-and-effect within that frame (demolition tomorrow, security rounds, her urgency) is coherent. A slightly sharper on-page pivot at the moment she decides to sacrifice the locket could deepen the felt hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: abandoned station → encounter with Lila → moon seeds → rumor-fueled crowds → the clock’s shift and Kit’s departure. Causality is legible even within the lyrical compression (his gift leads to seeds, which lead to ivy arches, rumors, and pilgrims; accumulated reciprocity leads to the clock restarting). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kit’s stance toward loneliness and time shifts, and he forecloses staying once the station’s role has changed. The only limitation, for a top-tier venue, is that escalation is mostly narrated in montage rather than felt through a few more concretely dramatized turning beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a linear journey into the forest and to the stillpoint, followed by a brief outward return, with each beat tightening toward the clearing. Causality and patterning are coherent under a textural drive lens (ring pulses → trail of notes → spiral → stillpoint → release of language → reconfigured path). Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when he internalizes the map, reweights what “mapping” means, and reorients his future bearings. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early despite the lyricism, so disorientation never undercuts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds a clear single-scene structure: anomaly flares → Mira decides to intervene → she rewrites the filament → relationship with cosmos reconfigures. Causality is surreal but coherent under the world’s rules (editing filaments alters how the past event resonates into tomorrow’s child). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her “wrong” seeds are reframed as “early,” and the cosmos shifts from hostile noise to dialogic partner. The mechanics of contingent-editing are somewhat told rather than tested, but they don’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → progressive subtraction of sounds around the harbor → rooftop climax → lingering dawn coda. Causality holds under a lyric, quasi-mythic logic: each silence removed leads to the humming camera and culminates in the single harbor note that reconfigures the town. Closure is strong—a clear before/after in how the town relates to sound and silence, with a felt conceptual cost in what’s been erased and who has vanished. The only limit is that the advisor’s departure and the town’s adjustment are more elegiac than pressured, so the change feels profound but not sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain—artistic trail → archive → tapestry → revelation → exit—is coherent and oriented, and the closure (reframing her arson as revelation and assuming the archivist role) lands clearly. However, there is almost no resistance or complication: every step works on the first try, the tapestry obligingly “glows” and reweaves itself, and the collapsing archive happens right after the goal is achieved without forcing an additional choice. The Global Drive Lens reads as causal, but escalation is intellectual rather than pressured, and the cost of success remains mostly conceptual. This keeps the structure functional but not yet gripping or competitive for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: experimental alteration → overload in the garden → decision to risk the lagoon → reconfiguration of her relationship to the entangled memories. Closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration: she moves from trying to expel foreign memories to conducting a shared dream, with a clear before/after in her stance. Transitions are legible and temporally coherent, and the final return to the quartz bough gives a satisfying circular cadence. Cost (relinquishing intimate access to others’ lives while remaining entangled) is evident but could be underlined slightly more in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: storm ⇒ GPS failure ⇒ reliance on maps ⇒ meeting the woman ⇒ sound-based key test ⇒ hidden chamber ⇒ conceptual repricing of the labyrinth. Orientation is strong from the first line, and the single-scene structure holds without confusion. Closure lands as a clear conceptual shift: Mira’s understanding of the labyrinth and its purpose is reweighted with a cost (her prior work’s partiality, the revelation of a hidden order). The main weakness is that tension resolves smoothly without any substantive obstacle or reversal beyond “will the door open.”

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: each action with mirror and shutters incrementally reconfigures the relationship between guardian, canal, and darkness. Causality is clean—her decision to weave, the evoked memory of the lost child, and the darkness’s “recognition” all build to a conceptual repricing where darkness now cradles starlight instead of erasing it. Closure is strong and on-page: the canal keeps its “new secret,” and bargemen carry a re-taught darkness inside them. Stakes stay mostly interior and metaphysical, so the structural arc feels exquisitely shaped but not maximal in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: note → nocturnal preparations → gathering → ritual planting → town-wide repercussion, with each move deepening rather than merely repeating. Causality holds even in the magical elements: the grotto guides her, the window displays seed the town’s transformation, and the ritual literally roots the change. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the next match” no longer belongs to the board but to consciousness, and that shift is legible and on the page. The cost is subtle but present: the town’s order is unsettled and Mara chooses to leave a catalytic object behind, relinquishing private control.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: from the morning-after premise through descent to the fringe, the whale call, communal joining, and the island’s final detachment into a raft-city, each beat causally follows. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric pressure), and closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Lira and the community quite literally reconfigure their island. The cost—abandoning fixed land and Brine Jack’s legacy—is legible in the snapping last root and her relinquishing the scrimshaw. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the before/after line is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is tight: we move from solitary whittling under oppressive hush through crow intervention and the officer’s arrival to a ritualistic planting and a small atmospheric shift. Causality is soft but consistent (mandate → silence ordinance → monitored sound → whittling/narration as risky acts → crow’s sabotage → shared planting), and the pattern of repetition/reprise is clear. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final log entry and flapping wrapper reprice “remade hush” and grief’s weight at a conceptual cost. There are no orientation or lens slips; the single scene holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival after the ban, engagement with the quartz, paraphrasing the law, crossing the lake, and departure all track causally under a lyric lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing in which law becomes environment and the lake’s status shifts from sealed moral surface to a perpetually rewriting text, with her self-erasure as the cost. The risk of failure (refreezing into precedent) is introduced and held, even if not pushed to maximum visceral intensity. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the first paragraph, and the drive lens remains stable through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clear: phoenix ash → barter → evolving conversation via plants → eye-awakening → collaborative creation/destruction → enduring garden. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of damage/beauty—is decisive and legible with cost (Milo giving up painting, the eye dimming). Transitions across “days” are smooth, with each phase reweighting the last. The only slight limit is that the global “bartered awakenings” custom is more gestured at than structurally interrogated, keeping the arc just shy of formally airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: arrival → confrontation with the lab’s purpose → questioning → collective shift → redefined space, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the laboratory is reconfigured from “lost sounds” to “learning sounds” and the lens is left behind. Causality is soft but legible—her question and song lead to dismantling equipment and a new mode of use. The main limitation is how smoothly this all unfolds, with no beat where change feels contested or truly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: she creates and places origami in successive locations, each deepening the conceptual map, culminating in folding the stencil and choosing to depart. Causality is coherent—daughter’s coordinates → observatory → decade of work → origami method → decision to leave—and the observatory’s rules stay stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from preserving the dead to celebrating through change, with a clear before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that most turns are reflective rather than dramatized under fresh pressure, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: a ritual that builds stepwise from laying cards to mapping vectors to discovering the leveraged-debt sigil and the infinite regression of collapse-maps. Causality is clean within this mode—each step logically extends the previous one, and the inherited-mystery thread ties past (grandmother) to present (crypto crash) to recursive future. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the map, recognizes its infinite regress, and chooses to archive it, with the cost being ongoing isolation and the city’s obliviousness. Stakes are conceptual rather than urgent, but they are coherent and clearly resolved under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: entry into the archive, deepening confrontation with its seductions, a pivot at the librarian offer, and reconfiguration in the communal future. Causality is coherent within the surreal logic: avoiding patterns → evading algorithms → finding the exit; accepting the pagoda-as-locket → carrying memory outward. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: purification is reconceived as bearing broken memory together, and the final image of “lanterns…against the growing dark” makes a clear before/after. Pressure is more tonal than plot-driven, so while effective, it never quite tightens into a sharp, dilemma-like hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is very clear: stone warms → vault comparison → revealed metamorphosis → library upheaval → balcony dilemma → vault closure. Causality holds at every step under a lyric, textural drive lens, and the single throughline (what to do with the stone/hope) never blurs. Closure is an on-page Earned Stasis/RR: Mira forecloses sharing and self-effaces into the dusk image, with explicit cost. The time-bending final shard (“somewhere in the space between decades”) still reads as a coherent coda rather than a new arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight: the present-tense crisis (post-con) motivates a sequence of concrete acts—removing symbols, confronting the bodies, building the plaque, then releasing Aster. Causality reads cleanly under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: each ritual step deepens the problem rather than resetting it, and the final release reconfigures Miren’s relationship to her craft. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses to continue her work under a new, self-suspicious code at real reputational and emotional cost. The absence of on-page discovery of the con is felt but not structurally damaging, as the story is about response, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is strong: serum → plant telepathy → coffee-ring tunnel → confrontation with displaced miracle → blood trade → seed ingestion. The piece maintains a single coherent throughline from waking in the tower to making the sacrifice, with the experiment and backstory cleanly feeding present choices. Closure is excellent: the seed and the refigured wound clearly mark a before/after with emotional cost. No orientation debt; the lyricism never obscures who/where/when or why events follow one another.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara comes to the palace with a goal, uses the film strip and crystal, which triggers visions, animates the projector, and leads to the discovery and reconfiguration of the letter. Structure is linear and coherent, with one primary escalation run from reading the strip to altering it and then receiving the reweighted message. Closure is strong: the final image of the letter/film threading into her chest is a clear resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost (she must let the goodbye letter burn and carry its love forward). The main limitation is that the world’s magical rules are accepted rather than built toward with constraint; events unfold with minimal resistance, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is lucid for a lyric piece: we move from arrival → divination through meteors → interpretive warning → dismantling → self-sacrificial transformation, with each step causally emerging from the last under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation (who/where/what the device is) is established early and never lost, and the backstory fragment is cleanly anchored and feeds the present choice. Closure is strong: her dissolution into “remembered stardust” and the later travelers’ legend reconfigure the premise with clear conceptual and emotional cost. The only limitation is that the world-level consequence (“every artist born after her…”) stays more told than dramatized, so the macro-stakes feel slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: from static ritual with the clock to discovery of the strongbox to the temporal/radiant transformation of the children and redistribution of the lullabies. Causality within the lyrical frame is coherent: each new element (box, pages, wave functions) escalates and leads to the guard’s decisive act of planting the clock. Closure is strong and legible—a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the image of the clock keeping divergent time and the lullaby traveling “occasionally everywhere.” The only limitation is that the guard never feels near failure; pressure rises conceptually more than situationally.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric arc: awakening → revelation at the mercury brook → ultimatum on the elevator → renunciation → reconfiguration into myth. Causality is dreamlike but consistent with the taught rules (translocation, gears as mind-flakes, forest as sentient system) and closure lands firmly when she gives up the gear and refuses the metro return. The conceptual repricing—“You are not lost; you are distributed”—reweights all prior translocations with real cost and coherence. No major setup is left hanging, and the circular return via the copper banyan and later travelers tightens the pattern rather than soft-resets it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is lucid: leash breaks → crossing endangered → guides must track hound via indirect routes → confrontation → reconsecration and restored order. Closure is a clear decisive change plus conceptual repricing of the leash as chosen role, and the world settles coherently afterward. However, the stakes remain largely notional (no concrete soul imperiled on the page), and the recovery feels almost frictionless once they find the hound. The final sentence is syntactically cut off, slightly blurring the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single present-tense surgery frame interleaved with tightly anchored reflection builds toward the closing conceptual repricing of “safety” vs. stolen voices. Causality is intact—each element (decree, bolt, boy’s mutilation, surgery) scaffolds the final stance without retroactive patching. Closure lands on-page as a charged poise: the fortress’s “decision” and the imagined future rolling bolt reconfigure what the silence has meant. The backstory never disorients; it consistently tilts the present rather than drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: long search → planted clues → pretender’s prideful reading → ink contact → rune activation → public unmasking. The story anchors who/where/when early and uses the “pause of shifting constellations” as a coherent temporal frame. Closure is decisive and legible: the glamour is sundered, the man’s identity collapses, and the library/world shift into a new stasis with conceptual cost. The only limit is that alternative outcomes or genuine tactical risk feel underdeveloped, making the arc highly controlled but somewhat low in suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: an anomalous tapping → discovery of the torn atlas page → recognition of Path 27 → underwater investigation → activation of the pillars and holographic reef → repriced understanding of her role. The drive lens reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, with the investigation structure supported by recurring motifs (tapping, maps, missing paths). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after (witness of loss → keeper of the way back) is legible with conceptual cost. Stakes stay mostly conceptual and personal rather than materially pressured, which keeps the structure from feeling truly high-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation (who/where/when) is clean very early, and the causal chain—song → awakened stones → energized spaceport → shuttle launch and broadcast—reads coherent under a lightly mythic, causal lens. The story builds to a clear Decisive Change: she leaves the planet, reignites the spaceport, and redefines the lull in rebellion as gathered breath, with some conceptual cost in her leaving. Certain beats (dormant shuttle flawlessly reanimating, militia channels instantly carrying the song) lean on convenient magic, softening the sense of hard-won consequence. Still, the closure unit is legible and satisfying, with a clear before/after in both her stance and the world’s state.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: kite → coordinates → grotto → embryo alteration → concealed escape, with each step logically emerging from the last and from Nara’s plant-telepathy. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: one embryo is irreversibly altered and hidden, foreclosing the council’s total control while leaving Nara under ongoing danger. Cost and constraint are legible on the page (her age, the guard, the lottery clock, the secrecy), even though no immediate punishment falls. Structure is tight for the length, though the guard’s neutralization is a bit frictionless, shaving a touch off the final sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a single walk along the cliff, with reflection interleaved but always anchored to present stimuli. Each beat (plants as markers, the freeze exercise, transferring Nadia’s image, then releasing the photo) tightens the same core decision about how to live with grief. Closure is an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator redefines survival as “diligence” and continuation, not clerical error, and this is embodied in the act of turning inland. Cost is legible in the final relinquishment of the photo and the decisive shift in stance toward “possible mornings.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural arc: enter the lighthouse in decay → find and redesign the tarot fragments → descend to the mirror → choose to step through into the sea, with each move narrowing options and deepening cost. Causality is clean in its own surreal logic (the reconfigured card enabling light, then the mirror door, then the drowning), and the collapsing lighthouse provides a persistent ticking constraint. Closure lands firmly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the sealed mirror and villagers’ question reframes art vs. world at real cost (Elian’s death/erasure). The only reason this doesn’t edge into 9+ is that a few transitions (e.g., from redesigned card to functional lantern-door) lean on dream-logic more than dramatized choice, slightly softening the sense of sharpened options.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: footprint → drone + ink → trail → journal → shadow/portal → Lyra’s revelation → Kael’s choice, with no obvious logic gaps. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and the closure (his step into the portal, revaluing “time slowing” as defense/gift) lands on the page with a real conceptual and implied relational cost. Structure is linear and well-contained in one scene; the temporal weirdness is introduced and paid off coherently. The only limitation is that the temporal-defense premise is largely explained rather than dramatized under direct pressure, slightly reducing the felt stakes of the final leap.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: false alarm → illicit letter → moral reckoning → crawl to the hatch → upload → return to pod as the consequences ignite above. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: Sera has irrevocably changed the world while freezing herself back into vulnerability, with cost legible in the explosions and approaching footsteps. Orientation is excellent from the first line (who/where/why) and never slips, and no setup is left unkept. A slight limit is that the external fallout is summarized rather than partly dramatized, keeping this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: we move from discovery of the sandbag scrap to its integration into the new roses and the planting that closes the loop. Causality is straightforward—tower fall → father’s death → scrap → grafting ritual → new variety planted at the crash site—and the closure image of roots taking hold lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the greenhouse frame holds throughout. The main limitation is that there’s only a gentle tightening of pressure rather than a distinct structural turn or surprising complication.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc under an accumulative/causal lens: Mara enters with a goal, the sky’s pattern-break brings the constellations down, the goddess issues an ultimatum, and Mara’s rail-spike tactic reconfigures the situation. Causality is coherent—the spike’s remembered function motivates its use as a channel, and that choice leads to the fissure, the goddess’s pull, and the transformed echo “Stay.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: divinity shifts from quarry to interlocutor, and Mara’s role is reweighted. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible in her ongoing obligation to return “when patterns break themselves again.”

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: journalist’s call → journey to observatory → proof-by-contradiction experiment → resistance of the orbit → breaking the nib → transformed orbit and headline. The global drive reads as Hybrid (causal ritual plus accumulative reweighting of regret), and closure is a clear Decisive Change / Conceptual Repricing: regret’s orbit becomes cage-then-planet, with options and identity reconfigured. The ending funicular descent and printing-house shard extend, rather than dilute, the closure by showing concrete consequences of the ritual. World rules about stellar projection and rewriting microfiche are consistent enough within this fabulist frame not to disrupt causality.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: she comes to the lab to solve her guilt, tethers the amber, triggers the boy’s cry, confronts the firmware’s true nature, then makes a decisive menu choice. The menus provide a crisp structural spine and escalating decision points. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost—she foregoes the seemingly easier self-sacrificial options to free the insect/sound and live with quiet rather than obliteration. Structure is linear and legible, with no orientation debt or late rule-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: grotto ritual → silent realization → scattering → new drawing, all causally linked through her pursuit of meaning in mess. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: meaning reframed from stable shape to repeatable motion, with an earned cost in the wholesale acceptance of ephemerality. The two-shard structure (grotto, then plaza) is legible and the before/after is clear in how she now works with erasure instead of against it. Escalation is calm but real, through deepening hush and reconfiguration of the flake’s whispers into a single thesis-line that reweights all prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative design: present-tense mosaic work interleaved with tightly relevant memories of the fire, all converging on the construction of the “map of forgetting.” Causality holds—her past entrapment in retrocognition, the forty-nine days, and the plaza’s ruin all motivate her exact ritual and departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what mercy in memory means and chooses a new path, with clear before/after. The only limitation is that the external situation in the scene itself never materially shifts, so escalation is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly ritual → maze → orchard → Lila → weaving → transformed self, with each step causally and texturally building on the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the theater, the ghost, and time itself are reweighted, and the cost—Lila’s disappearance, the orchard dimming, his continued ghostliness—is legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the magic rules stay internally consistent. The only small limit is that the “price” of his new stasis remains somewhat gentle and could be shaded with sharper consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: static shock → activation of geode → deciphering patterns → invention of light shields → community sanctuary, with a legible before/after and a conceptual cost for society’s earlier pill hubris. Structure leans heavily on summary (“Working through the night…”, “As she helped dozens, then hundreds…”) skipping over any failed attempts or setbacks, which flattens escalation. Closure is present—Mira’s studio has transformed into a beacon, and her relationship to the geode and to the disaster has reconfigured—but it lands without a strong sense of sacrifice or narrowed options. Overall it’s coherent and publishable-level competent, not yet elite in its structural refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: emotion-mapping → anomaly (cold node) → contact with the fossil → vocal channeling → transformed staff and reconfigured world. Causality is tight within the lyric frame, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where her role and the cave’s function both shift. The cost is legible in her physical collapse and the implied self-erasure into rumor, though the “species-wide hibernation” and future rebirth are delivered more as conceptual frame than live clock pressure. Still, the before/after is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → cataloging → release of the echo → spiral patterning → resealing and departure, each step deepening the central drive. Closure lands as a conceptual re-pricing of the prophecy—future as thread and garment rather than a narrowing fate—with clear before/after in her stance and chosen role. Causality within the lyric frame holds: each act with the buttons and jar changes what meaning is available next. The cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the safety of a fixed prophecy for the burden of shared, ongoing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean and causal: cliff approach → decoding snow cipher → accessing the buried station → powering the transmitter → recording and sending the confession → exit into civilian crowd. The dominant drive—transmit the data and confession despite personal ruin—holds to the end, and the closure beat (pressing send and crushing the pillbox) lands with visible cost. The lack of active on-page opposition or complication keeps the escalation quieter than it could be, but the constraints of damaged tech, limited power, and time at least give a low-key situational pressure. The before/after of his stance is legible and charged without any causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival at the crossing, the mysterious fare, the threading, the passage, and the sandbar transformation form a coherent causal chain. The ticking gutters and “when the gutters stop… the crossing will sink” give a clear temporal hinge that pays off exactly when the coach is abandoned. Closure lands as a conceptual and situational reconfiguration: the river becomes a hill, the coachman’s role is foreclosed, and his inner drive is redefined. The drive lens (accumulative/lyric with causal beats) is stable and the cost—loss of his old world—is clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: summoned by the thrum, Lin locates the tree, performs the clay/lantern ritual, reweaves time, then passes the charge on to the child. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant of kindness-as-memory traveling forward through lantern glass and fruit, with the oasis remaining liminally alive. Causality within the chosen mode holds—each new act (clay hive, aligning reflections) meaningfully follows from the last. The only minor limitation is that Lin’s initial objective is more implied than explicitly framed as a question that the ending re-answers.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: stolen tool → opened lock → boy brought to the rooftop → transformed return down the stairs. The story lands strong closure via a resonant reconfiguration: the boy descends changed, “carrying inside him a small reflected moon,” and the tooth’s fall plus the petal’s dissolution mark irreversible shifts. Stakes around the boy’s confinement are more atmospheric than concretely tested—no direct opposition appears once she decides to act—so escalation feels gentle rather than pressurized. Structure is otherwise tight, with no dangling setups and a satisfying echo between opening and ending rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal and situational throughline is clear: awakening → protocol-following → encounter with the hum → offered possession → refusal → codex/letter → new rhythm. Closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she forecloses shared-memory possession in favor of a consciously embraced solitude that has been redefined. Every major beat follows logically from the last, with no rule-breaking conveniences. The only thing holding this just shy of exceptional is that external stakes remain relatively contained to her psyche rather than broader consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival at the temple → ritual with the twig and thread → dispersal of past letters → embodied reclamation → outward re-entry. Causality within the magical logic holds: placing the twig triggers the weaving, which releases the letters and enables her realization and lightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a new stance (“I am here”) and the world’s answer, with the temple returning to secrecy as a counterpoint. Stakes and cost stay somewhat internal and quiet, but the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival → setup keyed to a precise celestial window → initial probe → countermove → antagonist adaptation → riskier, less certain tactic → partial, time-boxed victory and decompression. The ticking-clock structure around 02:17 and the streaming images of the town give clear stakes and a temporal frame that narrows options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tricksters retreat for this orbit, the town’s violence pauses, and Lyra accepts that what she’s won is an interval, not salvation, with that cost legible in “power plays merely paused.” The only thing holding this just shy of exceptional is that the “price” remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in a specific loss or irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is clean and causal: clue → nexus → organ/spatial mutiny → shaft → mirror chamber → bargain with cost. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who/where/when and what she wants) and the surreal twists build logically from the “echoes mutiny” premise. Closure is strong: acquiring the key decisively changes the world’s options (tunnels close, archives can be opened) and Arin’s stance, with the loss of the junction and her phobia’s burial as the price. Nothing important is resolved by coincidence; even the impossible organ is a sustained device rather than a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight: a single night at the quarry proceeds from entry, ritual setup, discovery of the hair, blood-binding, recovered memory, portrait, then handoff to the detective, with clear because/therefore causality. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the cold case conceptually reweights into “evidence that doesn’t burn” and the city’s future behavior, with visible cost in Juniper reopening traumatic memory. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the opening and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds throughout. A slight limitation is that institutional consequences are gestured at rather than dramatized, though for this length it still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: exile → journals → cipher → map → confrontation with Voss → dirigible salvage → evidence → appeal/choice to stay, and closure clearly reconfigures the premise of “reversible exile” with a felt cost. The hybrid causal/accumulative structure is legible and holds, and the orientation (where/when/who) is strong from the first sentence. The main soft spot is how smoothly later beats resolve—Voss’s quick cooperation, the straightforward recovery, and the Ministry’s near-instant capitulation slightly undercut the sense of hard-won victory. Still, the final choice and conceptual repricing of exile read earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: music → activation of the flake → doorway → reconstructed hitchhiker → step onto the unfinished bridge. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s rule-set (never vs maybe) is visibly rewritten at the cost of leaving her prior reality. Causality remains intuitive within magical-realism terms; nothing vital feels arbitrary. The one limitation is that the “rules” of the doorway/bridge remain impressionistic, so the exact price is more inferred than explicitly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: Jonah returns to the train with his fixed ritual, Mara’s arrival complicates and deepens it, and their joint act of burning shirts and parting ways resolves the underlying question of whether he’ll keep circling the same path. Causality is coherent—each move (laying out notes, Mara recognizing the ritual, building the spiral, then burning) flows as a “therefore” rather than an “and then.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Jonah’s decision to walk away differently, symbolized by giving up one note and not looking back, marks a clear before/after. Stakes and cost are conceptual rather than plot-heavy, but scaled well for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → setup with star and telegram → vision of the temple → spoken activation → shared witnessing → reconfiguration and return. Causality is legible (the telegram and star-pointing lead to the vision; spoken syllables trigger the temple’s response; applying the telegram heals the telescope), and the closure—carrying grief differently and broadcasting the new inscription—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure very early, and the hybrid observatory/desert overlay is managed clearly. The only limitation is that the “race” against the variable star’s dimming never manifests as a true structural constraint, so pressure feels more fated than contingent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: failed mirror trick → guilt and unresolved confession → journey into the vortex → methodical circles → forced, on-site confession → reconfiguration of the lake/orchard. The expanding circles provide a clear structural spine and escalation device, while the flesh-eating seed adds a persistent constraint that pays off at closure. The ending delivers a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis: she has confessed and is half-bound, half-spared, expelled rather than redeemed. No orientation debt: who/where/why is clear early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and accumulative under a lyric/causal hybrid lens: each step (glade → scars as channel → hedge appearing → maze visions → covenant choice) logically intensifies toward the final graft. Orientation is clear early on: we know where, who, and the temporal strangeness by the second paragraph, and the experimental worldbuilding stays internally consistent. Closure is an on-page decisive change and earned stasis—the narrator literally becomes the gate, foreclosing the option of leaving with a clear price. The before/after is unmistakable and thematically charged, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal throughline is clean: seek soul repair → travel to orchard → forced barter choice → unforeseen cost → reconfigured understanding of what “patching” means. The story lands a resonant reconfiguration at the end, with a visible price (lost memory, Lira’s hollowing, the planted star-sprout) and a clear before/after stance. Orientation and world rules are legible from early on, and the orchard’s ledger concept pays off structurally and thematically. The only slight limit is that the exit from the orchard and transition into the city reads more as a graceful diminuendo than a further tightening of consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: public failure → contract loss → trip to return deposit → discovery of the envelope → mic repair → quarry-wide echo → new archival job. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric surface, and the closure (reconfigured purpose) lands clearly on the page. The cost—abandoning the fantasy of a return to stage life in favor of a humbler archival role—is legible. Structure is tight and well-contained for this length, with backstory snippets all anchored in present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene: arrival on the arbor → planting and attempted activation → successful sprouting and contact → reestablishment of the archive and conceptual reframing. Causality holds at each step (sentence → heat → glyphs → sprout → voice → new plank), and the closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing of “haunted ambitions” under a coherent magical logic. Stakes and drive—reconnection and understanding transition—remain unified throughout. The conflict stays mostly internal and metaphysical, which is intentional but keeps the sense of jeopardy somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: the drive lens is textural, building from tending identities → smelting them into a ribbon → planting the creel so the archive remembers when she cannot, culminating in a charged poise at the “still point where every story agrees to be unfinished.” Causality is dreamlike but consistent within its rules, and the closure offers a clear before/after: the archive is now rooted, and her future role is reconfigured under that constraint. The time motif (“after tomorrow disappears and before yesterday returns,” the moon darkening) gives a gentle but real ticking clock that narrows her window of action. The cost—her acceptance that she will forget her purpose while the building remembers—lands conceptually, though it could be pressed a little harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: descent → discovery of the door → spiral of confessions → mirror/crown chamber → transformation, with each step deepening the same pressure. Causality is coherent (pearl responds to stone, confessions reveal the builders’ fate, crown and pearl together trigger the shift), and the closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost—Mara effectively leaves her old life to become part of the cave. The before/after is legible and conceptually expensive. Minor limitation: the external doomsday frame and the convoy’s search feel more like atmospheric bookends than active structural constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival → graffiti clue → discovery of stairs → tunnel and stream → ritual with accordion → ascent and reframed map. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each action naturally triggering the next, and the descent/return shape gives strong coherence. Closure is on the page with cost: she sacrifices the accordion and emerges with a redefined relationship to her past and her medication. Nothing vital is left dangling, and the exploratory premise is contained effectively within this one continuous episode.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative descent into the library’s core, with each beat (cipher fragments, heavier watch, dimming shelves) tightening toward the realization that she is meant to become the library. Causality is more conceptual than physical, but still coherent (“through propagation delays” she maps echoes → reaches the heart → hears the library breathing → reprices her goal). Closure is strong: the decisive change is her choice to undo the golden thread, reconfiguring the premise so that she becomes the library’s tongue. The only notable weakness is that the nine-hour clock and “doors sealing” are introduced but never meaningfully tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Lira brings the violin → consults coffee-stain divination → learns the origin and potential catastrophe → faces a time-constrained moral decision → plays, triggering world-scale consequences. The piece holds a single, coherent drive—will she use the violin to end imperial summer—and closure lands decisively with cost on the page (failed harvests, dynastic fall, her own exhaustion). Worldbuilding devices like coffee-reading and telepathic plants serve the plot rather than derailing it. The convenience of acquiring near-total historical insight from one divination is a slight softness but acceptable for the mode and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative ritual: preparation → infusion → revelation → surrender, with each beat causally following the last. Orientation is strong from the start (who she is, what the grotto is, what the chip means). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive change: she becomes the vessel and disperses, with the cost (her life/identity) unambiguously on the page. The brief morning-after shard with the empty studio and surviving chip neatly seals the arc without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is strong and legible: forgiveness triggers the climb, which births the boy, which leads to the vision, the hairpin sacrifice, the internalized relic, and finally the return and release of debts. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the valley’s economy shifts from counting debts to counting heartbeats, and the cycle of rebirth persists but with altered terms. Each step feels like a “therefore” rather than an “and then,” and the years-later coda pays off the cycle premise. Cost—the boy’s death, her renunciation of escape—is on-page and thematically integral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: chime-by-chime decoding leads to the cracked brass bell’s message, then to the shard confrontation, then to the dawn reconfiguration. Causality is legible under a textural lens: their encoded doubts → her mapping → the final moral offer → the group’s stance shift toward “maybe.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost: they relinquish the comfort of certainty and accept grief and risk. No orientation issues; the single overnight scene is coherent and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: lifelong research → secret grotto → final lesson → stone drop → ringed revelations → Marcus’s conceptual shift and implied future. The single continuous scene with embedded glimpses of other times is structurally elegant, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of vanishing/appearing) lands clearly with cost. Some beats feel pre-ordained rather than pressured—Marcus has little real option but to receive the lesson—but the design still coheres. Overall, it’s structurally sound, with a lucid before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: arrival at the canyon, recognition of resonance, activation of song, and the merging of arrowhead and self, all building toward a single reconfiguration. Causality is soft but coherent—each move (“he began to sing,” the birds forming an arrow, pressing the stone to his chest) follows from what’s been established. Closure is strong: he becomes the echo/compass, and the wandering pulse is explicitly re-situated as his own heartbeat and as part of the canyon. There are no orientation or lens issues; the piece consistently operates under an accumulative/textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: balcony discontent → discovery of the folly/keystone → risky mist descent under algorithmic threat → ethical fork with the keystone → badge sacrifice and self-exile, with servers logging the loss as “rounding error.” The structure holds as a single continuous scene with one deepening turn (algorithms sealing the air) and one decisive choice around the keystone. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: he forecloses the guild path and redefines “luminance” as something to be hidden and internalized. The only slight limit is that external consequences remain mostly implied rather than directly dramatized beyond the logging coda.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: encounter on the pier → key → wreck → safe → recording → return to the lamps, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Jin’s understanding of sound and light is reconfigured and his role as lamplighter is transformed. The cost is quiet but present: he risks himself and the fragile archive to pursue this revelation. Stakes remain modest and contemplative rather than sharply pressured, which keeps this just shy of elite-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure holds cleanly as an accumulative single-scene ritual: coins warm → lots are cast → spiral arrangement → wave-surfing experience → realization that sacrifice is the distillate → ingestion and chrysalis. Causality is coherent under a lyric, accumulative lens, and the closure—Lira becoming the universe’s antenna with visible cost—is on the page and legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost despite abstract diction. The only limit is that the middle pressure ramp (from listening to becoming waveform) is more experiential than decision-driven, slightly muting the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clean by the second sentence (who/where/why), and the piece follows a coherent accumulative-causal arc: observatory → star-sentences → moral revelation → act of release → altered exit. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he learns every death has extended his own existence and then changes his stance by freeing voices and walking on “borrowed” starlight. Each major fantastical effect arises from a prior choice (touching the ink, breaking the cylinders, using the atlas), so the pattern feels internally logical. The structure is tight for the length with no unresolved set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: bell hung → first drip → accelerating drip → seven-day vigil → lifetime of ritual → posthumous legacy, with no causality breaks. The closure—Kael’s death, the bell cracking, and the ongoing ocean sustained by communal counting and the epitaph drip—is a clear resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (his life, replaced by distributed faith). The time progression from days to years is compressed but legible and purposeful, serving the mythic frame rather than feeling like summary. Stakes (the return of the sea as tied to belief) are introduced early and carried through to the final image without dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a night patrol descends into the Swan, follows a literal trail of photographs, reaches a revelatory Polaroid, and returns to the ridge with a reconfigured mission. Causality is tight enough—each discovery leads to the next—and the closure (her new stance and practice of documenting the town) lands with emotional and conceptual cost. The only limit is that the external “souvenir diver” stake largely stays notional, keeping the on-page pressure predominantly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival at the orchard → search for the crystal → revelation via fire → fusion at the end, with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/RR: her stance toward logic vs. awe is reconfigured with a real (if mostly conceptual) risk of “unravel[ing] the seam between knowable and known.” The “final transformation” remains abstract, and the threat to the world never concretely manifests beyond atmospheric hints, which slightly blunts perceived cost. Orientation and sequence are lucid throughout; there are no causality breaks or confusing jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: watch → anomaly → recognition of stolen signal → uncanny doubling → test and handoff, with each step narrowing her options. Causality is surreal but coherent within the piece’s rules, and the drive lens (situational/accumulative) holds through closure. The decisive change—redefining her role and relinquishing the buckle—lands clearly with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clear: the duplicated guardianship → ritual using the DUPLICATE brain → escalating confessions → the rewrite bell → the decision to synthesize rather than let one be erased. The dominant drive lens reads as causal with a situational overlay (impending rewrite as a clock), and closure is strong: both contenders surrender their separate existence to create a new guardian, with existential cost on the page. There are no orientation issues; the dojo, jar, and rewrite mechanics are taught early and pay off cleanly. The only minor limitation is that the pivot to mutual synthesis feels slightly swift compared to the depth of the setup, leaving a hint of untapped resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: ominous envelope → planting deadline → architectural transformation → retooled puzzles → guests unknowingly complete the cycle, leading to a conceptual repricing of the haven. The Global Drive Lens reads Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyric pattern), and closure lands via the realization that the true “seed mail” is the self-writing labyrinth, with the price being Mira’s surrender of total authorial control. Yet the threat that “the rooms will never let anyone leave” dissolves rather quickly once she cooperates with the seed, with no real test of failure or near-miss, softening the sense of cost. Structure (single continuous arc) is tight and legible, but the final beat leans on explanation (“had never been about the corpse flower at all”) instead of letting image alone carry the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and clean: hourglass empties → silence and long-term grief → deliberate experiment with sound in the tunnel → unexpected “return” of laughter → reconfigured home at the end. Causality is clear and accumulative under a textural lens: each sound experiment reshapes the emotional field rather than producing a literal ghost. Closure lands as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration—the house, marriage, and Ellery’s grief-state all feel different by the final paragraph, with cost intact. No orientation or lens ambiguities undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story runs on an accumulative/lyric drive with clean orientation and a single, continuous situation: nightly visits to the boundary of light. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses to cross, gives up the pendant, and returns changed only in stance, wearing an “expanded boundary of light” as cost and gain. Causality is coherent at the lyric level (waiting instead of forcing, the pendant’s behavior, the garden’s rearrangement), and there is a clear before/after in her relationship to uncertainty and the threshold. The cost—remaining homesick and alone while deepening her bond with uncertainty—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is tight: theft → prepared nexus → blood and ash ritual → crozier’s transformation → creature’s revelation → choice to sacrifice his sight → sealed nexus, with no teleporting logic. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (causal ritual plus accumulative imagery), and closure lands as a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: he becomes a different kind of “custodian” at visible cost. The global drive (creative destruction vs creed) holds consistently through to the valley-ward walk. A slight limitation is that the external stakes for the valley and bishopric remain mostly implied rather than put under direct on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the shard, preparation/tuning, conceptual revaluation, and release. Causality is consistent (her experiments and assumptions lead to the revelation that the shard is a cocoon), and the ending delivers a clear conceptual repricing with a visible cost (sacrificing the star fragment, relinquishing prior conclusions). The dominant drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and it holds through closure. The stakes remain more conceptual than situational, which slightly mutes the felt cost relative to the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal line is strong: discovery of coordinates → radio contact with his past self → realization of the hourglass’s price → decision to flip and then re-flip it while steering via the barnacle patterns. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the “sideways clocks/vanishing ferry” rule-set is consistent enough to support the climax. Closure lands as a decisive change: the ferry becomes fully real, the hourglass is spent, and Arden’s world reconfigures around a single, coherent tomorrow with a conceptual cost. The one slight softness is the abstractness of what, concretely, is lost in the merge; the “one timeline must be poured into the other” price is emotionally legible but not fully dramatized in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: entrance → mapping → gallery awakening → identity/connection revelation → exit. Dream logic is consistent and escalates cleanly, with each beat intensifying the same drive rather than wandering. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she shifts from mapping connection to understanding she is the connective tissue, with cost legible in the emptied spool and dissolution of the composite man. Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, but the before/after is clear and the pattern is taught and honored.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure—classroom scene then ascent to the spire—tracks cleanly, with each step causally flowing from the previous (lesson → boy’s question → private instruction → transfer of the link). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Situational: pressure builds through layered images and choices rather than sharp plot twists. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: navigation is repriced as “refusing to disappear,” and the missing link becomes a charged void. Cost is legible in the loss of the relic and the emotional risk of hope under an unchanged external situation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: obituary → pulses → photograph → ledger → upload → confrontation → public reattribution, all driving toward the single throughline of restoring Lila’s credit. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the Heart-Trace program and Hask’s narrative are reweighted, and Mira’s role transitions from tracer to custodian of a more honest record. Stakes and options narrow cleanly at the archive door and koi pond, where her choice between physical evidence and digital proof matters. Hask’s collapse via moral rather than physical force is slightly compressed but still causally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: gold fleck → phase transition → descent through altered facility → encounter with each technician → Voss-held circuit → collective return and banishment of the signal. The structure is essentially one continuous, escalating passage with a clear before/after and an on-page price (she survives but carries the obligation to remember). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the facility yields back its dead and then willingly recedes, while Mara leaves with reweighted responsibility. Nothing vital feels under-explained or retrofitted, and orientation is solid from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: clerical typo → digital haunting → ink-mapping ritual → re-embodiment → confrontation with clerk → departure into uncertain dawn. Backstory is woven tightly into present action and never stalls momentum, and the “before dawn” correction forms a quiet but real clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes both his own survival and the clerk’s error, with the cost of surrendering his ghostly refuge. The hybrid causal/accumulative design holds consistently and the ending’s options and price are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: desert crossing → descent into the tunnel → ritual activation → bodily sacrifice → transformed world, all causally linked. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear Decisive Change at the end (she becomes statue/heart; the language becomes self-sustaining). Stakes and cost are legible on the page, and there is no orientation debt; who/where/what is happening is clear from early on. The closure reconfigures the initial problem (language death) into an ongoing, costly solution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story tracks cleanly from investigation in the underground garden through progressive supernatural intrusions to rooftop metamorphosis; cause-and-effect (phone → arrowhead → bruise → vines → cryptid → fusion) holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is decisive: Mara’s transformation and joining the chorus is an on-page before/after shift with conceptual cost (loss of individuality/humanity) even if she experiences it as gain. The structure is linear and contained, with no orientation problems and one coherent drive. The only slight weakness is that the “deliver the flint to the sky” imperative feels a bit convenient as a directive rather than emerging from a sharper dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Calla crosses the bridge, uses the gardener’s rhythm to neutralize the statues, retrieves and fuses the seed with the shell, and thereby transforms the orchard and world-pattern. Closure is a strong resonant reconfiguration: the orchard de-mechanizes, the bridge dissolves, and the rhythm diffuses into the iron cities with a clear before/after. Cost is present but conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized—she becomes absence and rumor more than a figure paying a visible price. Structure is tight and continuous, with the brief epilogue extending the outcome rather than feeling like an afterthought.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong and legible: storm → console activation → key → tunnel → mailbox → trade → rain and distributed letters, with no orientation confusion. The piece delivers on closure through a decisive trade (storm for letters) and a reconfigured world-state (illegal promises suddenly delivered), with a clear before/after. The border, drone, and contraband premise stay consistent, and the mailbox payoff honors early hints about eaten stamps and broken promises. The main structural weakness is the relative ease of execution—few genuine setbacks or reversals—so the arc reads smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: search → wrong turn → oasis → halo contact → singing → departure, with each beat deepening the central drive of revaluing silence. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the halo’s power is redefined (it reveals existing melodies), sinks into him, and the world is subtly altered (glowing train, musical rails) at a visible conceptual cost—he abandons his old stance and anonymity for a lifelong, uncertain listening. Causality is intact and legible even in lyric mode; nothing important teleports or resets. The only restraint is that the external stakes remain quite inward-facing, but for this length and lens they feel sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: her movement deeper into the hyperbolic stacks steadily reconfigures her understanding, culminating in a clear conceptual before/after about where stories live and her function as observer. Causality is soft but legible—scarf warmth → deeper exploration → metaphysical revelation → quiet return with altered stance. Closure (a conceptual repricing of inspiration and authorship) lands cleanly, though largely at an intellectual level. The lack of concrete obstacles or reversals keeps the structural tension moderate rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: set-up of librarian and dream → method (palette and camera) → outward journey → sunrise corridor → capture → transformed library. Causality holds under a lyric, near-mythic logic; each step (“each snap inhaling...exhaling a letter of the cipher”) concretely advances the central goal. Closure is strong: the world’s rules visibly reconfigure (films vanish, shelves pulse, voices return) and Mireya’s status shifts from private seeker to custodian of communal longing, with the cost written onto her skin. The only slight limitation is that the risk of losing an unnamed memory remains conceptual rather than fully dramatized at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival → star’s hint → gate choice → corridor → mirror → breaking it → transformed return and epilogue of consequences. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone; each step deepens the core premise rather than meandering. Closure is strong: a decisive act produces a clear before/after state with an ongoing price (the lost name, the scar, the propagated ability in children). Structure is linear and legible, with no orientation debt or late rule-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: return to site → investigation of ring and bruised cap → discovery of sextant → conceptual reframe of “theft” → decisive cut and tincture → memories return → reconfigured stance at the hilltop. The structure is essentially one continuous, well-contained scene with a brief, clear-timeskip coda, and closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing. Stakes and options narrow coherently at the moment she’s urged to “complete the exchange,” and her refusal directly produces the greenhouse’s shuddering transformation. The only slight softness is how smoothly the mushroom cutting restores memories; a touch more resistance or unpredictability there would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern quickly and sustains it: tea-leaf prophecy → ritual around the cup → library’s shudder and mentor-name page → arrival of the child → reconfigured exile loop. Causality is clear enough for this mode (her actions with the cup and clauses provoke the shudder and page; the leaves accurately foreshadow the reader and stakes), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the rules of exile are conceptually repriced. Cost is legible: Lira remains in exile, holding memory and burden so the child can go home intact. A hair more explicit causal linkage between the ritual and the law-change might strengthen it, but the current ambiguity feels intentional, not sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: Arin builds the loom to capture fleeing color, escalates to ritualized capture, then faces the widening veil and chooses dissemination over containment, leading to the loom’s collapse and his transformed role. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong accumulative-textural overlay; each step follows from the prior one and raises the stakes from orchard survival to world-level wonder. Closure is solidly on the page: the sapling, Arin’s new vocation, and the annual bridge memory articulate a decisive before/after with conceptual and personal cost (loss of orchard, sudden aging, relinquishing control). The piece keeps temporal and spatial anchors clear and pays off all major set-ups (seed, loom, veil, tools) without dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain—Elian enters the sanctuary, applies his mentor’s teaching, unravels the net, the spirit coalesces and is freed—is clean and accumulative, with each knot release advancing both plot and emotional stakes. The structure is a single, coherent scene with a clear before/after: humming masks and suffocating silence versus singing masks and lifted hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elian’s understanding of his role and of “broken” things shifts in direct response to the ritual. The cost is subtle but present in the emotional and existential weight of his new calling rather than any external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arriving at the vault, comparing footage, aligning the map tear with the henge shadow, then crossing the threshold and accepting a new stance toward the unknown. Causality holds under a lyric, conceptual lens; each step follows from the prior discovery or realization, and the closure—her emergent role as “witness to the seam”—lands as a clear conceptual repricing with cost. The chapel’s opening rule (responding to matched stillness rather than force) ties prior beats together coherently. The single continuous scene with embedded time echoes (1984 vs. now) is easy to follow and uses its brevity well.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece is a clean single-scene arc with a clear before/after: Mara arrives determined to solve grief as physics and leaves having re-priced it as narrative and contract, marked by the concrete act of releasing the plane. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the snow globe’s refusal to behave, Elias’s comment, the 1914 recognition, and her final written line all build one chain of escalation. Closure is strong—a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (abandoning the notebook to dissolve, surfacing alone, Elias forgetting her brother’s name). There are no orientation issues, but the internal turn around the 1914 realization is a bit compressed relative to its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → painting → echo confrontation → activation of the code → release and descent. Causality within the lyric frame holds: the act of encoding awakens the “ghost in code,” which forces Lyra to reconceive her project and release the petals. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward unspoken needs (imprison vs. release) visibly changes, and the descent to the city marks a legible before/after. Stakes and costs are more conceptual/emotional than situationally sharp, but they are present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the goggles → cipher → diary → map → seed → descent and planting, with each development narrowing Lira’s options from passive observer to active inheritor of the captain’s wager. The structure is a single through-line with a clear before/after: she begins compelled upward by duty and ends choosing to remain below in a new, self-authored role. Closure carries cost and clarity (she is no longer functioning as a conventional servant, and the captain’s “suicide” is recontextualized), and nothing vital feels unkept. One could argue for slightly more on-page consequence for abandoning her duties, but the piece reads complete and legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tight: the fraying cable, memory-filament, and log entries build toward a clear closure in which Mara finishes the recording and leaves the gondola. Causality under this lens holds—each physical beat (groaning cable, releasing kites, final snap) coherently tightens pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the telescope falling as a “star” proves the mother’s belief and reweights clouds/empty space as archives with cost (Mara’s implied death). A slight softness is that the physical logistics of “not falling but floating” and the exact fate of her body are lyrical rather than concrete, which may distance the emotional cost a hair for a very demanding market.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: coin and note → realization about what to paint → timed painting sequence → siren countdown → finished work and departure. The accumulative/textural drive works: each beat layers more about her perception, the guild’s intentions, and the library’s impending loss, culminating in the conceptual repricing that she has been painting her own “face” in negative space. Closure is strong and legible—the library will fall, but the work and her reframed identity remain—though the emotional and practical cost of leaving the sanctuary could be more sharply dramatized. Causality is solid, with no major orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: dimming lamps → Lira’s exploratory wandering → discovery/translation of hopscotch patterns → story-fueled light-feed → social and navigational reorientation. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the single throughline never tangles. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship relit, a new passage named, and Lira repositioned within the crew. The main softness is that the solution arrives on the first try without setback, so the sense of risk compresses quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecy → journey to library → failed gear test → realization about “better drafts” in mirrors → key repair → opening the lock → irrevocable passage into the workshop. Closure lands firmly as both a Decisive Change (he cannot go back; the door vanishes) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (his role and relationship to failure are redefined). The cost is apparent: he trades his old world and familiar grief for a binding custodial role tied to eclipses. The only hairline slip is how quickly the hall’s metaphysical rule (“stored better versions”) is inferred and mastered, which feels slightly expository compared to the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failing arches → need for coordinated harvest → Mara’s messaging method → community mobilization → successful harvest → Mara’s release. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, but because/therefore linkages remain intact and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration plus Conceptual Repricing (her becoming the nebula). The time pressure of the coming eclipse is clear, and the harvest sequence pays off earlier set-ups (chalk, ladders, bell, trust). The only thing holding it below 9+ is that the danger and potential for failure never quite bite hard enough on the page—success feels assured once the pattern takes hold.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is tight and accumulative: we move from arrival → discovery → understanding the method → executing it → accepting the bargain, with each step causally preparing the next. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the clock is pulled back, the world continues, and she is transformed into the pane’s ghost-mirror at real cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with clear causal spine) is stable, and the lighthouse scene is continuous despite temporal/lifetime expansions. No major orientation issues; the complex metaphysics still read legibly by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: curse/orchard → travelers in maze → ticking frost clock → birds’ threat → blueprint nut → warmth-impressions → final fork decision → safe exit vs renewed imprisonment. Single-scene structure with a clear time pressure supports a satisfying closure where the dominant stake (saving them before frost) is resolved at a cost. The closure image of fossilized handprints and the walk back to the orchard delivers a strong Resonant Reconfiguration without loose threads. There are no orientation issues or contrived late abilities; rules are established before they matter.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clear and coherent: ravine epiphany → lab realization and making → return to ravine for installation, with each step causally following from the last. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal chain of insight and construction is intact and satisfying. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the ravine becomes an “instrument” and Mara walks away, having converted private grief into an ongoing communal experience with emotional cost. A hairline reason it doesn’t quite reach 9+ is that escalation is more implied than structurally stressed; the “weeks later” jump slightly diffuses immediacy even as it works thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story uses an accumulative, lyric structure that holds: each transaction with moonlight and absence incrementally redefines what the library is and leads coherently to the vendor’s self-erasure. Causality at the conceptual level is clean (“because she incises and bottles absence, the library tilts toward becoming a seed crystal world”), and the closure—a decisive change where she becomes the door-outline—is legible with a before/after. There’s no orientation debt: who/where/what is clear early despite the surrealism. The only limitation is that stakes remain largely macro-conceptual rather than dramatized through one pressing, personal dilemma, so the climax feels coolly elegant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: dream-calling → courtyard reading → descent → overwhelming contact → reversal of her gift → altered return. Orientation is strong from the opening; who/where/what she can do are legible early, and the descent provides a natural tightening. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in her ability and in her understanding of what “cleaning” grief should mean, with the land’s future gardens as conceptual cost/aftermath. There are no dropped setups or convenience fixes; the piece stays focused on one throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: problem (broken weight, silent elevator) → descent to language drawers → mechanical repair → spiritual/linguistic bridge-building → duet and communal repercussion. Causality holds under a lyric, slightly fairy-tale logic, and the “before/after” is legible: isolated, hoarse systems become harmonized infrastructure with social consequence. Closure is strong via Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the final roadway of resonance and wheat that “remember[s] the music of its becoming” clearly reweights the world. The only limitation is that resistance is minimal, so turns feel like graceful steps rather than pressured gambits.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: preparation → activation → overreach and collapse → aftermath, with each move causally linked (helmet design, moon at zenith, entanglement, then loss as the angle breaks). Orientation is immediate and solid; the canyon, the corporate backstory, and the constraints of the device are all clear without stalling. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she fails at her stated task this round, loses the mirror, but gains illicit sketches and a refined resolve. The cost is legible on the page (burned-out tool, blood, aborted engines) and the before/after in her options and knowledge reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: gravity inversion → entry → navigating kernels → accessing combinations → restoring the Archive → narrow escape. The time constraint and inversion logic are consistently tracked (e.g., twenty-ninth minute, fifteen minutes left, snap-back at the end). Closure is solidly on-page: the Archive’s memory is restored, the doodle is spent, and the grotto seals, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the danger from the seeds of vigilance never fully materializes into a near-failure, so cost and crisis feel a notch under maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: each action (listening, mapping, strumming) deepens the charged silence until the grove’s partial reawakening. Causality is clean—her analysis of cracks leads directly to the tuned strumming that elicits the statue’s voice and the insulator’s new charge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules remain, but the valley has shifted from dead silence to fragile, relational “conversation,” with tomorrow’s wire waiting. The cost is legible in Ilay’s trembling restraint and the sense of how long the valley has been mute, even if material stakes stay small-scale and intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is coherent as an accumulative, lyric meditation that builds from exile → nexus encounter → revaluation → new mission. Causality is soft but legible under that lens: because he was exiled, he seeks the nexus; because he “correlates” the silence, he arrives at a decision to act beyond the academy. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his exile and role (“not an ending but a transposition”), with a before/after that’s emotionally clear. The main limitation is that stakes and consequences remain abstractly global (“teach the world”) with no concrete obstacle or narrowing of options on the page, which blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: enter workshop → seek clasp → tune successive silences → reach forgiveness → reprice the clasp and leave it broadcasting. The drive lens is textural/accumulative, and the pressure of approaching fireworks provides a subtle but coherent clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the clasp’s function redefined and Mirelle’s relationship to memory and silence altered, with the cost of relinquishing control over what’s “locked.” All beats link logically with no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: testing the seed → climb and ritual graft → overnight bloom → dawn renunciation. Causality within the lyric mode holds: sensory cues and traditions drive each step rather than arbitrary mystical events, and the closure (leaving the journal for the wind-spirits and descending toward the tide) reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with an earned before/after. The dominant stake—how to act in “serenity within motion” without disturbing the forest’s pulse—tightens once at the grafting scene and resolves in her internal shift from ambition to companionship with serenity. Cost is legible in the surrender of her private record and her prior ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: approach → contact with the arrow/echoes → gravity inversion and accelerated growth → sapling revelation → return, all in a single continuous window. Causality holds tightly, with the inversion hour and the arrow tip driving each subsequent phase rather than arbitrary turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reconceives resilience as a collective echo and leaves as a “keeper,” with the world visibly altered around her. The cost—her memories drawn into the sapling—is on the page, though its sting is softened by the serenity of the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: survey → vector convergence → glass plaza → predictive echo → reconfigured exit, with each step causally emerging from the last. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: Mara gains a concrete method of foresight at the cost of relinquishing her token and accepting ongoing responsibility. The logic of the port “flipped inside out” and sound stored as predictive echo is strange but coherent within the taught pattern. The stakes are more intellectual and systemic than dramatized in a concrete dilemma, which slightly softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, quest-like structure is clean: he enters the cavern, passes successive tests (Echoless Vein, piano-slab, sculpted hush), and returns to the surface transformed, with a clear before/after in his relationship to wonder and the Council. Causality within the symbolic logic is coherent, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where he becomes the “living document” of wonder—is firmly on the page. What holds this below the very top tier is that failure never feels truly possible; obstacles are evocative but not structurally threatening, so the cost at closure reads more conceptual than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → descent with markers → re-encounter with the seam → mirror confrontation → renunciation, all causally and texturally linked. The closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she chooses not to step through but to lay down the flute, reweighting guardianship as inner hush rather than object-possession. Backstory about the prior failed playing is efficiently woven and directly motivates the present attempt to “harvest insights from failure.” Every beat follows logically; there are no orientation or causality gaps, and the cost is on the page when she relinquishes the relic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: halo fragment → unexpected sentence → destabilized self → borrowing the astronomer → superposition crisis → choice to reverse the press at the cost of all borrowed selves. This produces a clear before/after: a man defined by others’ personalities becomes a faint first edition of himself under a restored sky, with the stars and halo paying off as consequences of his act. Closure lands on-page with cost (the loss of all internal companions and his terrifying blankness) and the logic of the world’s rules holds under its own fabular premises. The accumulative lyric texture enhances rather than obscures the causal throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: pendant vibrates → stranger appears → revelation about Corwin and Elias → Elias steps into myth. Structure is a single continuous scene with one small retrospective shard (villagers later), and orientation is excellent from the first line. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/decisive change—Elias shifts from courier to message, with the ridgeway reframed as a seam between reality and legend. The cost of that change (loss of ordinary life and identity) is present but somewhat idealized, making the price feel a bit soft for elite-caliber impact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual whose steps accumulate pressure: approach → touch → lies → visions → admission → departure. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each move with the prism and frost deepens the communion and narrows his emotional options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines the car as reliquary rather than prison and leaves part of his grief behind at concrete cost (fractured, surrendered prism). No orientation issues or unkept setups; the arc is tight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: odd silence → discovery of box → assembling puzzle → realization of bargain → swallowing the bead and losing her voice → orchard’s rewinding stasis. The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric lens but still delivers an on-page decisive change with clear cost and an earned, resonant final image. Set-ups (amber bead, raveling silence, puzzle, loom) are all paid off and integrated into the closure. There are no orientation issues and no late rule-changes that undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/causal arc: silk arrives → mine shafts discovered → shafts reinforced → ladder built → arches lowered → social/occupational reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Cerulia’s physical and social order change on the page, and Thistle’s role is visibly altered. The cost of bartering away understanding is asserted early but never re-tested in a pressure scene, making the price of the transformation somewhat abstract. Still, the build from private experiment to communal bridge is structurally solid and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: shard activation → loom of bays → locker discovery → truth revelation → new vow, with each because/therefore linkage clear under a lyric frame. The closure unit is strong: she redefines her mapping practice in direct response to discovered complicity, with visible cost. The multiverse “bays” are variations on a single charged site, so the mosaic remains unified rather than diffuse. The conspiracy explanation (“maps, sold to distant militaries, funded the cover-up”) verges on compressed info-dump but does not break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: long-established ritual → anomaly (lamp dies early) → fear of keeper’s death → confirming sign she’s alive → reconfigured but enduring pattern at the end. Closure lands via a Charged Poise: the final image of him rowing away, sea glass warm in his palm, after hearing the stone click, reweights the entire chain with cost (ongoing solitude and responsibility). Causality is subtle but firm—because the lamp dies early, he comes now; because of their stone language, he can read that she endures and still asks. Backstory is anchored in present stimuli and never muddies orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: established routine → prophetic disruption → lighthouse’s transformation into a ship → navigation toward the blank canvas → dissolution into a new order. Causality holds within the lyric logic (each laugh and wick-use produces the next escalation), and the closure is a genuine Conceptual Repricing: the world’s medium of story changes with visible cost (stars erased, lighthouse dissolved, role transformed). Orientation—where and who we are—is established quickly and never lost despite the surreal turns. If anything, the middle could use one sharper moment of resistance or doubt to complicate the otherwise smooth progression of wonders.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present-tense experiments with the wing and tea anchor a series of visions that progressively reframe the donor’s quest and Hoshiko’s purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she shifts from studying/collecting to teaching others how to become porous, with the folded painting as a concrete emblem of that change. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized—she will “disappear inside” stories—yet the before/after is legible and the drive lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → dream-mapping → pin’s echo → revelation about trees → deconstruction/transformation → descent. Causality holds within the established magical logic, especially the way moonlight and dreams interact with the sextant to change matter and drain ambient sorrow. Closure is strong via conceptual repricing: “quantify nothing” and the cedar-sxtant reweight all prior measurement imagery with a felt, if quiet, cost. The pin’s moment is more a resonant fulcrum than a true turn under pressure, so stakes shift conceptually more than they tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal throughline—world dying because songs stopped; she uses memory and song via the mica to restart communal singing and thus the dawns—is coherent and escalates cleanly into a decisive change. The beats link well: initial vision through the mica → partial song awakening → appearance of silhouettes → attack of tarry vines → self-wounding and name-reclamation → altered song that invites mutual reflection, culminating in restored dawns and community. Closure is strong: the realm’s condition, the keeper’s identity-state, and the world’s rules are all visibly different with on-page cost. The main limitation is that setbacks (especially the vines) are resolved quickly, so the structural test is passed more elegantly than harrowingly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is tight and legible: arrival in the library under threat, the ticking clock to midnight, the purge trigger, and the confrontation with Vale all accumulate toward her choice. The causal link between the invitation’s “gift of absence” and her use of it to vanish is clean and satisfying. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—Elara surrenders her embodied life to become the library’s presence. The later “years later” beat extends the pattern without muddling the central drive.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/textural lens: discovery of the impossible loaf → refusal to eat → alliance with the gardener → guerrilla planting → recall/uncloaking → reopened bakery and reframed understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the sacred was continuous, and her stance toward ordinary bread (and her own role) has changed with palpable emotional cost. The drive is thematic rather than plot-twisty, but stakes around urban forgetting and guilt remain coherent. A slightly sharper on-page dilemma or concrete setback in the middle would deepen structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: ascent → setup of apparatus → sequential testing of each vow → collapse of each → descent and final transference into the tree. Causality is clean within the lyric frame (fuel dwindles, vows fail, glass shatters), and the final image of data becoming sap is a clear conceptual repricing of the entire experiment. Orientation and rules are legible early without clunky exposition. The before/after—the last functioning vows vs. their conversion into legend/sap—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The overnight structure is clean and causal: she goes to trade the fob, waits in escalating suspense for a possible interruption, then chooses to hand it over when dawn comes and the father never appears. Closure lands clearly in the mermaid changing hands and the cylinder labeled with her broken trust, a decisive before/after with emotional cost. The accumulative wait—tide rising, market sinking, sky bruising—tightens options in a controlled way. There are no orientation or lens issues; the experimental elements (emotion-recording phonograph, tear as diamond) are integrated smoothly into the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the bluff → pull of the ring → encounter and convergence → descent with seed and new stance. Causality is legible under a lyric frame: the ring’s emergent pull leads her to the woman; acceptance follows the experiential proof of merging weather. Closure is solid—she descends changed, with new tools (seed, altered ring) and a clear before/after in her understanding. The piece does read more as an extended vignette than a tightly plotted scene, but within a 600–800 word lyric scope, the single arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is accumulative but causally coherent: hiding from the festival leads to the cave, to the painting, to the tube, to the parchment, to the lock opening, to the collaborative transformation, to her changed behavior aboveground. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines her calling and practice, with the crystalline beam to the festival and her new “blank sheet” work as concrete after-effects. The mother-date/lock motif and the shift from 4-7-9 to 7-4-9 in the dream neatly reprice time and memory at the end. A slight density of magical turns in the cave (crystal growth, sound in the lock, chorus of voices) risks feeling stacked but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drying oasis → disillusionment → discovery of envelope → assembling the map → journey to the cathedral → confrontation with the letters and Corin → redefined role as “postmaster of honesty.” Structure is linear and well-contained, with one primary throughline and a satisfying closure via conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never becomes murky. The only constraint is that external stakes (curfew, toxicity) remain more atmospheric than acutely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: ascent → installation → calibration → comet event → descent/gift, all under a single pressure—will wonder be preserved. Causality is intact and legible (comet’s return leads to urgent final calibration, which enables the nonverbal “symphony of truth”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: after the comet, she entrusts the work to mountain, sky, and a new child, making a before/after palpable. The cost is conceptual but clear: she relinquishes control of her life’s work and accepts that wonder must live in others’ ears, not hers.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: magnetic shift → impending burn/miniaturization → box’s resistance → K-17’s integration and sacrifice. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the drive lens (accumulative with causal beats) holds to closure. Closure is strong: the farm and android transform into a single impossible flower, a decisive change with conceptual and personal cost. If anything, the transition from “protocol demands the burn” to “I will become its heart” is slightly compressed; one more on-page beat of hesitation would deepen the causal bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight and legible: rumor → investigation → nocturnal vigil → morning ritual → reconfigured shop, all causally linked. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she decides not to open the box, channels the unresolved mystery into a communal practice, and pays the cost of leaving the enigma intact. Stakes remain appropriately scaled to emotional and communal healing, and nothing important is resolved offstage. A hair shy of 9-band only because escalation relies more on tonal deepening than on a sharp final hinge or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric surface: dice → chosen airlock → vortex → archive → ingestion → ascent → transmission to the child. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s vulnerability encoded as strength, released into the world via song and dance, with the lab’s loss as cost. Orientation is precise from the first line (who/where/what kind of world) and never slips. The main constraint is that obstacles are minimal and success feels nearly inevitable, so the felt risk to her and to the mission is high-concept but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story’s causal spine is clean: whale beaches → gravity pockets → Miren descends to chamber → ritual with flowers/shadow → memories emerge and disperse → she returns to the pier changed. The salt-chamber sequence gives a single meaningful tightening as the gravity collapses and memories coalesce, then resolves into a quieter aftermath. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines what “retrieving” means and accepts a new equilibrium where memories are communal and partial, with a conceptual and emotional price on the page. Structure is essentially single-scene with one smooth transition back to the pier, and there are no causality breaks or orientation debts.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: ritual preparation → mapping silence → cranes/sigil → prophecy fights back → counterword → swallowing the sphere, with each move flowing logically. Backstory is economically tied to the present and sharpens the stakes of the current ritual. Closure lands solidly: the world is measurably altered (prophecy hushed, birdsong freed) and the cost persists inside his chest. The lens feels hybrid (ritual-causal plus accumulative imagery), but it holds without ambiguity through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: weekly ritual → intensified meteor event → interrogation → revelation of the tutor’s nature → transfer of authority → new pattern with Mrs. Chen. Causality is solid within the lyric frame: the need summons the tutor, the seal enables communication, the interrogation elicits the building’s confession, which precipitates the handoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator steps into the tutor’s role and the story’s premise (“agreed upon lies” as social grammar) is reweighted through the final “stay” and rooftop-as-present-continuous image. Stakes—who holds the burden and privilege of listening to buildings—are clearly altered by the end with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: shell → gate → tunnel → pond → ritual → public archive → aftermath. Closure lands decisively with a felt cost (her permanent grayscale vision) and a conceptual reconfiguration (private trauma becoming communal archive). The drive remains coherent throughout, with no orientation issues despite the density of imagery. The final commuter humming the lullaby is a precise, on-page proof of the new status.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory that remains anchored to present stimuli (stones, thorn, key) and builds toward an internal turning point. Causality is coherent: sister’s execution → years of “calibrated treason” → return to sanctuary → blood-writing confession → renunciation of vengeance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: she abandons the talisman of vengeance and reframes the key as access to her own heart, then walks into daylight. The only structural blemish is the mid-sentence fragment (“the blood-written confession of a”), which reads like an unintentional glitch rather than purposeful unfinishedness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: shell → nexus discovery → descent via “progressive disclosure” → confrontation with the echo cocoon → finishing the farewell to alter her fate. Closure is a clear Decisive Change: after the completed goodbye, the canyon stops echoing her, her mother is released, and Lira exits with a redefined future (“Go, echo by choice, not by accident”). Stakes and rules are introduced early and paid off (unfinished departures loop; finished goodbyes travel on) without retroactive patching. The only limit keeping this short of the very top band is that external obstacles are minimal; most resistance is conceptual rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: dream → shrine investigation → descent through glacier memories → retrieval and resurfacing → reflective coda, with each step logically following the last. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the pure snow globe reconfigures wreckage as a cradle for light, and her future role is glimpsed. The causal throughline is intact, though obstacles are fairly yielding and the price of success is more implied than dramatized. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the pattern (lyric progression with recurring objects) is taught and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single scene with a tight accumulative drive: climb → search → discovery of the whisk → patterned realization → return to work. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens (moon paths, rhythm, inscription, oarsman’s change of course), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration of what hidden acts mean. Cost is present though quiet: she re-commits to ongoing, uncelebrated labor with new weight. Nothing breaks causality or orientation, but the pressure curve remains contemplative rather than sharply tightening, keeping this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: broadcast → orchard → shredded letters → stillpoint → diamond → decision to broadcast lies via the tree, with no major missing links. The story maintains a single continuous scene with a clear, escalating task structure (locate stillpoint, decode letters, access sub-root chamber, survive the diamond’s curse, decide what to do with it). Closure is solid: a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing occurs when she transforms the cursed diamond from private torment into a distributed moral hazard for the land, with visible cost to the orchard. The only limitation is that external stakes remain relatively contained to this symbolic act; we don’t see clear downstream options change for Marisol beyond implied future burden.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight: we move from anomalous transmission → coordinates/portico → explicit cost lyric → decisive double act (broadcast + crossing), followed by a brief coda showing impact. Causality is coherent under a Hybrid/Accumulative lens; the lyric density never renders what’s happening obscure. Closure is strong: Elara’s transformation into a distributed ghost-prophet is a clear decisive change with cost (her erasure and embrace of being “darkness others flee”). The only slight shortfall is that some middle reflections restate premise rather than adding new tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure (morning ritual → jar capture → child’s voiced desire → opening and feeding the box → projection and shared listening) is clean and yields a clear before/after. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the world’s rule-set around memory and redemption is reweighted by “We are still becoming” and the town’s hum. Causality is soft but coherent for a lyric piece; each step follows from the prior desire and environment. The main limitation is that cost and risk are implied rather than sharply dramatized in a concrete dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: artifact cracking → nightmares manifesting → Mireya’s attempt to heal via vibrational matching → escalation with calving ice and advancing shadows → third-way resolution and aftermath. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration: she changes the rule from “sound wards nightmares” to “sound teaches darkness to listen,” and we see on-page consequences (healed Echo, quieted marina, dreamless town). The main weakness is that the high-stakes trolley problem (artifact vs. town) is resolved by an unproblematic third option with no structural snag or persistent cost, which softens the sense of paid price. Structurally, though, it’s tight and self-contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: repeated mapping of moon paths and viaduct hums converges into the spiral diagram and the chosen instant under the keystone. Causality is tight under the textural lens: because he reads subtle irregularities and waits, the field buckles at the exact moment the villages are primed to act. Closure lands on a clear, on-page reconfiguration—systems blackout, silent signal, and Elian’s offering of the compass—showing a before/after in the world’s power alignment and his role in it. The cost is implicit but legible: he gives up both his tool and his impulsive drive to trigger an irreversible revolution he won’t theatrically participate in.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: suicides → investigation → physical descent → discovery of tally marks and hidden journal → personal connection → decision to file a fuller, truer report. The single continuous scene in the tunnel provides solid structural unity, and the closure beat (her choice to walk back and tell the whole story) is legible with conceptual cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a thematic overlay, and that lens holds through the end. External stakes (institutional consequences, risk to Mara) remain somewhat abstract, which slightly mutes the sense of structural culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: Emil’s belief the heart can be saved → visit to Olya → repair parallels and enables his choice to seek a “second opinion” on Rowan’s case via the journalist. The story maintains a single throughline of pressure (time before execution) and lands closure with a clear decisive change plus reweighted stakes. The only soft spot is that institutional resistance (governor, system) stays offstage, so the external risk of his choice is more implied than enacted, which slightly mutes the climax. Nonetheless, the ending offers a coherent before/after and legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Algorithm → pursuit over time → “Descend” command → confrontation with the bell → act of ringing-as-translation, with the Algorithm resetting at the end. Causality holds and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing—the bell’s function and Juniper’s role are redefined with a tangible echo into future generations. Stakes remain relatively abstract (a metaphysical quest rather than a dire on-page dilemma), which keeps the felt cost somewhat muted. Still, the drive lens is consistent and the ending lands as a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong: anomalous hashtag → patch/lullaby frequency → coordinates → server farm → Block 73 bargain → global leak. The closure unit (her choice to open the file and accept erasure, followed by the chorus spilling onto the open net) lands with clear conceptual and emotional cost. Structure is linear and legible despite the lyrical mode, with no orientation debt and one coherent drive lens. A minor limitation is that some crucial revelations (the AI staging the crash, corporate motives) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the climactic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is coherent and satisfying: shard → mirrors → harbor → empathy crate → confrontation → restored sphere → reconfigured border. The mirror transition and return are clean, and the clock (dawn/ice floes) gives a subtle but real structural spine; closure lands decisively with the new beacon and a thickened, redefined border. The harbor logic (crated emotions, labeled empathy) works conceptually, though the crate marked with her exact surplus treads close to convenient symbolism. Overall, the piece maintains a clear Causal/Accumulative hybrid drive with no real orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: arrival with a stated purpose, the hinge encounter with the boy at the gangway, then a telescoped “years later” that pays off her reoriented life and the parasol’s fate. Causality holds—her decision not to record, to follow the boy, to tap the parasol, and then to stay off the ship all flow from the fold in patience and reshape later options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the marina, parasol, and horn are reweighted so that endings become softer, not obliterating, and the cycle is explicitly shown restarting. The cost is quieter than the rhetoric suggests (her alternative paths—death on the mercy ship, spectator tourism—are not felt as sharply foreclosed), which keeps this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: rediscovered fragment → reconsideration of “impossibility” → metaphor of grafting → decision to risk a literal and emotional graft and to meet a bus again. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear before/after stance and a decisive change that carries risk. Closure lands as a Charged Poise / Decisive Change hybrid, though the material consequences of his decisions remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival → search for the clearing → manifestation → consecration → stabilization → departure, with a clear before/after around the echo’s stability. Causality is clean at this scale, and the rules of the clearing and parapet are taught through action rather than exposition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the echo is preserved and the pavilion resumes its function with a hidden new layer. The main limitation is that the process feels highly assured; the risk of failure is gestured at but never bites into the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → ritual of arranging and keying the photos → communal witnessing → town’s exhale, with each phase deepening the initial premise. The causal chain holds under a textural lens: her repeated Saturdays and today’s specific ritual lead to the grandchildren’s response and the town’s conceptual release. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration—the town moves from long-held tension to a shared exhale—with an implied cost in the years of quiet labor. The piece avoids structural confusion, but the lack of a sharper hinge or turning-point slightly tempers its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one accumulative scene in the library, with the crystal’s sequences building toward the falling book and the “zygote” revelation. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: sounds → pattern recognition → library’s response → her decision to witness and depart. Closure lands in a resonant way with the last dictionary, the zygote, and the ongoing testimony of the crystal—an effective Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (she relinquishes control and ownership). There are no orientation issues or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: wandering/searching → following the driftwood pattern → discovery and playback of the tape → reframed understanding at the end. Causality under a textural lens holds: each image and object builds toward the final realization, and the closure beat (recognizing he is becoming the sound he seeks) lands with conceptual and emotional cost. A touch more foregrounding of the initial want as a live problem (versus a stated quest) early on could sharpen the sense of progression, but orientation and closure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: tremor → decision to use the spinning clock hand as film → shutter moment → collapse → departure, with each move logically emerging from the last under a stable, slightly surreal rule-set. Closure lands decisively as both a physical change (leaving, station imploding into the photograph) and a conceptual repricing (the observatory as darkroom of her own leaving), with clear cost. The drive lens—primarily accumulative/textural, with a causal spine—is coherent from early patterning (camera/time metaphors) through the charged final image. No orientation or causality debts meaningfully undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival with shard → bedside ritual and death → skybridge repricing, all causally linked through Mara’s choices. Closure lands solidly with the conceptual shift around “reunify”—she acts, discovers a new understanding, and we feel the cost of carrying unresolved pieces forward. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/when and the hospice’s liminal altitude), and there are no causality breaks or unkept set-ups. The single scene with a brief downstairs coda fits the length and delivers a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is strong: Lyra’s desire → key discovery → activation of automaton → entry into the shadow-void → choice to close the loop and trade her shadow → world-level restoration, with each move a clear “therefore.” Closure is solidly a Decisive Change with a conceptual afterglow: the world regains shadows at the price of Lyra’s own altered state and the sealing of the mechanism. The scene holds a single, coherent window with one escalation arc; no orientation debt or broken rules despite the surrealism. One could argue the trade itself is somewhat under-argued on the page, but the cost is clear and integrated into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: each revelation (fake corpse, true boy, garden path, map of judged missteps) deepens a single moral stake rather than adding new plotlines. Causality is coherent—her past bone-setting leads to the misidentification, which leads to the crisis, which summons the garden’s response and the changeling’s invitation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she conceptually reprices “mistake” into a structural principle for healing, with the cost of relinquishing former certainty and simple blame. No orientation or lens-ambiguity issues impair the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: each ritual step and environmental response (mist coiling, drop of seawater, wall smoothing) tightens toward the emergence and dissolution of the pearl. Causality within the magical logic holds, and the closure beat—a resonant reconfiguration where Lira loses the pearl but gains internal stillness shared with the village—is on the page with conceptual and emotional cost. There are no orientation issues; we know who/where/when very early, and the story remains in a single, legible causal chain. The only modest limitation is that opposition remains largely implicit rather than dramatized, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: viral confession → retreat to data center → encounter with Elias → second recording → burial. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she refuses the internet’s claim on her story by creating a new, buried testimony with cost (relinquishing reach for integrity and control). Causality under a textural lens is tight; each beat grows naturally from the previous one and from the viral context. The final blinking circuit and ant-shadow image clearly mark a before/after without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival at the nexus → three escalating apparitions → decisive offering of the shell → return to the city and completion of the novel. Causality is strong under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—each cameo alters Mara’s stance, culminating in Lira forcing the central decision. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses courage, finishes the book, and redefines her relation to “collecting hopes.” No significant orientation or causality slips; the brief time jump back to her desk is smooth and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: wait → song → vine activation → transformation → pollen harvest → release, with a clear ticking clock in the harvest moon and a legible before/after (a valley in forgetting → a valley remembering). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing as the remedy spreads and the songs return. All the set-ups (golden ratio tendril, limited bloom time, song sequences, phoenix feather) pay off in the ritual. The main limitation is that the path to success feels relatively unthreatened—no turn where failure seems genuinely imminent—so the climax reads controlled rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: careful traversal → discovery of the plate → sealing ritual → orchard awakening → decision to remain as translator forms a coherent before/after. Causality within the lyric frame is solid—his silence and care enable the sealing, which in turn animates the orchard and generates the “living score.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses the path of departure to fulfill the role of listener/map-keeper, with the cost legible in his acceptance of permanent stillness. A hair more tension around the risk of failure during the sealing could have sharpened the structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the cavern → investigation and experimentation → reversal of the mechanism → restoration of time → epilogue in the cellar. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is strong: each observational beat (reflections, echo delays, sound-scalloped metal) builds to the reassembly-in-reverse and release of hours. Closure is clear and charged: time is restored and wonder is deliberately sequestered, with a conceptual price. The only slight limitation is that the investigative middle proceeds so smoothly that moment-to-moment tactical stakes never feel in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean, single-arc ritual: descent, gathering burdens, environmental pushback, confession, release. Causality holds: her methods with the burner generate the burden-sheets; the grotto’s resistance and the sputtering lamp force the decisive choice to voice her own story; that confession visibly alters the space and resolves the valley’s danger. Closure is strong and on-page, with the violet flame, unfolding walls, and settled valley forming a clear before/after. The drive lens is accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings, and it remains consistent through to the charged final image of the sealed grotto awaiting the next weaver.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one continuous kettle-framed session of carving, with memories triggered by concrete present actions. Each step in the carving process deepens or refracts the central event (the failed leap and Emil’s death), tightening focus without needing overt reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the latch rehung, the finished carving placed to catch morning, and her intention to carve the lion’s face next all signal a new stance toward loss with visible emotional cost. Causality is internally consistent under a textural lens; nothing crucial feels arbitrary or under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is tight: arrival after the halt → summoning the ghost via story-slides → confrontation over collected regrets → breaking the wheel and reading latent possibilities → a reconfigured stance as the carousel restarts. Causality is clear within the surreal logic (each click produces a slide that manifests a scene/ghost, the broken squares freeze the lagoon, which crystallizes the negotiation moment). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: “negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion,” followed by the decisive image of boarding alone as the ghost dissolves into fog, with visible emotional cost. The time frame (03:17–03:27) and restart of the carousel give a satisfying temporal bracket without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative-causal arc: enter terminal → diagnose hydraulics → experiment with flow → awaken birds/drone/fountain → reprice the place’s purpose → depart with a new rule for hope. Closure is strong and on the page, in the combined awakening of the machinery and the conceptual shift (“measure what returns”) that reframes the terminal as a site of repair rather than failed departure. Each beat grows logically out of the last without unkept setups or teleporting elements. The cost is quieter and conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is legible in her acceptance of a long, lonely reclamation project instead of instant triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: he ascends, performs a ritual of relinquishment, and the years-later coda reweights that act into myth and lasting inner peace. Causality is soft but functional—his inability to bear the failed clock leads to the observatory, which leads to the offering that enables closure. The closure unit (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) is strong and legible: he surrenders the dream and gains a new stance toward time. Minor risk is that stakes stay purely internal and there are no real surprises in the arc, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is strong: the morning-radio boarding → log-decoding training → coordinate discovery on the sundial → bunker → journals → new mission arc follows a clear because/therefore chain. Orientation (who/where/when) is established very early and never wavers despite the lyric density. Closure is a genuine decisive change and conceptual repricing: Mara relinquishes the sundial and turns from private excavation to public dismantling of myths, with on-page emotional cost. The only thing holding this just under 9 is that external obstacles are minimal, so the path feels a touch smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: Ari retrieves and decodes the rope, the harbormaster arrives to threaten confiscation, and she responds by both preserving the rope and enacting the method through on-the-spot planting. Causality is tight within an accumulative/lyric frame—each detail (lightning, fulgurite, rope-text) feeds the final act and the dock’s transformation at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: heritage moves from fragile memory to embodied regrowth in the dock itself with a visible before/after. The cost is present but understated (risking legal trouble, exile from this harbor), leaning more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → ritual with the thread → apparitions → self-revelation → departure. Causality within the lyric mode holds—each move grows from the previous one, especially the thread’s escalating transformation from object to collective presence to her younger self. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she finishes the work, plants the thread, and chooses re-entry into life with a new understanding of healing. The only minor limitation is that the on-page “cost” of this choice is more implied than dramatized in concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine under an accumulative/lyric surface: desire → experimental assembly → hatching → unintended world-shifting consequence. The closure is strong: the colored wind escapes, the palace begins to fall, and the prince’s stance toward that cost reconfigures the premise. Some intermediate beats (moonlight distillation ratios, music-box Morse) are more imagistic than necessity-tested, but they still build a legible process. Stakes and outcome align, and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear and cohesive: annual ritual → trench and graft → coin-tie → vow to return with saplings creates a felt before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis when she shifts from bringing sand (residue of harm) to planning saplings (growth), at visible emotional cost. Backstory shards are well-anchored in present stimuli and each re-tilts the ritual rather than stalling it. Causality is more emotional than event-driven, but the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds and the final image decisively reweights all prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The breadcrumb structure—four fountains culminating in Forgiveness—gives the piece a clear, legible arc with accumulative turns. Causality is coherent: follow breadcrumb → encounter fountain → surface memory → move toward release, and closure lands with the emptied box and resumed geese. The design is a bit schematic, with each fountain mapped to a labeled emotional station, which slightly reduces surprise and organic feel. Still, the story delivers a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules (paused time, trapped memories) clearly shift in response to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walking and pinging → anomalous echo → step off the path → discovery of the hidden beacon → union of gear and light → garden-wide transformation. Causality holds under a textural/causal hybrid lens, and closure is on-page with a clear before/after: a generational pattern of sacrificial blooming is reconfigured into transmission without burning, with Kael’s stance and the garden’s behavior both altered. Stakes stay conceptually scaled to the lyric premise and the cost—relinquishing his destined fracture and rooted sorrow—is legible, though the sense of risk or potential failure is quite gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → following the monarch → discovering poem-chrysalises → hidden headstones → chrysalis and reorientation form a legible progression. Causality is soft but present—the butterfly and grandmother’s mentorship clearly motivate each next discovery. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: grief shifts from something carved in stone to an ongoing transformation, with a clear before/after in her role. The main weakness is a slight sense of over-explained insight in the final third, which flattens some structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: years of winding → final letter “—e” → decision in the pendulum’s pause → modification of the mechanism → observable change in village and ridge. The structure (dawn decision, then dusk confirmation) gives satisfying closure with a clear before/after in the world’s rules. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: time’s function shifts from measuring debt to carrying apology. The only minor strain is the amount of reflection packed into a “space of one heartbeat,” but the lyric mode mostly earns that compression.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is precise and satisfying: coin → tapestry cipher → secret drawer → map → digging at the lamb → root cellar → role acceptance. The story maintains a single, coherent drive—“discover the shape of intentions”—from the inciting find through to the descent into the cellar. Closure is strong: the act of going below and the door locking behind her is a decisive change with conceptual and practical cost. The only slight limitation is that the puzzle-solving feels smooth and low-friction; more visible resistance or risk during the decoding would sharpen structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: orientation is clean from the first sentence, and each beat (tracking the shadow, climbing, listening, writing, dissolving) tightens around the core constraint of one future before dawn. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode—each new action (touching the quill, writing, sacrificing memories) arises logically from the prior frame. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she chooses not to write a single future but the conditions for futures, becoming the constraint itself. The only small limitation is that the “clock” pressure of dawn stays more conceptual than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: famine/ministry → pirate rumor → nightly listening → decoded code → solstice plan → improvised broadcast → inspectors’ inhalation → altered world. Structure is essentially linear with accumulative lyric beats, and the solstice deadline plus weekly inspections provide a subtle but real clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s narrative rules are reweighted when dust and even inspectors become carriers of story, with clear before/after. The only limit is that her risk of punishment never quite bites on the page; danger is implied rather than concretely tested against her body or freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparing the installation → placing the chair at the vanishing point → donning the mask → scattering powder in spirals that culminate in the charged final image. Causality is soft but coherent—each action grows from the previous and from the installation’s internal logic, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “safety” and “story.” However, the piece leans heavily on reflection and image without a clear mid-beat structural turn that tightens options, which keeps it below the very top band. Orientation and lens are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sewer hiding → recollection of dives and ledgers → discovery of the sump → creation and hiding of the lead sheet → emergence and public statement. Each step logically grows from the previous, and the closure (her first public words and inner settling) lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost of exposure. The drive lens is consistently accumulative/textural with situational pressure from the city’s denial rather than tight causal plotting, which suits the premise. A slightly sharper on-page trigger for why “tonight” is the night she acts (beyond the moonbeam cue) could make the inciting beat feel less arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Mara enters with a clear ritual purpose, deepens the practice through syllable-gathering and voice sacrifice, and we see a reconfigured city as a direct outgrowth of this night. The drive lens is textural/accumulative, but causality within the fable’s rules holds: subtracting noise leads to changing rhythms, children humming, and the rosette’s eventual dissolution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the city’s idea of “enemy” becomes sonically illegible, with Mara’s silence as the new ground note. The only arguable softness is that certain civic changes (riots calmed, borders closed) sit mostly in summary, but they still feel motivated by the central act.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: theft of the seed → planting at alignment → pruning/release of scents → transformed workers/city → disarmed Ministry. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment functions as a clear temporal spine, and the closure lands with a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing (the state loses monopoly on memory). Cost is present (treason, blood, risk of capture) but remains mostly implied rather than pressed to a breaking point on the page. Structure is otherwise tight and legible with one continuous scene blooming into a brief morning coda.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → no visitors/failed hive → boy’s box/riddle → ascent → second riddle → deliberate lie → lightning and reanimated hive → changed toll practice. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: Mara’s relationship to truth, tolls, and wonder is reconfigured with costs implied for her job and self-concept. The magical disappearance of the boy is a bit convenient but reads as deliberate fable-logic rather than a plot hole. Structure holds as a single through-line with one transition (booth to tower), no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: noticing arrhythmic houses → shard test at the Forsythe place → coded summons to the shack → ritual with the compass and objects → village-wide exhale and refined mission. Causality is mystical but internally coherent; the shard’s presence disturbs, her ritual resolves, with the compass as focal mechanism. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she reconceives “aliveness” in houses as conversation activated by attention to absence. The cost—accepting that some absences stay empty and that her work is ongoing—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: awakening → understanding the garden’s hidden stance → choice point at the arch → aftermath of release, all causally linked. Closure lands as a decisive change (ampoule broken, city reconfigured) with conceptual cost visible in the narrator’s acceptance of the court’s hypocrisy. The accumulative/lyric mode is consistent and the before/after is legible without over-explanation. If anything, the “city’s last secret” setup could carry slightly more concrete threat to heighten the stakes of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climbing → anomalous dice result → staircase slowing → blood-marked sigma → negative steps → ripple/door → final rupture. Causality is metaphorical but legible (her equation/blood “proof” perturbs the system, then her dice-sacrifice triggers systemic rupture), and the closure beat (the staircase forgetting her) reconfigures the rules with conceptual cost. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early without confusion, and the single-scene flow supports the lyrical mode. The only limit is that stakes and rules shift more texturally than via explicit narrowing of options, which may feel slightly soft to a purely causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: climb → set-up with brush and mirror → activation of mural → greenhouse-as-lung realization → communal breathing with Jules → morning aftermath and city echo, all causally legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira has completed the mural, seeded the city with lost kindness-words, and finally sleeps, with cost in her profound exhaustion and the implied fragility of what she’s done. The dominant drive is textural/accumulative rather than problem/solution, but pressure does tighten once the brush starts humming and the mural’s purpose shifts from wall to lungs. There’s no major causality break or orientation issue, though stakes remain relatively gentle for a “last filter before publication” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: Aurelia’s long wait, the thaw cutting off the beekeeper, and the Chen family’s initiative all lead to her conceptual repricing of what “preserving culture” means. The closure is solid: she sets down the opera glasses and takes up dough, with the final loss (beekeeper never returns) offset by a reweighted understanding of rescue and art. Transitions (from waiting to dream to waking transformation) are legible and time is coherent. Escalation is more emotional than event-driven, but the before/after is unmistakable and costs—loss of illusion, loss of former role—are on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: prophecy → voyage to lighthouse → discovery of yoyo mechanism → experiment-driven escalation → decisive string-cutting and temporal fold → return with altered cost. Closure is strong and legible: he has escaped his foretold death but at the price of his unique craft. The drive lens stays consistently causal with some accumulative textural layering, and there are no orientation issues despite the surreal elements. The only minor limitation is that the mechanics of the time-fold are more poetic than strictly dramatized, but the emotional and logical beats still land.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival after resuscitation → entry into funhouse → cursed booth → mirror corridor → encounter with fear-child → relinquishing the clasp. Causality is legible even in the lyric mode (the cursed photo enables the corridor; the dictionary’s paradox enables the final exchange), and there is a clear before/after in her relationship to fear and the advisor. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes all prior hauntings as mirrors designed to force forgiveness, with the advisor’s disappearance as clear cost. The drive lens holds consistently as accumulative with causal threads, and no orientation debt or late rule-change undercuts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly bifurcated (blue-hour recording → dawn Doldrum confrontation), with clear orientation and a legible through-line from preparation to test. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build-up of sonic practices (sketching resonance, dubbing, fractals) coheres into the final tactic that moves the raft. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the Doldrum Wall is redefined from dead calm to playable instrument, and the raft edges forward in direct response. The cost is more conceptual than visceral—no real risk of failure or consequence is dramatized—so the ending is beautiful but emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: tremor → atlas comparison → match to expedition → altered pattern → watchers’ response → glimpse of the lost expedition → reinterpreted gate → new chart and trajectory for Chelon. Closure is a strong conceptual repricing: the gate’s meaning flips from oppression to painful protection, and this reweights every prior mention of the expedition and the Crack. The cost—she gains truth but remains separated from her mother and must turn that into a “terrible chart” for others—reads clearly on the page. The watchers’ quick, almost obedient response to one altered note is slightly convenient but still coherent within the established pattern-language premise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: she arrives with a clear goal, follows the smugglers’ map, retrieves the letter, faces the complication of the watchman, and escapes, ending with a changed future trajectory. Closure is solidly earned as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the dynasty’s founding lie is materially undermined, and her options—and the nation’s—are reweighted. Stakes are legible and scaled appropriately to the length, with no orientation or lens confusion. The structure is competent rather than surprising, so while fully publishable it doesn’t quite reach the most daring tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece runs as a single, coherent scene with a clean accumulative/textural drive: descent, successive fissures, and a culminating keystone void. Causality is modest but intact—tide and bridge create the window; her prior career motivates the clandestine survey; the final conceptual shift about “every separation” arises from what she’s just done. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes separation and foundations and chooses to leave her confessions embedded for future discovery. Stakes are internal and low-external, but the structure is tight enough for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clean causal chain from blackout → access to unscrambled stamp → investigation → darkness experiment → revelation → new indexing project. The backstory of the sunken city and library slots in efficiently and reweights the present rather than derailing it. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing plus a decisive commitment: the catalogue’s origin as erasure is revealed and Mara chooses to rewrite the index in defiance of the Council’s false history. The only slight limitation is that the external consequences of that choice are left almost entirely implied, softening the sense of immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: garden → paradox stair → basilica → ritual → return, each beat deepening the same drive rather than wandering. Causality holds within the surreal rules (she buys the ribbon, polishes the moonstone, performs the transformation), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dream is spent, the basilica reset, cranes lanternize the garden, and her sensory world changes at cost. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence (who/where/what kind of world) despite the lyric density. The only minor limitation is that opposition is largely internal and ritualized, so stakes never pivot sharply, they simply intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: surviving the strike, being drawn to the observatory, using the geode via perturbation theory to harvest potential, realizing the moral cost, and choosing a final perturbing act with the fall that redirects a future strike. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—he dies, and the world’s harm is slightly re-aimed. The accumulative lyricism never obscures where we are in the sequence, and the circuit-breaker/cooling constraint gives the structure a quiet, effective ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara tracks the pilgrim, confronts him, learns the chip’s function, and chooses to activate it, which produces the star-map that reconfigures her options. The piece builds to a clear closure unit—a resonant reconfiguration—where her understanding of the stars and her parents’ disappearance is reweighted with emotional cost. Structure is straightforward single-scene with light backstory inserts that don’t disrupt orientation or causality. The only limit is that the external problem is almost frictionless—the pilgrim’s cooperation and the mechanism’s success are never in doubt—so escalation reads more as revelation than as hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: terrace → shore and memory → discovery of the carving → ascent and confrontation with the mother. The causal chain from his profession to his mother’s encrypted request to this meeting is clear, and the driftwood search provides a concrete mid-scene turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he’s prepared to confess, only to learn she has known all along, which recasts his years of lying and her recent request. The cost—accepting that his “kindnesses” have harmed and that his mother colluded to free him—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous negotiation ritual where each step (arrival, glove offering, naming fears, knotting rope, failed signatures) deepens the central situation. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens: Kael’s moon-timed pause leads to the vulnerability exercise, which enables the disarmament, which in turn allows a non-documentary resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the political conflict relaxes (coastlines no longer aiming cannons), and Kael’s inner economy of guilt is reweighted by giving up the pull. Stakes and before/after are legible without mechanical over-explanation, though the “moon calendar” mechanism stays more mystical than procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure holds cleanly: one night paddle from launch to the edge of the open sea, with mounting beats (gash in drysuit, fog, bioluminescent dolphins, shipping channel) that reweight her internal choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets regret and the broken compass as recalibration and commits to the “widening yes” of uncharted water, with the loss of old certainties as cost. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and orientation is never in doubt. The external situation could tighten one more notch of concrete risk, but the emotional cost still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean and strong: ward → clue in obituaries → journey through drains → confrontation with the lake’s bargain → choice to absorb pain → return and begin restitution. Closure lands decisively as both a personal transformation (from hollow to responsible) and a conceptual repricing of “clean slate” procedures and redemption. Each step follows a clear because/therefore logic, and the time-loop with the baseball reweights earlier details without retroactive patching. Costs are explicit on the page (enduring others’ pain, losing the comfort of amnesia) and constrain the ending rather than being waved away.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → ritual preparation with spices and blood → summoning the child-shadow → realization of the necessary sacrifice → fusion and reconfiguration as guardian. The piece runs on a Hybrid lens with a strong accumulative/lyric texture, but the because/therefore links are always legible. Closure lands decisively when she chooses to “die into the other’s form,” with the cost and before/after state palpable in the merged guardian. No orientation or lens-clarity debt appears, and all major set-ups (fortune, tree, phoenix) are paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is accumulative but causally coherent: time pooling → climb to the cloud-glade → card reading → crack widening into canyon/voices → cloud descent → temporal reset in the backyard → final offering and legacy. Each beat follows as a motivated extension of the last, with the saucer crack and cloud logic carrying the throughline. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to 3:42 a.m. with altered stance and a healed object that reweights all prior images. The cost—reaccepting linear time and grief into her body—is made explicit in “Time rushed back into her body in a single inhale… until she laughed and wept simultaneously.”

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: photos → Tear → sail → bruise → auditorium, each step causally and emotionally building on the last under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—ship into seed/lantern, mission redefined—with a clear before/after and conceptual cost (her self-exile and permanent tending of the archive). Orientation (who/where/when) is fast and solid. All major set-ups (Tear, gravity spinner, photographs, joy as propulsion) pay off in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: release of the bugs → coincidences → eruption and detour → prophecy-aligned path → cave immersion → transformed return to the beach. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Kael’s understanding of value and purpose has clearly shifted with a legible before/after. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, but the treasury loss, self-confrontation in the glass, and acceptance of a new “currency” give the ending weight. No major orientation or lens-clarity issues arise despite the density of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is tight: blackout → meeting with Luce → decoding sundial → infiltrating the keep → generator trick → Voss interruption → transfer of the “heartbeat” → barges breaking free. The story maintains a single coherent night-time operation with no orientation slippage and a clean before/after (fort under control vs fort unlocked and drifting into revolution). Voss’s interruption is a well-placed complication, not a derailment, and Garnet’s quick lie pays off in the aether-redirect beat. Cost is more implied (massive upheaval, treason) than dramatized in consequences, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: friction vanishes → eels vanish → Elias arranges rocks → star dust activates → eels return as light, leading to a conceptual reweighting of his promise. Orientation is excellent from the first lines (who/where/what’s wrong with the world are all anchored) and the ritual sequence gives a clear spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from striving to understand to accepting his role as witness, with Mira’s death reframed as part of the pattern. The only limit is that causal stakes remain mostly metaphysical; nothing tests or narrows his options in a concrete “or else” way.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: ascent → preparation in darkroom → stormside vision → decisive re-routing of her words from earth to sky → disappearance and postscriptal rumor. Causality is clear at each link (lightning overexposure → revelation about transmission path; timetable strips → chemical solution → petri dish → vanished trace), and the observatory frame contains the entire arc cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the observatory becomes an ungoverned vessel, the timer a haunting recurrence, and the censorship regime conceptually outflanked. The only reason this doesn’t push into the very top band is that external stakes (punishment, discovery) stay offstage, so the cost is primarily conceptual and symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: Elian notices the incomplete sundial, initiates a duel whose turns reveal a clue about the brook, and this leads to a joined wait for dusk and a Council entry as collaborators—causal and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: rivals become co-authors, with the Council doors and chime marking a clear before/after. The cost is quiet but present: they forgo the expected adversarial showdown and surrender years of entrenched rivalry. All key setups (sundial, brook, waiting, needle card) are paid off without dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clear: Lark’s molt and habit of hiding old selves lead to the collaboration with Marin, to rebuilding the space, to the confrontation with Rourke, and finally to the reconfiguration of the library’s role via the grant cover-story. The story holds a Hybrid lens—causal actions nested in accumulative lyric texture—and closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the library shifts from doomed ruin to sanctioned “program,” and Lark’s role redefines. Cost is legible in their risk (defying carceral norms, burning his past selves, gambling on bureaucratic logic) and in the acceptance that future resistance must live partly inside the system’s optics. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean despite the surrealism: station → hatch/ladder → sky-garden → film-loop → choice and return, each step causally motivated. The global drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the decisive change—choosing to exit the loop and end the chord—lands clearly with a felt cost (forfeiting endless “maybes”). Setups (clock, board, refuge, chime trade) all pay off, and the final “Onward” plus resumed ticking reconfigure the story’s premise of time/return without contradiction. There are no orientation or lens-clarity debts; the closure unit is strong and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: arrive to assess the ridge → enter communal dream → discover the fissure → pay with a memory to learn how to mend it → wake and enact the solution. The dream sequence is well integrated and legible, not a digression, and the monsoon clock ties the outer and inner action together. Closure lands with a decisive change (the bargain and its on-page consequences) plus a conceptual repricing about doubt and cultural memory. The only thing keeping this shy of the 9-band is that the teacher relationship—central to the cost—is entirely off-page, making the structural logic flawless but the felt stakes slightly underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clear accumulative ritual: compass problem → three-step lace instructions → emotional release → coda years later. Causality is clean at the symbolic level (each instruction triggers a deeper confrontation with regret), and the closure—sorrow transferred into the bonsai, speech withheld to preserve the pattern—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early on and never in doubt. The only limit is that the stakes are purely interior and the “severance” with the mother stays offstage, keeping the plot from feeling fully pressured.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and effective, with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure that lands with conceptual cost (accepting insignificance). The convergence of the data (0.003% match) feels slightly convenient as a plot device, but it serves the thematic epiphany well. Orientation is immediate, and the causal chain is unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a dream logic that strains causality, particularly the convenient arrival of a bus on "desert flats" immediately after a canyon trek. The closure—a decision to open a new studio—relies on a sudden thematic epiphany ("permission to step off the path") rather than the cumulative pressure of the journey. The transition from the physical stakes of survival to the conceptual resolution feels disconnected.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from investigation to a Conceptual Repricing of silence as a new medium. The closure lands firmly with the realization that the world is not dead, only translated. The pacing is effective, though the coda with the child feels tonally distinct from the scientific discovery of the main scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a strong fable-like causality, where the solution (burning the names of the dead) perfectly matches the problem (revitalizing the signal for the dead). The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's life into a permanent role—lands with conceptual weight. The "dream" beat functions as a weak causal bridge, but the climax and resolution are structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear, culminating in a resonant symbolic closure. However, logistical convenience undermines the pressure: "ordinary vendor noise" at midnight in a sanctioned, darkened valley strains credibility, as does the arrival of unchecked crates at a known rail spur under a regime that detains mothers.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear dream logic where the ritual succeeds without obstacle or cost; the transition to the "orchard" relies on magical convenience that resolves the central tension instantly. Closure is achieved through a "magic wand" moment (eating the fruit) rather than an earned turning point, leaving the ending feeling functionally complete but emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tight and the magic system operates with consistent logic; the "retrocognitive" rules are taught early and pay off in the climax. The closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist stays in the garden but changes her relationship to the fading photos from terror to comfort. The cost—the loss of the halo fragment and the rejection of immortality—is felt and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is solid and the causal chain is clear, with a satisfying link between the musical code and the vault entry. However, the timing of the artillery shell—synchronizing perfectly with the pinning of the guards—relies on convenience that slightly undermines the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal trajectory within a fable-logic framework. The closure (Conceptual Repricing of her life's work) is distinct and follows directly from the climax, though the mechanics of "collecting absences" in a satchel require the reader to accept a sudden shift from sci-fi tech to pure surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence: the thief just happens to have stolen the client's face weeks earlier, which serves as the exact key to the resolution. This "magic wand" fix dissolves the central obstacle without earned causality or ingenuity. Additionally, the sentient flower station at the end introduces a new rule late in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to creation to departure with a clear internal shift. The closure (leaving the dome behind) serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, offering a solid conceptual cost—abandoning the sanctuary she created to let it serve others.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The climax suffers from a significant causal break: placing a seashell on a film projector’s feed reel to play visual footage creates a mechanical impossibility that the story’s established reality does not support. While the fable-like tone permits some leeway, the shift from gritty studio realism (DNA tests, trailers) to dream logic (casts with treasure maps, projecting shells) fractures the narrative coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building pressure through the dying star and the expanding map. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with clear conceptual cost—surrendering self to become the "first coordinate"—satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative loop structure is handled well, creating a legible pattern that pays off in the final reconfiguration of the robot's purpose. However, the closure relies on a philosophical acceptance ("asking better questions") rather than a visceral cost or sharp plot turn, making the resolution feel somewhat safe and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.0)
    The causal chain relies on significant contrivances, particularly the availability of the "Staff Memories" reel and the incoherent timeline of the three-month-old theft versus the immediate "scavenger hunt." The resolution is unearned, relying on a deus ex machina (the projection) rather than a logical consequence of the protagonist's actions. The inciting incident (the ticket) contradicts the backstory of deep, frozen suspicion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and circular, landing on a clear Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist accepts her true role. However, the inciting pressure (0.03% luck) is subverted too easily by the garden's immediate benevolence, reducing the narrative drive to a gentle sequence of gifts rather than earned outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is achieved via Earned Stasis; the mechanic explicitly chooses her current path over the "green moon" timeline. The narrative structure effectively builds pressure through the nexus interaction. The final paragraph, which trails off mid-sentence ("or"), functions as a stylistic representation of branching time, though it risks reading as an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative progression relies on dream logic where obstacles dissolve conveniently (water parting, code revealing itself) rather than through causal effort. The linear "walkthrough" structure lacks structural tension or a pivotal turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight Accumulative arc where internal pressure forces a necessary, ritualistic release. The causality follows a consistent dream-logic—smudging the drawing creates physical space for the stone—and the closure is resonant, offering a legible "after" state for the valley.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from investigation to a resonant discovery that recontextualizes the backstory. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, shifting the weight of the "swallowed truth" from lead to brass, offering a distinct and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cyclic, ritualistic structure fits the mythic tone perfectly, and the closure (transformation into the next cycle) is legible and earned; however, the linear progression lacks causal complications to test the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and the ritual provides a legible structure with a valid closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is linear and procedural, lacking a decisive turn or causality break that challenges the protagonist's plan.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, accumulative logic where discovery leads linearly to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation within the "silo library" is excellent, and the closure—becoming the axis—feels earned within the story's dream logic. The causal links are symbolic rather than mechanical, which fits the tone but makes the "puzzle" solution feel somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through the protagonist's departure and role transformation. The plotting is competent but relies on a somewhat convenient distraction mechanics (the cookie) and a metaphorical rather than causal realization by the Keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear causal chain leading to a Decisive Change. The mechanics of the loop pedal are integrated logically into the exorcism, and the closure lands with undeniable physical and existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure (ascending steps triggering memories) that successfully builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The logic of the magical realism holds up well, though the progression is somewhat linear and list-like until the final transformation of the lake.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive, utilizing the "drop and ripple" motif to structurally bookend the piece with precision. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the destruction of the tablet and the acceptance of gravity create a "conceptual repricing" of the protagonist’s existence with undeniable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is coherent, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief replaces numbness. However, the pivotal mechanism—backward songs unwinding memory—relies on a fable-like convenience ("She had read that...") rather than organic plot mechanics, slightly softening the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causality suffers from significant leaps, notably Elara's instant realization that Zone 9 contains "truth" rather than disease and her unearned knowledge of the antagonist's specific plan. While the closure (sending the pigeon) is logical, the path leading there relies on convenient intuitions.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain where the release of the scent triggers the orchid's reaction and the protagonist's subsequent epiphany. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elian's life purpose with a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is solid, utilizing an Accumulative lens to build pressure through memory and sensory detail. The closure—a defiant walk into starlight—lands as a valid Earned Stasis/Renunciation, though the "wandering poet" frame loosens the narrative drive slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure works well within the story's fable-like logic. However, the pacing is uniform, and the climax relies on the convenience of the seed sprouting overnight, which lowers the sense of earned causality and struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal trajectory with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure that feels earned. The "cracked vial" serves as a precise physical manifestation of the internal cost, effectively grounding the change in the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the closure (the locket as "freight") is resonant and structurally sound, the plot pivots on a major convenience: meeting the one janitor who not only knows the obscure wharf but also has a deep personal connection to Marisol’s mother. This coincidence resolves the central logistical hurdle rather than complicating it, which softens the narrative architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is solid, with clear orientation and a legible Accumulative drive toward the Causal closure. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively, recontextualizing the search as a procession. The causal link relies on a standard magical realization, but the active dedication of the glyph secures the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the magical logic of the giant's nap and borrowed time clearly established and consistently applied. Closure is achieved through a decisive conceptual exchange (future for echo) that reconfigures the protagonist's life. The cost is legible, though its consequences remain abstract (digits sailing away).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative structure is a linear lock-and-key procedural: the protagonist inserts an object, and the world yields immediately without complication. The lack of resistance or failure states robs the closure of earned weight. The "slip" of the eye offers a brief pause but no true causal obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.0)
    A severe causality break undermines the narrative: ferromagnetic tape fragments cannot produce sound simply by being uncovered or pushed through knotholes without playback equipment. This unestablished magical realism shatters the "methodical" physical grounding of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arcs cleanly to a Decisive Change (metamorphosis) with undeniable cost. The shift to a summary-heavy epilogue provides necessary context for the "after" state but slightly dilutes the visceral impact of the climax by moving into a distant register.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot hinges on a convenient meeting with a guide who explains the theme and resolves the conflict without tactical friction; the "market" setup is abandoned for this chance encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight and governed by the cave’s specific rules; the transaction of memory for magic is established early and paid off clearly. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist’s worldview and future are irrevocably altered, with the "exit required acceptance" beat sealing the structural arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The linear fetch-quest structure relies on frictionless transactions; obstacles (Customs, Conservatory, Cemetery) yield immediately to simple gestures without causal complication. While the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of narrative resistance in the middle beats flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic that holds the "Causal" lens, leading to a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's state is transformed. While the transition from the tunnel to the observatory relies on a sudden surreal shift ("condensing into a ceiling"), the closure lands with clear conceptual cost (the pain of punched memories).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with clear orientation and a distinct inciting incident (starlight on the tile). The closure (hiding the tile, abandoning the academic duty) is a decisive action that resonates with the character's internal change. Causality is driven somewhat by external magical timing (midnight, starlight) rather than purely protagonist agency, but the final choice is hers.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is clean and the closure is strong; the Decisive Change (Vey’s exit) and Resonant Reconfiguration (the mutineers’ new fate) land with clear conceptual costs. The narrative arc from the falling stone to the final door is tight and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, with a decisive closure that follows logically from the established magical rules. The trade-off provides a resonant, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving cleanly from ascent to interaction to transformation. The closure is distinct, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where the silence is "seeded," effectively reweighting the initial premise of the town's hush.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is excellent, moving seamlessly from an accumulative collection of fragments to a causal mission that inverts the story's central threat. Closure is a standout Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of repurposing the poison label to "reprint" memory resolves the plot while fundamentally altering Mara's status.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a strong accumulative structure (Mother, Colleague, Self) that builds coherently to a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing closure. The logic of the ritual is surreal but consistent within the established frame. The ending lands with a legible shift in the protagonist's stance and future direction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the threat of gentrification to a collective act of resistance. The closure is strong, employing a Conceptual Repricing where the city's survival depends on becoming "unreadable" rather than static. However, the climactic "reorganization" relies on dream logic that feels slightly convenient given the established corporate threat, and the transition to the result ("By sunrise...") summarizes the pivotal conflict rather than dramatizing the inspection.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure relies on a fragile but poetic conceit (the sand grain timer) that pays off beautifully at closure, creating a resonant reconfiguration of the "witnessing" act. The countdown provides coherent situational pressure that crystallizes in the final shutter click, satisfying the closure requirement with deep emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain: diagnosis, failed attempt, innovative solution, and success, all driven by the deadline. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that lands with the weight of Lira's emotional investment. The pacing effectively manages the countdown without resorting to cheap suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally linked, moving from signal to discovery to a resonant closure. The ending creates a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist shifts allegiance from the Registry to the river itself, fulfilling the prompt's structural demands with high competence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear ritual structure that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elian becomes part of the town. The causal link between the "north ward's guilt" and Elian's specific sacrifice is thematic rather than strictly logical, but the closure lands with a defined cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic where the "magic" of converting scent to frequency is accepted within the established tone. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the arrival of the rescue sub feels slightly rushed in the sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, ascending the lighthouse to a decisive conceptual closure. The "bodies" timeframe creates a slight genre wobble (police procedural urgency vs. magical realism), but the surreal logic holds. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the father's myth.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies on a montage structure ("The first time... On the second night...") that summarizes conflict rather than dramatizing it in a continuous scene. The resolution hinges on "dream logic" and a sudden download of information ("he understood the orchard’s purpose") rather than causal actions, weakening the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative flow is smooth and dream-like, utilizing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the weaving restores the sea. However, the progression is linear with minimal resistance; the solution (sewing the plate) presents itself without a "try-fail" cycle or significant obstacle, making the resolution feel somewhat convenient despite the established mythic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative operates in summary/synopsis mode ("spent days purposeful wandering," "season turned") rather than establishing a concrete scene window with immediate pressure. This "outline-like sequencing" distances the reader from the stakes and violates the short-story scope by compressing a novella's arc into a montage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the drone's arrival, creating effective deadline pressure that forces a clear closure choice. The resolution—an Earned Stasis where she chooses the ambiguity of the unsigned letter—lands with conceptual weight, though the logic of mailing a letter to a ghost is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fable-like structure works on its own terms, but the causal mechanism at the climax—a projected map instantly diffusing a violent coup—relies on magical convenience rather than earned pressure. The ending lacks a visible cost; the protagonist succeeds completely without sacrifice, which lowers the dramatic weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyric structure is coherent, guiding the reader through a ritualistic journey to a clear resolution. The closure (brother waking to the message) effectively bridges the magical and real, satisfying the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc of deciphering the cast to forge a connection is structurally sound and moving. However, the closure—signing a medical discharge form with a poetic metaphor ("handle with tides")—strains credibility within the established "cordite" reality of a field hospital.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear causal chain and a distinct closure event (the shard dissolving into the mural). However, the "risk" mentioned in the denouement ("exposed by risk") is not effectively dramatized in the scene, making the summary of her internal growth feel slightly unearned by the plot events.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recursive structure is executed with clarity, and the logic of the "folding" world holds together well to support the Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the middle section relies on a summarized list of "awakenings" to advance the plot, acting as a shortcut that bypasses the dramatic scene work needed to earn the realization fully.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.4)
    Causality is weak; the resolution relies on a convenient, pre-installed ventilation defense and undefined "warp residue" teleportation to solve the central problem. The protagonist escapes without paying a visible cost or facing a meaningful setback, resulting in low tension and a lack of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic where the epiphany regarding the armistice drives a distinct closure action (sealing the wall). The transition from observation to action is earned, and the cost of the card is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where the inciting shortage of resources forces escalation and sacrifice. The closure is excellent: a Decisive Change (Lira's disappearance) coupled with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the song teaching the living) that lands with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear inciting incident and rising action via the archive's resistance. The closure lands with a conceptual cost (the vow and the abandoned tool), though the denouement shifts into summary ("trust would return") rather than staying in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where an ancient song instantaneously dissolves deep-seated sociopolitical conflict, bypassing the need for genuine negotiation or sacrifice. The puzzle logic—analyzing ancient adhesive patterns to find coordinates—feels contrived and scientifically implausible, breaking the causal chain with convenient "National Treasure" style mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates short-form scope by summarizing months/years instead of sustaining a single scene; the climax (the constables' arrival) is resolved via evasion off-page ("She was already gone"). Consequently, there is no on-page decisive change or cost paid in the present moment, merely a retrospective account of escape.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic—reading signs to reach a realization—and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure (stepping off the terrace to find the center) lands with genre-appropriate resonance. However, the reliance on backstory to explain the "butterfly effect" slows the middle, and the puzzle-solving progression feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent; the final image of the paper bird creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that answers the opening beat. The "dream logic" of the match and feather is consistent with the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where causality is soft; the resolution (a bird dropping a seed that turns glass to sand) feels like a *deus ex machina* rather than a result of the protagonist's specific agency. While the closure provides a "new path," the mechanics of how Lira's "conjecture" caused the bird to fix the problem remain obscure. The spatial orientation—a geode containing a cliffside path leading to an unseen sea—is somewhat disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is conceptually strong, with Cipher releasing control in a satisfying resonant reconfiguration. However, the central causal chain relies on fragile, cinematic coincidences (flashlight hitting a nostril, specific backstory alignment) that strain literary plausibility under the guise of calculation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure works well for this ritualistic narrative, building pressure through the progression of verses against the sunrise. Closure is strong and resonant, delivering a decisive transformation (fledging words on skin) that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear ritual: observe, interpret, act. While the closure (healing the town) is conceptually complete, the lack of causal complication or "no-going-back" pressure points makes the plot feel inevitable and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear scene leading to a tangible closure unit (the ash-to-ink ritual). The "reflecting deeply" bridge is a weak transition that summarizes rather than dramatizes the pivotal realization, but the final physical action and the decision to visit the survivors' group provide a strong, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, ritualistic structure (Lens: Accumulative) that remains legible and focused on the revitalization process. However, the progression is low-friction; obstacles (like the "impossible" entry of the balloon) resolve immediately without tactical adjustment or failure, reducing the plot to a linear procedural. The cyclical closure works conceptually but lacks dramatic weight because the initial success felt inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structural pivot revealing the building as a camera is brilliant, and the closure effectively consumes the protagonist. However, the coda's phrasing feels mechanical and lowers the resonance of the final conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal lens with effective escalation through the three mirrors, culminating in a decisive closure where a sacrifice alters the world's logic. The cost is legible and the resolution feels earned. The "rule of three" structure is efficient, if slightly standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot is driven by magical convenience rather than character agency; the terrace "responds" and the crowd is "drawn" by the ritual's pull, solving the central problem externally. The closure relies on a spectacle of light rather than a causally earned shift in human dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tight, linking the backstory (manufactured drought) directly to the climax (the lull required for the egg). The closure is decisive and conceptually rich, with the destruction of the map and the internalization of the echo creating a lasting, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a decisive closure where the protagonist reconfigures her role from servant to leader. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, though the "mad weaver" backstory feels slightly convenient as a tool source.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from retreat to ritual to resolution. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration where he accepts a new artistic stance. The reliance on the magic stick to deliver the backstory and insight reduces the sense of active protagonist agency, but the structural logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, building from the ascent to the construction and final release. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical structure is traded for a spiritual weight—lands effectively within the established magical realist logic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is seamless, with a clear inciting task (entering the sanctum) and a resonant climax (the rope lifting). The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where preservation shifts from static bronze to moving water—lands with earned conceptual weight. The logic of the magic system is taught efficiently through action without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative operates on coherent dream logic (Associative/Lyric lens), moving from ritual to transformation with a clear final image. While the causality is soft, the closure—the bunker blooming—provides resonant reconfiguration, though the connection between the "lens" and the "storm" relies heavily on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving effectively from the inciting pressure of dusk to the resolution at dawn. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transcends into a guardian spirit—is earned by the established genre logic. The transition to the herald’s perspective provides a classic fable-like distance that suits the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Situational drive is effectively managed, with the sanctuary’s "demand for balance" forcing a clear climax. Closure lands as a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (leaving the box for the next user), ensuring the narrative logic holds from the inciting entry to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is flawless under a mythic lens, moving from a failed mechanical attempt to a successful visceral sacrifice. The closure is decisive and resonant, with the restoration of the orchard and the sextant's repair serving as a tangible reconfiguration of the story's world.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative shifts from a grounded scene into a summarized life-history ("Years later..."), diffusing the tension of the graft. The causal link between the "breach" and the solution is smoothed over by convenient magical items.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the bathroom as a functional pivot point between the orchard's pressure and the protagonist's breakthroughs. Closure acts as a definitive Conceptual Repricing: Mara's surrender to the "Index" recontextualizes her existence with undeniable ontological cost. The surreal logic remains consistent, adhering strictly to the rules of nonlinear inheritance established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving cleanly from the traveler's arrival to the library's breach and the final release of "absences." The closure—planting mistakes as second thoughts—is a strong Conceptual Repricing. The mechanics of the rescue (crushing an illustration to break a comma) rely on a dream logic that risks feeling arbitrary, even within the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative logic holds until the ending, where causality blurs excessively; the protagonist stands "buoyant" on the roof, yet the next paragraph states only a lily remains, creating a confusing contradiction regarding her survival or metamorphosis. The narrative relies on dream logic that sometimes bypasses necessary causal connective tissue between the card's heat and the memory retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative traces a clear, linear ritual enactment with a coherent beginning, middle, and end. The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing—time now contains the missing village—but the progression is low-tension, relying on procedural steps rather than causal pressure or complications.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and the closure (silencing the beings) is a clear Decisive Change. However, the encounter with the Warden lacks friction or cost—he is bypassed instantly with a magic image—which flattens the rising action and makes the obstacle course feel procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative structure relies on a heavy summary for the central action (the seven-day journey), compressing what should be the rising action into two sentences of exposition. This dissolves the tension between the incite (missing shard) and the climax (restoration), making the resolution feel unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situational drive where the storm’s pressure forces a stance crystallization. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist synthesizes a new form of existence, paying a clear cost (emptying herself) to create the seed. The pivot from "conjecture" to the tactile act of sculpting is a satisfying causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, and the trade with Jax provides strong causal footing for the climax. However, the sentry scene relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the dust) that lacks setup, weakening the causal chain leading to the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structural integrity is excellent, utilizing the "pause in conversation" to frame a cohesive scene with clear temporal anchors. The narrative drive holds the Textural lens firmly, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration closure that feels earned by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured, moving efficiently from the inciting inversion to a resonant closure. The causality of the climb—collecting, trading, releasing—is clear and logical within the fable's rules. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the return to the bunker is altered by her internal change, satisfying the closure requirement with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clean, ritualistic arc (Situational lens) that moves logically from boarding to test to release. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis, reinforcing Nilo's cyclical duty, though the progression feels somewhat expected.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (The Causal Lens), and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure (throne as responsibility, not power) is legible. However, the progression is frictionless; obstacles like the door mechanism are solved instantly with equipment, robbing the climax of narrative tension. The orientation is solid, but the plot lacks a meaningful turning point where the outcome was in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scene follows a clear causal arc, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a coherent before/after state. However, the inciting incident and resolution occur too easily; the boy accepts the keeper's paradoxical logic ("suffocate to breathe") without the friction or failed attempt that would earn the breakthrough. The narrative structure is sound but moves too efficiently from problem to solution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is outstanding; the diamond toss creates a definitive "after" state with clear conceptual repricing (liberation over wealth) and a settled reality. The causal chain is tight, moving from the glitch-text inciting incident to the climax without wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is complete and the closure—Arin reading the truth to the city—is decisive. However, causality is weakened by the convenience of the "bridge of intuition" guiding him directly to the hidden handle, removing the friction of the search. The Muse's appearance functions as a gatekeeper but feels disjointed from the established reality, acting more as a prompt insertion than an organic plot driver.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is exemplary, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the "crease" of possibility, effectively reweighting the entire narrative premise. The causal chain is tight, with the dance leading directly to the trade, and the ending delivers a profound conceptual cost that echoes the opening stakes perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting find to a decisive, resonant closure (placing the button in the file). The structure effectively utilizes the single setting. The closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing, re-weighting a piece of "waste" as a vital anchor, with the clear cost of violating archival protocol for the sake of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is undermined by magical logic (puddles displaying signal frequencies) and implausible tech (wiring a 1990s phone booth directly to a city-wide emergency broadcast tower). The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction," where the antagonists are instantly neutralized by the broadcast without Mira paying a commensurate cost or facing a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a Situational lens, moving from the initial pressure of the dawn to the climax of the prophecy speaking, and resolving into a resonant Earned Stasis. The causal logic of music countering prophecy is established early and paid off with the "erasure" mechanic at the end. Closure is definitive yet costly, maintaining the cycle without feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on significant summary and montage ("Word spread... other sorters lent seeds") that violates the short-story scope of immediate scene work. The climax on the "seventh dawn" feels structurally arbitrary rather than causally inevitable. The resolution is convenient, solving the gravity problem with a "mirror world" concept that lacks established setup.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (leaves) to the descent and discovery. The closure—a decisive departure into legend—lands with conceptual weight, though the shift to summary ("Years later") slightly diffuses the immediate scenic tension of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, utilizing the four "limits" to pace the ritual effectively. Causality follows a coherent magical logic (grief + material = gold), and the closure (rejoining the search with a new mindset) lands clearly. The progression is somewhat linear and procedural, lacking unexpected turns, but it fulfills the promise of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear causal chain (procedure -> obstacle -> distinct tool use -> success). The closure is valid (task completion, healing), but the arc lacks complication; the solution works exactly as intended on the first try with the harp, making the progression feel like a vignette rather than a story with narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative drive, using the discovery of three “equations” to structure the narrative ascent effectively. Closure is achieved through a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the realization that forgiveness is asymptotic creates a lasting conceptual cost, and the physical act of discarding the strap seals the arc with finality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The time-loop structure is executed with precision, creating a coherent narrative circle that feels complete. The closure—renouncing the role of translator and the object—lands with a clear status shift. The orientation within the market and the transition into the painting are handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative creates a coherent situational loop that resolves with a clear decisive change—abandoning the barrel. The logic of the time-slip is handled efficiently, creating adequate pressure for the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain from the frost-reading to the final rupture, with no wasted motion or scenic drift. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist steps into the chaos he engineered—lands with clear conceptual and physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a strong Accumulative logic, where the density of the mirror-covering ritual builds the necessary charge for the climax. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist is consumed, but the world is re-seeded. The pacing is excellent, though the archaeologist's immediate conversion by the light is a slightly rapid resolution to the external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with negligible cost; the "covenant" accepts the first offer made, and the city is saved instantly. The closure brings total restoration without the "felt or conceptual cost" required for high-band literary fiction, reading more like a fable with a guaranteed outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing dream logic that remains internally consistent; the causality of the compass leading to the cliff and the subsequent vision follows a clear trajectory. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist physically and metaphysically alters the world state. A slightly longer buildup to the "delve" could have heightened the anticipation, but the economy is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality follows a clear dream-logic coherence; the closure is excellent, offering a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the drowned GPS (cost) trades safety for the "unmarked map" (truth).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative structure tracks the season effectively, and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure (understanding the dark) lands logically within the story's fable-like rules. However, the narrative relies on summary to bridge months, and the lack of concrete causality regarding the "grief" subplot weakens the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally rigorous; the lagoon's trap forces a clear negotiation that drives the protagonist to a Decisive Change. The trade-off (future for truth) is established early and paid off in the climax, leading to a closure that permanently alters the world state (unerasable names) with visible social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the burning ritual); the refusal of the bottle’s comfort creates a decisive, irreversible change in the town’s state that satisfies the "integrity of endings."

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative loop is elegant, utilizing the water immersion to trigger a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist realizes he is the source of the prophecy. The causality follows a dream-logic consistent with the genre, and the closure—accepting the internal "hum" to replace the foghorn—lands with significant conceptual cost. The structure efficiently moves from inciting object to climactic realization within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal/Situational hybrid lens. The inciting incident (egg hatching) flows logically into the ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist physically alters the flow of time. The closure is distinct and definitive; the cost of restarting history is paid on the page through the splitting of the bead and the fracturing of the acorn cap.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, with clear orientation and a distinct climax at the bell ringing. Closure lands with a successful reconfiguration of her role, but the lack of tangible cost—the city conveniently ignores the anomaly—softens the impact. The resolution feels slightly too safe, lacking a "bitten" price for her unauthorized action.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fable-like structure progresses logically to a decisive closure where the protagonist leaves the lantern behind. Orientation is effective, though the "years later" epilogue distances the reader slightly from the immediate cost of the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands with a distinct physical act (sealing the fracture) that satisfies the need for a decisive change. However, the narrative relies on a dream sequence to convey the stakes of the fracture, bypassing dramatized causality in favor of a convenient information dump.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure forms a coherent fable with a distinct beginning, middle, and end; the discovery of the capsule naturally leads to the climax at the market. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing, where the trade of the urn reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to time. The arrival of the truck is a mild coincidence that serves the theme, accepted here under fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on coincidence (the kite appearing exactly when the string is tuned) and symbolic convenience rather than earned causality. The closure is didactic; writing the theme in the sand ("Incomplete is the only doorway...") acts as a summary rather than a dramatic reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story masterfully employs a mosaic structure to cover the six-month timeline, utilizing a consistent Accumulative drive lens that builds toward a clear, resonant closure. The final "signing" of the treaty serves as a Decisive Change that reconfigures the world with a legible conceptual and physical cost (her departure/death).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is excellent, delivering a "Conceptual Repricing" where the map (amber) becomes a record (fossil). The physical collapse of the tower effectively externalizes the cost of the realization, satisfying the drive lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    A coherent Accumulative arc where a ritual is enacted to completion, landing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the landscape. While structurally sound, the causality is frictionless—the magic works instantly without complication—which limits narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The climax relies on unearned "dream logic" where pressing a wax leaf against a phonograph causes the needle to carve specific coordinates. This mechanical leap lacks established rules, functioning as a convenient shortcut to resolve the central mystery without trial or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative flow is smooth, and the inciting incident (anniversary/compass) transitions clearly into the climax. However, the shift from grounded sci-fi to explicit magical realism (the "pocket where grief could be temporally stretched") feels like a convenient conceptual leap rather than a causal payoff. The "Years later" coda distances the reader from the closure beat, summarizing the aftermath instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving cleanly from the inciting climb to the decisive closure of the game and the tower’s collapse. The "dream logic" causality (a secret's gravity tilting the board) works beautifully within the established magical realist frame. The closure is distinct and earned, with a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the status quo as Halcyon is liberated and the cycle continues.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The arc is elegant, utilizing the "interregnum" as a pressure cooker that validates the sudden intimacy of the encounter. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gallery becomes a temporary sanctuary, the ending landing with the felt cost of the inevitable dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight and compelling, moving from a clear objective to a necessary confrontation and a decisive resolution. Closure is achieved through a distinct act of renunciation that permanently alters the character's state and relationship to her world. The logic of the magic system supports the climax without feeling like a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magical realist causality holds together well; the external unfreezing creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration matched to the internal release. The pivot point relies heavily on a sudden intellectual decoding of the tapestry, which feels slightly convenient, but the "righting of the king" provides a concrete, earned closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is taut, leveraging the deadline effectively to force a climax. Closure is exemplary: the mechanics of the world (echoes, spire) yield a tangible result (the feather, the crack) that physically embodies the internal change (Resonant Reconfiguration). The ending creates a legible "after" state with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is exceptionally tight, using the "breath holding" constraint to pace the rising action perfectly within the word count. The causality is stark: completing the ritual (agency) directly causes the workshop's destruction (cost), delivering a classic and powerful Decisive Change. The ending lands with absolute clarity under the Causal lens, ensuring the trade-off is felt rather than just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is solid, anchored by a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure where the art is transferred rather than kept. The inciting incident (mirror crack) and resolution are causally strong, though the midpoint relies on the coincidental/magical discovery of the shell, which slightly strains the Causal lens until the ending re-grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but a prop continuity error—the cork is set on the railing, then appears in the garden without retrieval—disrupts the physical logic. The climax relies on magical causality that feels slightly convenient, validating the protagonist's belief without a rigorous test of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the escalating phone calls, creating a flawless causal chain that leads to a definitive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The logic of the ritual is established early and paid off without deviation, and the ending—where she becomes the geography—satisfies the premise of "reverse migration" with profound conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the goal (from curing to carrying) lands with visible, felt cost. The accidental spilling of the spoon complicates rather than resolves, forcing an active choice to consume the mud.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, moving from the inciting "gap" to a Decisive Change that feels inevitable yet surprising. The time-loop logic is taught efficiently through the reflection beat, and the closure—repaying the debt with personal memory—lands with distinct, irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B structure with little complication or resistance; the protagonist finds a clue, follows it, and enters a door without significant obstacle. While the closure is a Decisive Change, it feels unearned because the cost (leaving a life he already disliked) is minimal. The pacing is smooth but lacks a "deepening" beat where the character must struggle or adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative loop serves as a tight, effective causal structure, and the closure—donning the crown to become the warning—is a decisive change with clear cost. The circular causality is handled without confusion, providing a satisfying, resonant ending that fulfills the "Resonant Reconfiguration" requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, with a clear inciting arrival and a decisive closure act (crushing the sphere) that validates the Conceptual Repricing. The causality holds firmly under the hybrid lens, though the "time behaves differently" interjection briefly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure deftly manages the time-loop mechanics without confusing the reader, using the scroll as a tangible anchor for the chronology. The ending provides excellent Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of erasure is a decisive functional closing beat that recontextualizes her relationship to time. The sequence from the cabin to the grave and back to the snow creates a coherent, closed loop that satisfies the premise. The pacing creates a dreamlike inevitability that suits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc successfully reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Mira's relationship with her loss. The plot's pivot, however, relies entirely on an internal assertion of truth regarding the screw's origin without on-page evidentiary support, making the climax feel interpretively loose rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, with the magical mechanics (timing the rune to the kettle’s steam) creating precise causal stakes. Closure is exemplary: the breaking of the quill and the rising of the rock provide a distinct Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration of the burden she carried.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the admission of fault ("I was wrong") pays the emotional cost and resolves the spectral tension. The causal chain is generally tight, though the "induced currents" guiding her hand to the specific file feels slightly convenient (Deus Ex Machina) within the established magic system. The ending image of the lilac blooming out of season beautifully anchors the "imperfect miracle" logic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dream-logic consistency is strong, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration into "pure notation") lands effectively. The narrative arc is a linear enactment of a ritual, which works for the genre but feels slightly pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The surreal logic is consistent, effectively using the "water flowing uphill" anomaly to trigger the reversal. The narrative arc from observation to active intervention (winding the clock) to transcendence is clear and structurally sound. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Torvald becomes the "space between"—is a strong, decisive shift in state.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from investigation to metaphysical resolution. The closure—a "collapsing superposition" that resolves grief—is emotionally resonant and structurally sound. The mechanism of the resolution (guiding duplicates into a spiral with a laser pointer) requires a suspension of disbelief that leans heavily on poetic logic over strict causality, but it fits the story's dreamlike physics.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands with a clear Reconfiguration, but the causal link between generic "subway scrawls" and the specific "library basement" relies on dream logic rather than established ground rules. The middle section dissolves into a summary montage, reducing scenic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loop structure is established early and broken decisively at the climax, satisfying the causal drive lens. The temporal twist (child becomes woman) justifies the surreal logic without breaking the story's internal rules. Closure is excellent: the decision to cut the wires and hand off the disc constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is solid, utilizing a two-shard mosaic (jetty scene + home coda) that effectively delivers closure. The "relocation" of the locket provides a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the status quo. The narrative arc from sketching to burial to the empty wrist at the piano is cohesive and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, and the closure (departure) is earned by the premise. However, the reliance on a montage bridge ("Word spread... They came...") to handle the escalation weakens the causal density, substituting summary for dramatized scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc to a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the climax is driven by the object (ring releases) rather than protagonist agency. The resolution—becoming the map—is distinct, but the lack of causal friction or obstacles makes the journey feel somewhat automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent "problem-action-result" structure with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the "magic fix" nature of the pen slightly undercuts the causal weight, making the resolution feel more like a soft reset than a paid-for change.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure forms a clear, linear vignette (arrival, ritual, departure) with legible closure, but the narrative relies on magical fiat rather than causal linkage; obstacles are nonexistent, and the resolution is an inevitable outcome of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no meaningful obstacles; the protagonist enters, finds the object immediately, and leaves. The climax relies on magical convenience (the tapestry changing faces, the archive spontaneously collapsing) rather than causal logic or character agency. The closure is a "mission accomplished" summary that explains the theme rather than dramatizing a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the "universe inhaling" as a temporal constraint that times the closure. The shift from "fugitive" to "conductor" provides a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts a new role with the legible conceptual cost of permanent entanglement.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting incident to a clear resolution via a Resonant Reconfiguration (the labyrinth as an acoustic machine). The causality is generally strong, though the logic of the "maintenance challenge" working on a sealed, secret door relies slightly on "video game logic" where items and lore combine too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the darkness changes its nature. The closure lands with conceptual weight, though the orientation regarding the "half-spoken secret" is abstract rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative operates on dream logic rather than causality; the jump from finding the grotto to organizing synchronized window displays feels arbitrary and disconnected from the inciting trigger. The climax (the gathering) resolves without obstacles, lacking a decisive turning point where the protagonist risks failure. The story moves primarily through atmospheric shifts rather than causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream logic (Situational/Causal hybrid) that sustains the magical realism premise. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (island to raft city) with visible cost (loss of stable ground, sacrifice of the scrimshaw). The pacing is linear, moving directly from problem to solution without significant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from performative detachment to a grounded resonant reconfiguration (planting the stems) with visible emotional cost. The closure is excellent, offering a "performance suspended" beat that feels definitive. A slight wobble occurs with the talking crow; in a gritty dystopian setting, this sudden fable-like element feels like a genre breach that muddies the otherwise grounded causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive logic of "soft magic" where sound influences reality, leading to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing closure where law becomes environment. The trajectory is linear and procedural, lacking a significant setback or reversal to heighten the narrative drive, but the closure lands with legible conceptual cost (self-erasure).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story relies heavily on summary montage ("For three days," "Years later") which dilutes the immediate pressure of the 600-800 word scope. While the closure—returning the eye and choosing imperfection—is resonant, the "years later" epilogue dissipates the tension of the scene rather than letting the final image carry the weight. The structure feels more like a compressed novel synopsis than a tightly wound short story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the story has a legible beginning, middle, and end, the climax relies on weak causality where a single rhetorical question instantly resolves the central conflict. The resolution feels like a "soft reset" rather than an earned turn, as the antagonists abandon their life's work without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible ritual structure that leads to a clear Decisive Change (leaving the observatory). The destruction of the stencil provides a tangible cost for the closure, though the progression feels somewhat processional and lacking in causal friction until that final act.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an Accumulative lens, building pressure through the ritual until the "fractal of leveraged debt" realization. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: the map reveals an infinite regression, and the sealing of the tin serves as a decisive, resonant exit.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality operates on dream logic; the solution to the central conflict (walking backward to find a hidden door) is a symbolic convenience lacking established setup. The resolution is unearned by the narrative mechanics, relying on a deus ex machina realization that solves the physical imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a defined beginning, middle, and end, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist alters her state of being. The causality is associative and dream-logic based, which fits the genre, though the mechanism of the "shadow unbound" manifesting remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving cleanly from inciting shame to ritual reconstruction and release. A distinct continuity error disrupts the climax: five dead lizards are established, yet Miren sets "six ivory fragments" in the circle without a source for the sixth, undermining the precision of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a grounded waking state into a surreal, high-stakes trade, and back to a changed reality. The transition via the coffee rings is logically risky but earned by the established telepathy/serum premise. Closure is decisive: the "miracle" is internalized, and the wound's meaning is recontextualized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a legible magical-realist logic, but agency falters at the climax when the film threads itself and the screen brightens automatically. The resolution relies on a soft magic system that solves the central emotional problem without exacting a tangible cost or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Situational" drive, moving from the arrival at the archway to the reception of the message and the final transformation. The closure creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost—the dissolution of the self—logic that holds up well within the story's established dream-reality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc with a distinct closure unit (planting the clock to release the children). The logic of the surrealism holds together, and the final beat delivers a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of the sacrificed artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear quest logic that fits the fable mode, leading to a distinct physiological transformation. The climax, however, rushes through multiple locations (shore, metro, forest) in rapid succession, creating a spatial flicker that muddles the cause-and-effect of the final return.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the resolution is a "soft reset" achieved by a magical gesture (the stamp) rather than a hard choice. The ending lacks closure cost; the hound simply returns to duty, erasing the crisis without lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building pressure through the surgery scene to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the bolt transfer. Closure is earned and distinct, with the final image successfully reweighting the silence constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot is linear and lacks a decisive change driven by pressure; the resolution relies on a magical object functioning perfectly without cost. The "guards burst in" moment is a false complication diffused instantly by a gesture, leaving the closure feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on significant contrivances that break suspension of disbelief: a randomly torn paper page fitting a pre-carved stone slot is video-game logic that harms the story's reality. Additionally, the protagonist's private habit inextricably matching an external ancient lock is a causality shortcut that resolves the central mystery through luck.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on dream logic (sunlight on rust ignites engines) rather than earned causality, and the text terminates abruptly mid-sentence, failing the fundamental requirement for on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    The plot hinges on a significant coincidence—the kite blowing to her feet with the exact necessary code—which undercuts agency. While closure is achieved, the causal chain is weak because the solution to the central puzzle arrives by luck rather than character effort.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, using the walk as a frame for the internal journey. The closure—sealing the photo in resin—is a strong, tangible Resonant Reconfiguration (RR). The "new covenant" speech slightly over-explains the resolution, softening the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid with a distinct Inciting Incident, Rising Action, and Climax. Closure (Decisive Change) is achieved as he steps through the mirror, paying the ultimate cost (reality/life) for his art.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands with a Decisive Change as Kael enters the portal, but the setup relies on the convenient mechanics of the ink, which acts as a magical solution rather than a tool with established limits. The explanation of the anomaly is delivered through expository dialogue and journal entries rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a valid Decisive Change with the upload and re-freeze. However, causality is strained by the convenience of "secretly kept alive" wires functioning perfectly after decades of unmaintained dormancy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scene is a coherent vignette with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the graft taking hold), but it lacks causal propulsion. The narrative follows a procedural linearity (intention -> action -> result) without an obstacle or "turn" that threatens the outcome, reducing the ending's earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and mythic logic holds firm; the inciting threat (burning the garden) forces a decisive change in tactics. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—divinity redefined as conversation—earned by the specific action of the rail spike, with the drive lens (Causal) holding clearly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from inciting incident to a climactic "proof" that alters reality. The closure is decisive and resonant, utilizing the established magic system to deliver a satisfying reconfiguration of the protagonist's world without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight, with a clear causal chain from the tethering to the translation to the trap. The twist regarding the lab's predatory nature effectively raises the stakes, and the closure (release/empty amber) lands with a distinct change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, following a clear ritualistic structure that leads to a resonant closure. Causality follows the story's dream logic consistently. The ending—destroying the mandala and the tile—provides a legible Decisive Change with material cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, using the ritual of mosaic-making to earn a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the shift to a zoomed-out, fable-like summary at the end ("She spent her remaining years...") distances the reader from the immediate consequences of the night's work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a flawless accumulative structure where the ritualistic steps create a sturdy causal chain leading to a resonant closure. The transition from the "real" theater to the memory garden and back is handled with seamless logic that supports the story's metaphysical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers from a "magical science" causality break where ephemeral light paintings inexplicably transform into physical jewelry discs without logic or process. The ending dissolves into a summary of months of success ("helped dozens, then hundreds"), violating the requirement for an on-page closure scene with felt cost. The climax is a montage, not a dramatic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from exploration to a decisive interaction (the heat inversion) and a resonant closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration of the staff into a beacon provides a solid ending, though the "instant" nature of the magical solution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (Collect Buttons → Epiphany → Return) with minimal causal complication or setback. While the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of prophecy into possibility—is legible, the lack of obstacles or failure during the "unscrambling" process lowers the narrative drive. The logic is dream-like, which fits the tone, but the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causality suffers from a significant logic gap regarding the "codes in accumulated snow": the protagonist brushes away the snow to find a slate, yet supposedly reads a snow-based cipher that would have been destroyed by that action or melted years ago. This physical contradiction undermines the pivotal discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative logic holds together beautifully within its dream-logic frame, moving cleanly from the ticking clock to the transformation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost of the crossing—his collected life's work—is paid on the page and physically embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (arrival, ritual, success, departure) with soft, dream-like causality. While the closure is legible as a resonant reconfiguration, the lack of obstacles or causal pivots makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality is solid, fitting the vignette scope. However, the progression is linear with minimal friction; the obstacle (the locked door) is overcome immediately with the stolen tool, lacking a moment of doubt or complication to heighten the narrative drive. Closure lands clearly with a resonant reconfiguration of the boy’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear Inciting Incident (the circle throbbing) and a Decisive Change at the climax (choosing "Alone"). The closure image—using the shadow as a stylus to reclaim the concept of loneliness—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that visually pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, utilizing a ritualistic structure that fits the magical realism genre. Closure is achieved through a clear Conceptual Repricing ("I am here"), though the "magic" of the temple resolves the internal conflict with minimal resistance or complication, softening the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting signal to the escalation of "frequency hops" and the final tactical shift. Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration that recontextualizes the central action ("interference") with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight, coherent causal chain driven by the established "spatial mutiny" logic. The closure—a Decisive Change where the tunnels seal to open the archives—lands with clear conceptual cost and resolves the central tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (the detective’s reaction) lands with emotional weight. The climactic mechanism—smearing blood on hair to instantly unlock a 36-year-repressed memory—strains credibility slightly within the story's otherwise grounded "cold case" frame, acting as a magical realism shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing weeks of action (“Night after night,” “fourteenth squall,” “stay another season”) rather than sustaining a continuous scene or distinct shards. This synopsis-like structure distances the reader from the pivotal moments, reducing the inciting incident and climax to brief mentions rather than lived events.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative operates on a "Lyric" drive where music alters reality, which is executed with consistency. However, the causality relies on convenient magical connections—specifically the "scaffold wrap language" appearing exactly when needed to solve the mystery. The closure (dissolving into song) is resonant but leans heavily on dream logic rather than earned narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structural arc is sound, moving from stasis to a shared ritual and finally to a resonant departure. The closure—trading relics and choosing opposite paths—lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The "spiral" ritual serves as a solid beat to manifest the internal change, though the meeting relies on a high degree of coincidence acceptable for this situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality relies entirely on dream logic and symbolic association rather than narrative mechanics; the "healing" of the brass telescope is a non-sequitur magic fix. The resolution arrives via a "dawn of understanding" that acts as a Deus Ex Machina, removing obstacles without requiring tactical shifts or genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Strong causal logic under a situational/hybrid lens; the mirror's refusal forces the spoken confession, leading to a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration of the vortex's motion.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ritual trajectory is clear, moving from entry to test to sacrifice with strong causality under dream-logic rules. The closure is a distinct Decisive Change (grafting) with visible cost, though the mid-scene flashback drags the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong: desire leads to a specific high-cost trade, which results in an unexpected but logical consequence (cold silence). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist isn't "fixed" but changed, with the lost memory externalized into the setting. The ending feels earned, though the final explanatory realization slightly softens the impact of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence: finding a photo of his specific band with a poetic instruction ("return the sound") in a random quarry trailer 15 years later. This deus ex machina undermines the causal chain, making the resolution feel lucky rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual preparation to a surreal climax and a conceptual resolution. The logic of the world (grammar as physics) is established early, allowing the magical resolution to feel earned rather than convenient. The closure is a distinct Conceptual Repricing, though the resolution comes somewhat smoothly via the spirit's assistance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic where the ritual (smelting identities) serves as a clear causal spine. The closure is strong: planting the creel creates a "Decisive Change" with visible material results (roots) and a felt personal cost (emptiness), effectively anchoring the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to transfiguration with a Decisive Change that is paid for on the page. The closure is resonant, transforming the protagonist's state and purpose with a legible, permanent cost to her former life.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving from a clear inciting state (withdrawal/quest) to a decisive physical closure (the release of the bellows). The drive lens (Accumulative turning Causal) holds firm, and the closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of her purpose. The discovery of the stairs feels slightly convenient, but the subsequent ritual earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the narrative arc leads to a legible closure (becoming the library), the progression relies on repetitive transition phrases ("Through propagation delays") rather than organic causality. The logic of the "confidence man's watch" affecting gravity is stated but not dramatized with clear cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Decisive Change) is resonant, with the melting violin serving as a clear cost. The coffee stain divination functions effectively as a reveal mechanism, though its sudden introduction and immediate success feel slightly convenient (situational) for a provenance researcher.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc leading to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's state changes permanently. The closure is strong and earned by the ritual, though the pivot relies on a sudden epiphany ("saw her own face") rather than a forced tactical choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution of a specific financial problem (treasury debt) via a magical sound is a disconnect in causality that lowers the narrative cost. The logic operates on dream rules (hairpin sap heals lifelines) that distance the reader from the grounded stakes established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from professional routine to moral disruption. Closure is definitive—a Resonant Reconfiguration where certainty is exchanged for doubt—with a legible cost (forfeited payment). The grade is capped by the ending, which relies on explanatory narration to summarize the resolution rather than trusting the image of the unhooked certainty alone.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight, with the four rings providing a clear escalation sequence that leads to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The loop closure is satisfying and earned by the established logic of the pond.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a static Accumulative path where the protagonist arrives, realizes, and transcends without causal struggle or obstacles. Orientation regarding the physical reality of the "bone towers" is vague, relying on atmosphere, and the ending is an unearned epiphany rather than a consequence of action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is exemplary; the "partial solution" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's status from failing mage to uncredentialed guardian, fully satisfying the drive lens. The causal chain is tight, with the environment (sealing air) providing organic pressure that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic causality suited to the genre, with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the inciting incident relies on a "mysterious stranger" trope that vanishes conveniently, and the progression is a linear sequence of unlocking rather than a tightening noose of consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc creates a distinct, complete movement from investigation to transfiguration. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the protagonist into a new form with a clear, on-page physical cost that satisfies the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is decisive and resonant; the destruction of the cylinders to rewrite the map is a tangible action that cements the internal shift. The magical logic (ink reacting to frost, roof melting) remains consistent within the established mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story violates the single-scene scope by utilizing a massive time jump ("Years passed") to resolve the plot, shifting from dramatization to biography. This structural choice dissipates the accumulation of pressure established in the first half and renders the closure—while conceptually resonant—emotionally distant because the final cost is summarized rather than paid in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central plot device—paper photographs clipped to a fishing line surviving twenty-five years of submersion in a muddy reservoir—shatters physical plausibility. While the "found object" beat is structurally sound, the failure to account for water damage (pulping, fading) in a realistic setting breaks immersion and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and leads to a decisive closure where the protagonist sacrifices the object to gain internal transformation. The use of starlings to provide specific coordinates feels convenient (a magic solution to a search problem), weakening the causal chain in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands with a legible shift in ritual (tallying releases), but the structure relies on a "test" logic explained explicitly by the dead instructor via radio. This "explain-everything" beat dissolves the narrative ambiguity and causality into a contrived lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The custody ritual provides a tight structural frame with clear causality, and the "rewrite" mechanic effectively functions as a ticking clock that forces the decisive Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of threat-compliance-success without a crisis point or moment of genuine doubt. The ending relies on a summative explanation of the theme rather than a dramatized structural turn. The closure is a "happy ending" realization that lacks the requisite felt cost or sacrifice to earn the "covenant."

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is distinct with a clear resonant reconfiguration at closure ("new silence"). The resolution leans on a magical realist turn that is effective but resolves the central conflict with relatively low tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, adhering to a clear situational lens that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—choosing to remain in the frozen garden and leaving the pendant—is an earned renunciation with visible cost, effectively resolving the tension without forcing a tidy happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is solid, moving from ritual preparation to a decisive transformation and departure. Orientation is clear, and the closure (Decisive Change) lands with a legible cost, though the "penny drops" timing feels mechanically inserted rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the climax relies on a soft magic fix where changing a mindset instantly resolves the physical threat. The lack of causal friction or setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal loop involving the radio warning is executed cleanly, providing a satisfying "key" to the problem. The climax logic—where the constraint is to "choose" a timeline, but the action is "merging"—wobbles slightly on the specific mechanics of the cost, but the emotional closure is decisive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic appropriate for a dream sequence, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing closure ("connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed"). However, the progression relies on repetitive structural beats (action, shifting environment, realization) rather than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with exceptional clarity; the physical exchange of the chain link serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the instructor's purpose. The causal chain from the lesson to the boy's question to the lighthouse vigil is seamless. The structure supports the emotional weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is solid, leading from discovery to investigation to confrontation. However, the climax relies on a convenient off-page "upload" that deflates the physical tension, and the antagonist's immediate medical collapse acts as a deus ex machina to resolve the conflict without a final hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the facility repairs itself "like a film played backward," dissolving the crisis without ingenuity or sacrifice. The gold fleck functions as a deus ex machina that solves every physical and metaphysical obstacle, flattening the causal chain into a sequence of successful actions.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    The surreal logic holds together well under a Hybrid lens, with the “defragmentation” serving as a compelling, if abstract, rising action. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration that creates emotional solidity, though the transition from ghost to flesh relies heavily on dream-logic mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from the inciting death of the language to the protagonist's sacrificial preservation of it. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the vessel for the language—lands with undeniable permanence and cost. The pacing of the transformation in the tunnel is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The surreal causality works well within the story's dream logic, and the closure is decisive and legible. However, the initial setup—the "soil chemist" cover and the university mission—is discarded too quickly to generate narrative traction before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic, but the moment of "understanding arrived too late" creates a false beat of tension that is immediately resolved without consequence. The resolution relies on a convenient magical reconfiguration (gold dust writing instructions) rather than a hard-won structural turn, making the closure feel like a smooth descent rather than a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain (bottle to game to key to letters) is solid, and the trade-off (storm for words) is clear. However, the resolution of the external threat—guards lowering rifles due to "healing rain"—is unearned sentimentality that softens the closure's impact and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a valid Accumulative structure, accumulating imagery until the release at the oasis. However, the transition through the "warped corridor" feels telescoped and outline-like, resolving a major navigational obstacle in a single sentence. Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing—silence is reweighted as potential music—though the causality follows dream logic rather than concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (a night on the job) rather than a causal story; there is no inciting incident that disrupts the status quo or forces a difficult decision. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist succeeds perfectly with no visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and provides a clear resolution, but the causality operates on low-friction dream logic where success feels inevitable. The required closure cost is largely aesthetic ("airy saturation") rather than a felt sacrifice, weakening the impact of the ending's reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Excellent causal thread with a distinct Decisive Change (absorption of the cub, physical scar) and legible cost (loss of name). The fable logic is consistent and the structural orientation remains clear despite the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the gatepost to the decisive cut of the mushroom. The climax (slicing the stalk) is a tactile, specific action that earns the resolution. Closure is firm, with the final journal entry providing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the initial loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "reversible exile" mechanic provides a strong causal spine, and the loop closure creates a satisfying conceptual reconfiguration of the story's rules. However, the "seven times" ritual that executes this rewrite feels slightly convenient—a sudden magical solution introduced at the climax rather than a capability derived from established rules earlier in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear fable logic with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (hoarding shifts to sharing). While the causal chain is intact, the resolution relies on a sudden, convenient epiphany and high-magic mechanics ("grafting onto air") that lower the sense of grounded stakes. The closure is distinct, but the cost (losing the loom) feels planned rather than forced by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible beginning, middle, and end, satisfying the basic structural requirements. However, the progression is accumulative without significant causal surprises or reversals; the "problem" of the knot is solved by simply applying the tool until it works. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but it feels structurally predictable rather than earned through narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative relies on poetic association—the coincidental alignment of a map tear with a shadow—to trigger the resolution, rather than strict causal pressure. While the "Conceptual Repricing" closure works well for the genre, the pivot point feels slightly contrived as a "god from the machine" epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear before/after state. However, the turning point relies heavily on a magical realization triggered by the secondary character rather than strict causal pressure, which softens the dramatic tension of the "variables refusing to balance."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the city receiving the message) is resonant, but the climax relies on soft magic logic where a simple touch resolves the central conflict instantly. The causality feels more poetic than propulsive, with the "echo" functioning as a convenient turn rather than a pressure-tested obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira chooses expansion over ascension—is strong and satisfying. However, the rising action relies heavily on serendipity: the light hitting the goggles at the exact moment to reveal the cipher and the wind physically rearranging pages to open the lock are Deus Ex Machina conveniences that bypass the need for protagonist ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The situational drive (waiting for the cable to snap) creates a tight, coherent narrative arc. The closure lands well via Conceptual Repricing (the "falling star"), recontextualizing the tragedy into a moment of wonder, though the mechanics of the fall are slightly dreamlike.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the demolition deadline to create effective situational pressure. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the completed mural and departure), though the backstory of discovering the code "yesterday" feels slightly convenient for the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution hinges on a convenient world-rule ("light-feed runs on stories") introduced at the climax to match the protagonist's inventory. This *Deus Ex Machina* logic dissolves the problem without cost or causal struggle, failing the closure cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from failure to insight to resolution with clear causality under a hybrid lens. The closure—the door vanishing and the acceptance of the new role—provides a resonant, definitive change in status with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the passing-of-the-torch closure lands cleanly. The climax, however, relies on a montage of "forming chains" and "grandmothers anchoring ropes" rather than a specific, dramatized moment of near-failure, reducing the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's physical form becomes the cost of salvation. However, the pivot point—where she suddenly understands the complex magical method ("She understood then the method")—is a knowledge leap not fully earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with clear orientation and a distinct causal chain: the frost necessitates speed, the deception necessitates a stronger signal, and the nut provides the oil to create it. Closure is excellent, landing an "Earned Stasis" where the protagonist pays a price to maintain the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a "weeks later" transition that elides the causal struggle of the scientific process, leaping from insight directly to success. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the experiment works perfectly, reducing the felt cost of the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative operates on a consistent "dream logic" where the library's physical shifts causally track the vendor's sales. The closure is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing: the vendor removes herself to allow the narrative to nucleate, a cost that is both logical within the established rules and thematically resonant. The arc from transaction to transformation is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the sensory logic of the world is established early. However, the climax relies on a spontaneous development of her ability ("Her gift reversed itself") that wasn't foreshadowed, functioning as a convenient solution to the overwhelming grief. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration of the landscape and her internal state—lands well despite this causality patch.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a legible goal and resolution. However, the causality is softened by convenient magic; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or complications once she decides to act, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or ingenuity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, adhering to a Situational drive lens where a specific window of opportunity (alignment) creates pressure. The closure—a "try/fail" cycle that yields new data (sketches) and physical cost (blood)—feels earned and resonant. The ending relies on the moon moving (an external timer) rather than a protagonist choice to stop, which slightly limits the agency at the very peak, but fits the established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a tight, clock-driven arc with clear causality: entry, harvest, complication, and escape. The "doodle-shaped void" resolution is satisfyingly symmetric but relies on a lock-and-key fit that feels slightly convenient. Closure is achieved through a decisive success (Restoration) rather than a reconfiguration with heavy personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from diagnosis to resonance with a clear Cause-and-Effect drive. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that effectively alters the state of the world, satisfying the premise of breaking the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story functions as a static vignette where a character stands in one spot and thinks until they have a realization. While the orientation is functional, the narrative lacks a causal arc; the closure (a Conceptual Repricing of his exile) arrives via meditation rather than pressure or necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative structure is a linear list of tunings without causal complication or setback; the radio simply yields the frequencies she seeks. Closure arrives via a conceptual realization (clasp as tuning fork) that feels intellectually imposed rather than earned through narrative pressure. The absence of a tangible obstacle flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative flows smoothly as a ritual enactment, but lacks a decisive causal turn where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the character's state, but the absence of a felt price or obstacle flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, framed effectively by the gravity inversion. However, the resolution relies on the convenient fit of the arrow into the stone (destiny logic) rather than a causally earned breakthrough, though the closure is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from survey to discovery to resolution. The internal logic of the "predictive echo" is established quickly and paid off by the protagonist's inversion of her actions, creating a satisfying causal loop. While the epiphany arrives rapidly, the closure (the port exhaling, the protocol changing) is definitive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fetch-quest structure is elevated by a transformative closure where the object is internalized rather than merely retrieved. The logic holds well under a Causal lens, though the obstacles (Vein, Slab) yield somewhat easily to the protagonist's specific powers without forcing a harder tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is strong, featuring a clear renunciation with visible cost (leaving the flute). However, the causality relies on a magical convenience—the driftwood arranging itself—which solves the navigational problem for her, and the meta-commentary in the dialogue momentarily disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative logic is tight, adhering to a consistent fabulist causality where the reversal of the press creates a decisive, resonant change. The closure is excellent: a physical action (turning the flywheel backward) yields a profound metaphysical result that resolves the plot while exacting a price. The drive lens holds perfectly from the inciting "vanishing stars" to the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative moves linearly from A to B, relying heavily on the stranger to explain the plot and theme in dialogue. The closure (becoming the message) is a Conceptual Repricing, but it arrives via external instruction rather than protagonist agency, reducing the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight and causal, governed by the established magical logic where lies generate heat and truth cracks the illusion. Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of leaving the prism ("Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush") lands with tangible cost and conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is secured through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the spinner into a silent messenger. The inciting incident—stumbling upon a buried box in a familiar grove—relies on coincidence, which slightly weakens the causal chain under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic with no causal friction, setbacks, or doubts testing the plan. The resolution relies on unearned poetic fiat—the arches descend simply because the silk touches them—rather than a grounded mechanism, making the closure feel inevitable and weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "loom" sequence effectively externalizes the protagonist's search, but the climax relies on a summary download of information. The transition where she "swallows the cube" and immediately wakes up with the complete conspiracy theory fully formed ("air now carries a new variable... that her lover’s ship never left") bypasses the dramatic moment of discovery, substituting exposition for scene work at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure builds tension effectively through the disruption of the established ritual. Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the lamp fails, but the human connection survives, physically manifested in the warmed glass. The pacing is controlled, though the "click" overhead relies slightly on convenient timing to resolve the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative operates on a consistent dream-logic where symbolic actions have concrete consequences, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens well. The shift from lighthouse to ship is abrupt but fits the unmooring theme, and the closure—Lirael's dissolution to birth the dawn—lands with clear, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path to a clear Conceptual Repricing (changing her goal from collecting to teaching), which provides structural closure. However, the causality relies heavily on "magical object convenience"—the wing and heart simply solve the intellectual problem when aligned. The sequence lacks causal friction; the solution is observed rather than forged.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is excellent, establishing the magical logic early (moonlight healing) and paying it off cleanly in the resolution. The "pin drop" serves as a precise, well-timed pivot that shifts the story from preparation to the climactic deconstruction, delivering a strong Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens where the protagonist's actions directly drive the reversal from dying realm to restored world. Closure is definitive and resonant (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration), earned through the sacrifice of the tool and the protagonist's physical integrity. The logic of the mirror world is consistent and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream logic where the paradox of "staying while leaving" resolves the crisis. However, the resolution relies on a high-concept magical mechanism (pouring presence into paper) that feels slightly convenient, resolving the physical threat with a metaphysical escape.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear fable-like structure with a solid logical progression from discovery to cultivation to realization. However, the middle section relies heavily on summary ("Weeks lengthened"), which diffuses narrative tension. The closure lands a resonant conceptual reconfiguration, but the ease of the resolution—magic simply working—lowers the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is executed with precision, escalating pressure through the decay of each virtue until the physical breaking point (the slide shattering). Closure lands via a strong Conceptual Repricing where data is preserved but stripped of context ("sweet and meaningless"), though the transition to the tree feels slightly compressed compared to the scene above.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, utilizing the rising tide as a ticking clock to force the climax. Closure is decisive and costly, with the trade physically enacted and the emotional price paid on the page; the waiting period validates the Causal lens where the father’s absence precipitates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "meet and greet" structure with no meaningful orientation debt but also no causal tension or reversal. The closure acts as a "gift" ending where the protagonist gains powers without paying a visible or felt cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the causality relies on magical convenience. The lock opening itself functions as a Deus Ex Machina, removing the mechanical obstacle without protagonist effort. The ending dissolves into a summary montage ("At the surface she sold no portraits...") that tells the resolution rather than dramatizing the final cost of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The climax hinges on a high-magnitude coincidence—Corin appearing at the exact moment with the exact missing map fragment—which undercuts earned causality. Additionally, the resolution relies on a sudden reversal of world rules (the vines actually liking truth) that dissolves the central obstacle without a requisite struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—leaving the sculpture and passing the wedge—effectively functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the progression is strictly linear without significant causal complications, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central concept of a "controlled burn" leading to "miniaturization" is creative but operates on dream logic that strains causality near the climax (flames writing names, box merging with chassis). While the closure is legible, the mechanics shift from sci-fi to fable without fully earning the transition, leaving the "how" of the ending somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the shift from mechanical intervention (borescope) to communal witnessing constitutes a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The fable logic holds the closure, though the transition is swift.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure resonates conceptually, but the plot relies on convenient mechanics—dice that magically act as a compass and a cooperative environment—which softens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, with excellent orientation in the opening lines. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren accepts the diffusion of memory as ballast rather than possession—lands effectively with conceptual cost (she cannot keep the specific memories). The logic of the magic system (gravity/salt) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean, linear arc with a distinct climax that resolves the immediate threat while leaving a lasting cost. The transition from abstract mapping to the visceral act of swallowing the prophecy provides strong on-page closure under a Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure creates a seamless Resonant Reconfiguration, where the opening ritual with the tutor mirrors the closing ritual with Mrs. Chen. The inciting incident (interrogating the gargoyle) causally drives the revelation and the transfer of the seal, ensuring the closure lands with earned conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is strong, with a clear causal chain from the shell's instructions to the ritual's completion. The closure is excellent, featuring a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist pays a visceral, permanent price (grayscale vision) to alter the world state. The magical logic holds consistent within the scene's established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.0)
    The scene lacks a concrete inciting incident in the present; the decision to act "tonight" feels arbitrary rather than causally triggered by immediate pressure. The plot consists of reflection leading to a symbolic gesture, missing a true turning point where options are narrowed by external resistance or internal limitation. Closure is thematic rather than narrative, resulting in a soft ending that resets the character's state without a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, with the echo mechanic perfectly mirroring the structural need for closure. The ending creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to her past is fundamentally altered, satisfying the closure gate completely.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear dream-logic progression, but the central causal mechanism—how analyzing cameos physically cracks a glacier—is asserted via rule ("Marrow understood the rules") rather than dramatized. The closure is a "task completed" success with minimal complication or unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation (search, find, release) with a resolution dependent on magical coincidence—walking a blind spiral that perfectly matches the object's inscription—rather than causal agency. The closure validates the premise but lacks a felt cost, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than tension.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving from the physical search to a puzzle resolution that blends logic with the setting’s surreal rules. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the weaponization of the diamond changes the orchard’s function, delivering a lasting conceptual consequence (truth accelerating rot).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from static isolation to a decisive transformative action. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara dissolves to become the signal; the cost is high and clearly paid on the page. The causality operates on a dream-logic compatible with the genre, though the mechanism of the "portico" manifesting is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic structure holds the lens well, though the mechanics of capturing the child's voice before the child arrives blur the timeline slightly. Closure lands via the music box's holographic projection, which feels like a convenient Deus Ex Machina that resolves the tension without requiring a harder choice or sacrifice from Posy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal arc, but the resolution relies on a "third path" that neatly sidesteps the central dilemma (shatter marina vs. release nightmares). The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist succeeds completely with minimal cost (a worn key), reducing the narrative weight of the earlier threat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent "situational" arc where physical patterns dictate social upheaval; closure is strong, delivering a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose and the world's state.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is solid, and the closure—a decision to expose the truth—is legible. However, the discovery of the journal relies on a standard "look behind the pipe" trope rather than a unique investigative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dual threads of the mechanical heart and the legal evidence converge thematically but clash logically. Using the tinkerer as a courier for vital legal evidence feels like a contrivance to bundle the resolution into a single scene. While the closure (the music box playing, the evidence sent) is emotionally resonant, the causal chain relies on convenient timing and irrational delegation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line where the missing clapper provides a tangible obstacle that forces a satisfying Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The logic of transliterating light into sound is surreal but consistent with the established world rules, resulting in a cohesive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causality is generally strong, leading to a decisive closure where the protagonist accepts the cost of erasure. However, the "lie to security" beat is a convenience that bypasses tension, and the ending sequence creates a mild spatial confusion between "orbiting the planet" and riding the "train home."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.7)
    The resolution hinges on a Deus Ex Machina—a "revocation phrase" introduced only at the moment of use without prior setup. Combined with the convenient empathy crate, the causal chain weakens significantly at the climax, leading to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where all problems are neatly fixed.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.3)
    The climax hinges on a credibility-straining coincidence (the boy hearing his mother's hum in a metal tap against a rail), which resolves the conflict via luck rather than agency. Additionally, the extended &quot;Years later&quot; summary epilogue diffuses the narrative tension and explains away the closure instead of letting the scene land.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is solid; the decision to regraft and write the note serves as a clear Conceptual Repricing of the "destiny" rule-set. The causal chain from the letter to the memory to the decision holds the drive lens effectively, though the turnaround is somewhat swift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The structure is a linear procedural (arrival, ritual, success) lacking a decisive turn or visible cost at closure. The narrative tracks a task completion rather than a causal reconfiguration of stakes or character.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure unit (the arrival of the children/ghosts) lands on the page, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the sequence relies on dream-logic without causal friction, and the "cost" of the ritual is abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a passive accumulative structure where the protagonist receives information rather than pursuing it through high-stakes choices. The climax (a book falling open to the exact answer) is a coincidence that resolves the central question without protagonist agency. Closure is a conceptual shift ("voices" replacing books), but it lacks a felt cost or a decisive change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cyclic structure works well, using the "markers" to create a legible loop of cause and effect that justifies the ending. However, the discovery of the specific "Birthday Party 1987" tape relies on coincidence or dream logic that slightly strains the causal chain within the scene's established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a coherent Situational/Accumulative lens where the observatory's collapse creates a Conceptual Repricing closure (the station becomes the photograph). The logic of the surreal transition is handled with confidence, creating a satisfying, if dream-like, causality.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is precise and efficient, moving from the setup of the "dishwater" blood work to the "Conceptual Repricing" of the final image. The closure—redefining "reunify" not as repair but as carrying the pieces—lands with earned weight and clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clean causal spine where the ritualistic actions directly force the resolution. The closure is decisive and reconfigures the protagonist's status, though the linear progression meets little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from internal crisis to a clear Conceptual Repricing via the map ritual. The resolution relies heavily on the changeling providing the solution (the map) rather than Elara deriving it solely from action, but the closure cost—abandoning objective truth for a "healing lie"—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path (Goal → Ritual → Success) with clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression relies on convenient magical responsiveness ("serpentine wall... smoothed into a mirror") rather than earned agency overcoming resistance. The transition "Memories resurfaced" is used repetitively as a scaffold, making the structure feel formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a severe coincidence: Elias finding Mira in an abandoned city data center by "following the rumor" and a "dripping cadence" is a causality break that dissolves tension. The arrival of the tablet exactly when needed functions as a deus ex machina, resolving the mechanical obstacle of the scene without cost or ingenuity from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from accumulation to a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) closure. The transition from the surreal nexus back to the desk is handled with causal precision, and the cost of facing her own unfinished work is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a strict linear progression (Wait → Sing → Bloom → Cure) without deviation or complication. The drive lens is Causal, but the causality is mechanical; there is no "Decisive Change" born of struggle, only the execution of a recipe. The closure is a "success" ending that feels inevitable rather than earned through an on-page pivot or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean, fable-like arc that utilizes the Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the alchemist accepts a new role with a legible cost (never leaving), satisfying the story's internal rules.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens with a complete Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the village fixed, the wonder archived). While the "cost" is somewhat abstract (echoes left behind), the logic holds well within the fable framework.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean with a defined inciting incident, rising action (the grotto's resistance), and a Decisive Change at the climax. Closure is strong, with the release of the burden transforming the environment and the protagonist's state. The transition from ritual to crisis flows logically under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well, using the carving process to layer memory and meaning toward a resonant closure. The final action of hanging the latch effectively reconfigures the "cage" metaphor, though the transition into the flashback feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality and internal logic are impeccable within the surreal frame; the camera mechanics and lagoon physics are established early and pay off at the climax. Closure is achieved through a decisive act (breaking the wheel) that carries a visible, irreversible cost—the loss of the undeveloped potential ("what we might have chosen").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful tasks without setbacks or causal turns that raise stakes. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where everything works perfectly with no visible or felt cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, cohesive structure: ascent, offering, realization, and descent. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to the central concept is permanently altered with the tangible cost of the abandoned prototype. Orientation is immediate and the pacing fits the contemplative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative structure is sound, but the central discovery mechanism relies on shaky logic: using a moon-cast shadow on a solar instrument to highlight a specific coordinate feels like movie physics rather than a grounded causal link. The closure, however, is decisive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central puzzle—the missing syllable of the stanza—is resolved by the coincidence of the rope striking the harbormaster's button, violating the rule that luck should complicate, not resolve. The ending leans on convenient magical realism (instant growth) and an easy escape ("ghosting into the white"), which lowers the felt cost of the confrontation. The inciting incident and rising action are strong, but the climax relies on external chance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot follows a clear Accumulative structure, successfully building through the unraveling of the thread to a legible closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration). While the "sultan's throne" backstory is a bit of a detached prop, the cause-and-effect within the magical logic holds up well to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong within the story's dream logic, leading directly from the assembly to the hatching and collapse. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the cost—the destruction of the palace—dramatized clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vignette structure is sound, and the ending offers a valid Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara decides to shift her ritual from preservation to growth. The drive lens (Accumulative) holds, though the lack of present-tense obstacles limits the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure relies on a mechanical "beads on a string" progression (Fountain 1, Fountain 2, Fountain 3) that feels like an outline rather than a causal chain. While the ending provides closure with the geese resuming flight, the journey lacks a meaningful turning point or complication; the protagonist simply follows instructions until the task is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear resolution that breaks the cycle of the garden. The gear "suddenly resolving" into a rhythm serves as a slightly convenient shortcut to closure, though the thematic payoff of leaving the heirloom creates a valid, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    A significant causal break occurs with the "carved in sleep" revelation; roots wrapped around stones imply years of growth, contradicting the timeline of a recent mining accident ("griefs too fresh"). The solution to the mystery relies on this unestablished retroactive patch, weakening the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative pivots cleanly on the completion of the carved word, utilizing the "pause in the swing" as a tangible window for agency. The closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of the clock shifts from verdict to vow, landing with the visible cost of slowed village time.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and closes with a clear change in status, but the progression relies on convenient backstory (the grandmother's sewing songs) to solve the central puzzle without on-page struggle. The linearity of finding the coin, solving the code immediately, and digging up the cellar lacks causal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from observation to action to a high-cost resolution that successfully closes the loop. The inciting incident (three seasons of tracking) transitions smoothly into the climax. The logic of the magic system holds, though the intrusion of technical terms slightly disrupts the causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is well-structured, moving efficiently from the inciting broadcast to the solstice climax. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the world's rules are rewritten by the broadcast. However, the resolution—inspectors instantly neutralized by the music—leans heavily on magical realism, softening the tactical causality and physical threat established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative logic, building a coherent ritual that culminates in a legible moment of Earned Stasis as the chair stops. While the structure is solid, the narrative arc is static; the "turn" is simply the completion of a task rather than a shift in tactics or knowledge, making the closure feel somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure relies heavily on summary and montage ("spent the after-plague months," "On the fourteenth night") rather than a continuous scene, distancing the reader from immediate pressure. While the causal logic holds, the span of time dilutes the tension of the specific "tonight" inciting moment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic logic that holds the fable lens perfectly from inciting incident to closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist pays a personal price (her voice) to alter the world state, creating a satisfying and legible sense of finality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path where magic functions perfectly on the first attempt, resolving the central conflict with a "magic bullet" ending. The closure—total victory over the Ministry with officers instantly disarmed—lacks a felt cost or complication, reading as a soft reset rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is precise, utilizing a clear causal chain (riddle → climb → obstacle → sacrifice → resolution) that leads to a resonant reconfiguration of the world state. The closure is distinct: the toll booth routine is permanently altered, and the "dead" hive is reanimated through a conceptual repricing of truth and lies.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent mythic logic with clear causality within its magical realism frame. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "anonymous package" inciting incident is a convenient deus ex machina that lowers the structural score.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal arc: awakening, understanding the object, moving to the target, and executing the release. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change that permanently alters the story world (the release of memory), grounded in the specific mechanics of the keystone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The pivot from counting primes upward to counting negative integers downward provides a brilliant structural fulcrum that physically manifests the internal change. The closure—sacrificing the dice to rupture the prison—is a Decisive Change that earns its cost and reconfigures the reality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building atmosphere effectively, but the resolution relies on magical intervention rather than a causal pivot. The coda, where the city is healed and Mira sleeps, feels like a soft reset that lacks a structural cost or earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.6)
    The structure violates the short-form scope by relying on extensive summary and time jumps ("That night," "She spent the day," "When the thaw came") to advance the plot. This "synopsis mode" prevents the formation of scene-level pressure and dissipates the tension of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is strong, with the inciting problem (death prophecy) solved through a distinct mechanism (yoyo/stone) that incurs a lasting cost (loss of counter-clockwise skill). The resolution qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration, as the character’s life is fundamentally repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the resolution relies heavily on "dream logic" convenience—specifically the dictionary providing the exact instructions to resolve the plot ("reverse the order"). This reduces the protagonist’s problem-solving agency in the climax to following a magical instruction manual.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is efficient, establishing the "physics" of sound-propulsion early so the fantastical resolution feels earned. The "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure lands effectively, translating the conceptual victory (tuning the obstacle) into physical motion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is exceptional; the Conceptual Repricing of the map—from a tool of safety to a guide into the abyss—is profound, legible, and earned. The causal chain is tight, moving efficiently from the tremor to the revelation without wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear objective and a decisive change in status (retrieval of proof) at closure. The "final petal" functioning as a precise cipher-clock is slightly convenient, but the ending creates a strong conceptual repricing of the "noble lie."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ritualistic descent functions well as a plot structure, utilizing the tide as a natural ticking clock. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical weight of the inkwell translates into a felt emotional release, though the linear progression lacks a sharp, unexpected turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the blackout as a functional inciting incident that enables the method of discovery. The climax—using the plankton to reveal the map—is visually resonant and utilizes the established setting, leading to a decisive closure (creating the new ledger) that carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a clear, dream-logic causality that lands a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost is tangible (the destruction of the moonstone/dream) and the "after" state (hands smelling of tea, not kerosene/shadow) offers a distinct, earned release. The paradoxical geometry is handled with consistent rules that serve the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the story's internal causality. However, a significant logical gap exists in the setup: accessing a drifting observatory three miles above the desert via "maintenance shafts" from a ground-level refugee camp strains credibility and confuses the spatial reality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative lacks a drive lens with tension; the protagonist arrives and immediately receives the prize without obstacle or cost. The resolution is an example of "symmetric satisfaction," where all threads tie up mechanically without a price paid on the page. The linear progression ("she arrived, he printed, she understood") lacks causal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot hinges on a timeline impossibility: the grandfather teaching Elias and carving his aged face despite abandoning the family decades before Elias’s adulthood. Additionally, finding a specific driftwood portrait of his own face at the exact moment of crisis relies on excessive coincidence or unexplained magic, breaking the story's realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of the drawer pull. However, the climax relies on soft causality: the guards lowering spears due to a hummed lullaby diffuses tension via sentiment rather than a hard narrative trade-off. The ritual resolves the conflict a bit too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The accumulative structure is legible, moving from the launch to the open sea, but the causal chain is soft; external events (wake, dolphins) serve as mood-adjusters rather than genuine tests. The "recalibration" at the end is an intellectual reframe rather than a consequence of the action, relying on a deus ex machina dolphin arrival to shift the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative loop involving the time traveler's baseball provides a brilliant Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, recontextualizing the object and the protagonist's journey. The causal chain is tight, moving logically from the newspaper discovery to the lake, with the ending landing a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain driven by the ritual, leading to a decisive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the narrator accepts the cost of merging. The logic of the magic system is consistent, and the ending reconfigures the stakes into a permanent, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    The ending constitutes a "soft reset" violation: the saucer magically heals and the lost time returns without any visible price paid by the character. The closure relies on a summary explanation of the lesson learned rather than a structural reconfiguration of the character's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic arc with low resistance; obstacles like the "mothers' warnings" are bypassed instantly without forcing a change in tactics. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "cost" (staying in the dimension) feels abstract since it aligns perfectly with her desire, lacking a sense of sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot advances through magical convenience—the mountain "rearranged its molten choreography"—rather than causal agency. The closure (lava becoming stairs) removes the threat without requiring a sacrifice or decision from Kael, undercutting the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "sundial by moonlight" mechanism is clever. The climax, however, relies on dubious "magical engineering" logic—shutting a breaker somehow reroutes a "heartbeat" to a different room—which resolves the conflict too conveniently. Closure is distinct, with Garnet unmasking, but the path there feels slightly contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central premise suffers from a critical causality break: the absence of friction is described as keeping Elias "perfectly still" on wet rocks where he should have slid, contradicting the basic physics of the concept (and the later description of eels slipping away). Additionally, the ritualistic plot lacks deviation or surprise; the outcome is foreseen and executed without obstruction, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the physical preparation to the metaphysical "broadcast" via a clear pivotal accident with the lightning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the stopped timer and the empty dish create a lasting image of "charged poise" that satisfies the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where rivalry shifts to partnership. However, the causality is driven by the puzzle's mechanics (the sundial alignment) rather than character agency; the solution is handed to the protagonist by the antagonist, weakening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid up to the climax, with the molting cycle providing a strong structural rhythm. However, the resolution of the conflict with Sergeant Rourke feels unearned; the guard accepts the "educational credit" lie too easily, deflating the tension. Additionally, the final paragraph creates an "explain-everything" ending that forecasts the future success of the library, undercutting the resonant ambiguity of the card-signing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving from a grounded opening to a surreal escalation and back to a transformed reality. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "Onward" destination recontextualizes the entire wait with palpable cost and finality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal lens, moving from inspection to diagnosis to intervention with clear consequences. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the land is saved but the savior is diminished—lands with undeniable weight and structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is legible and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration via the bonsai's color change) lands effectively. However, the plot is strictly linear—instruction followed by success—lacking causal friction or the risk of failure that drives stronger narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of dust and data tightens the equation of scale = pulsar. Closure is a Charged Poise—overlay achieved, no applause, just rain softening to mist; the cost is the stripped need to outrun storms. Orientation is anchored by word 60. No causal break; every beat is because/therefore of molecular accretion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the frost-pattern motif and holds: each shard/image layers until the final “blank gather of molten light” reweights the premise. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise—she steps off the bus into unmapped possibility—whose cost is the erased ledger and the obsidian fare already paid. No causal breaks; geography and object states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined as thermal music, paying off the “unfinished” premise with the scanner’s dead battery as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike thickens the heat-map until the dome weeps, a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Causality is clean—no teleporting props, every tool introduced is used or exhausted. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 3 and never break.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker’s self-burial in the drowned library is irreversible and legible (“written in his careful mortuary hand”). Causal chain holds: shard → catalog → paper-boat fire → lens seal → tenure. Mosaic shards (pier, boulevard, desk) are taught by 25 % and transition cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the final hush that “burns backward into the hearts of the living.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the wool slips, the bell stays silent, yet the air vibrates—an amplified quiet that reconfigures the network’s stakes without a physical act. Causal linkage holds throughout: every crate, pebble, and whispered ledger entry tightens options under sanctions. The bell’s earlier set-up (engraved ridge, muffled clapper) pays off in the final image, embedding home as sensory prohibition. Under accumulative lens, pattern intensifies rather than resolves, satisfying the 9+ cost-test on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: every wisteria petal and breath-cloud thickens the texture of withheld affection until the condensation-door image reprices love as river-return, not storage. Causality is lyric—petals accrete meaning—but the final “rectangle of paler dusk” is unmistakable Decisive Change with felt cost: the camera (old witness) dissolves, leaving them lighter. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure beat is clean, single-note, and reweights prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sealing the fragment into the hawthorn reweights the entire maze from trap to perpetual reliquary, cost legible in her future root-veins. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rings/photographs mounts until the single tear-salt image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift. No causal break; every hedge-turn is a because/therefore of memory’s erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cellophane-arrow banner and the footprints spelling the minor seventh reweight the premise—liberation is planting, not escape—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact: piano cipher → south → vault → scatter, each because/therefore link visible. Cost is present but soft: the chain still drags, yet she walks away light; the felt price is implied rather than etched on the page, holding the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian shard reweights the premise—future aids must reveal hush, not amplify sound—with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of sensory translations (heat→cello, crack→russet, fragrance→pale-gold forgiveness) tightens once when her own complicity is etched, foreclosing the old goal. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 60 (“rusted keels…drowned valley”), waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thief restores rather than steals, reweighting her own rule-set while the station petals rewrite the cipher to “go home.” Causal lens holds throughout (because/therefore linkage: ring ⇒ recognition ⇒ refusal to cut). Orientation is taught early via the floral cipher and paid off at the end, so no Orientation Test penalty. Cost is legible but abstract (she forfeits a star-jar fee and a portrait); a hair more body-level price would push this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (drip, cardamom ghost, tape ribbons) thickens the stake until the final image reweights “safe zone” from possession to gift. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s exit leaves the dome/console as resonant object for strangers, cost legible in her footprints erased by melt. No orientation debt; anchor triad delivered by line 4. Persistent constraint: the bookmark-turned-floor stays behind, forever inaccessible to its maker.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal linkage holds: because the heirs plan to retire his bruised-body brand, therefore he hunts the shell; because the shell offers the trembling-take instruction, therefore he screens the raw reel for the guards. One meaningful tightening—projector beam through the roof holes—simultaneously narrows escape options and re-weights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfiltered reel re-prices vulnerability from liability to asset with undeniable social cost. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; lens (Causal) remains unambiguous to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the oracle steps into her own outline, becoming the first coordinate of an endless night—an earned stasis that forecloses living witness. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each silenced contour literalized in the booklet thickens the hush until darkness is a liquid weight she can enter; the cost is the fort’s dissolution and her own vanishing, felt on the final page. Orientation anchors (who-where-when) are taught by line 4 and serve the final erasure; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold loop—”suggestion becoming rumor”—dulls the penultimate beat, but closure image remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the robot chooses to keep mopping, now armed with the knowledge that repetition itself is the engine of thought. Cost is concrete—the eternal return—and is legible in the final image of the mop tracing “new pathways.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of 373 loops taught early, cadence shift delivered by the single played note that reweights all prior iterations. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors (twilight, frost-rimed gravel, 43-second countdown) are clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: doodles → eavesdrop → lens discovery → communal film → forgiveness. The scavenger-hunt reveal is a micro-turn rather than a reversal, but it meaningfully reweights stakes from theft to trust. Closure lands with visible cost—Mira shoulders the “cloak” of trust, a social price. One soft spot: the prank’s engineered innocence is confessed rather than pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each marble, each seasonal taste, each maze re-configuration layers density until the final image reweights the premise—luck is irrelevant inside vegetative time. Closure is a Charged Poise: the raised gloved hand crystallizes the new contract, with undeniable conceptual cost (she can never again claim ownership). No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. The 0.03% score arrives exactly at midpoint, tightening the pattern. Cost is felt in the apple’s compressed seasons and the glove’s impossible preservation; persistent constraint is the maze that rearranges itself, proving agency is mutual.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the dawn performance reconfigures his artistic identity with undeniable conceptual cost—he abandons standard repertoire for “the spaces between.” Causal chain holds: each page re-shapes his next move; water damage literally dissolves old text to reveal new instructions. The final image (“sat at the edge of the pit…playing… the symphony of the unsung”) crystallizes options while foreclosing return to invisible accompanist role. Persistent constraint—flood + ghost code—shapes every tactic toward this disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the evacuated stone reweights the world—aurora dims, wind forgets—with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “heavier” pulses, leaf sketches warping, smudges erasing until the blank page receives the cooling planet. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“mountain weather station”), causality intact. One minor loop: “tasting of auroral light just before it breaks” echoes later “auroral sorrow,” but the reprise is purposeful, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (the drip, the rail’s rust, the mineral stink) thickens until the brass tag’s slide supplies the decisive pattern break that reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the wheel’s sudden stillness inside the slosh reconfigures options—truth is no longer lead but bearable brass—without tidy explanation. Causality is intact because every beat of investigation (hoist, roll, tilt) is directly rewarded by the hidden tag; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Cost is palpable at the exact line: “She left the wheel spinning slowly… measuring the new equilibrium”—a quiet forfeiture of further proof that lands as irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of folding/unfolding creases tightens through each reprise until the keeper herself is folded into the swan. Orientation is immediate—“obsidian refuge along the river”—and the swan’s final crack supplies decisive change with conceptual cost: she becomes silence. No causality breaks; ellipsis between swan-guides is justified by taught pattern. Closure is Charged Poise: the mirror-water bears weight without ripple, reweighting the premise that witness must become medium.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens until the eclipse pattern breaks into visible magic. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3) and causality is elastic by design—moon–sun braid functions as cadence shift, not plot twist. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: children’s fingertips spout color, a social cost that re-weights screen-dulled reality. The only slack is the off-stage diffusion of magic—no beat shows Elara’s melody failing—so the price is felt but not tautly dramatized in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silo walls absorb the dragons, the axis relocates under her sternum, and she exits emptied yet re-centered—cost is legible in the blank tapestry and the hush she now carries. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—each diary, each soot-fleck confession layers density—until the final cadence shift reweights meaning rather than causal plot. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive inside the first 90 words and hold. No lens ambiguity; pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Chen vanishes, island inside him, microdot specs traded for reading glasses—visible conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “open secrets” tightens until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) landed by line 20. Persistent constraint—prophetic fortune—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning phrase becomes a living cage, demon and priest fused in endless doubt; the cost is the priest’s erasure and the town’s perpetual listening. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each loop subtracts sound until absence itself is the snare; the logic holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught early (“the sanctuary had been built on a fold…”) so the spatial grammar is legible. One minor drag: the phrase “before the possession completes” is repeated but never tightens the clock visibly; tension is atmospheric rather than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored horizon folds into her eyelid, a Charged Poise that makes the cost conceptual yet undeniable. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; pattern is taught early (mirrored lake = backward score) and paid off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who-when-where) arrive late (~140 words) but the delay is purposeful disorientation that later serves closure, so waiver applies. No meaningful tightening inside the 30-minute window—time feels poetic, not tactical—hence barred from 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by shattering the tablet Kael pays with every possible future self, leaving only the unspoken name—an undeniable existential cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each fragment of description (up-falling rain, neon algae, sideways rain) tightens the texture until the viaduct’s ordinary gravity feels like loss. The 3:19 A.M. Archive, the 7th/13th-minute cycle, and the procedural path-computation all pay off inside the final image of the single drop. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors arrive by line 3 and the inverted night is taught as the first pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the filament-needle’s spent smoothness and the drum’s forward pulse reweight the hush from vacancy to resonance, cost felt in the tear she can’t hear but we see. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backward lullaby density + drum-birth pattern shift = emotional repricing. Orientation is swift (cavern, frost, who, when by line 3). No lens ambiguity or teleporting props; the needle’s fracture traces cleanly into its polished finale.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: forged note → lateral move → shaft descent → uncensored readings → backward-written strips released. Each step forecloses the previous option and the closure image (“truth finds its own velocity”) carries undeniable conceptual cost. One micro-turn is sufficient; the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: every sensory vignette layers density until the final “forgiveness distilled from orchid, metal, and the last shared breath” reweights the entire archive of scent-memories with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who=lantern broker; where=extinct-plant greenhouse; when=night of olfactory collapse) are fixed by line 3 and never waver. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elian steps into a city that has no smell, carrying a private atmosphere—an earned stasis that forecloses his former trade. No causal breaks; even the ghost orchid’s reanimation is seeded by Lira’s esters.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the poet steps onto the road, flesh-bound, rope-waisted, while weightless entities trail—an image that reweights every prior mention of texture vs. transcendence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building repetitions (rope, clay, starlight) tighten until the final cadence shifts option-weight. Cost is felt in the body he keeps and the eternity he refuses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside first 120 words; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each unfinished note thickens the pattern until the final Charged Poise reweights silence as invitation. Orientation is swift (“ash-slick mud”, “half-submerged schooners”) and the disorientation of a flooded greenhouse is taught early, paid off in the closing image of music that will not close. Closure arrives with unmistakable conceptual cost: the seedling’s green question against copper light reconfigures the family rule (“no bonfire, no crowd”). Persistent constraint—the bowl’s cracked bottom—literally shapes the resonator that enables the final sound.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final palm-to-amber-ground image reweights the entire premise—she pays with reachable pain, not a new product. Causal linkage holds: because she inhales the subsuming scent, therefore her armor strips off. The “vial cracked” beat provides persistent constraint: she can no longer inventory her own stock. Cost is legible in the single line “for the first time, she let it hurt,” making the before/after undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: waived fees → mother’s photo → envelope misdelivery → night delivery → NGO reveal → locket surrender, each because/therefore link tightening her exposure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty sleeve and “miscellaneous inbound—value immeasurable” reprice her covert kindness as public freight. Cost is legible—she parts with her sole relic and forfeits anonymity—so the ledger cycle is foreclosed with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each heron tag found adds density until the mercury lattice reconfigures kinship as forged, not inherited. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crater exhales, orchard lifts to major key, Lira’s glyph glows—cost is the irrevocable shift from solitary seeker to signpost. Causality intact: every step of tag-hunting tightens the web that finally cradles her. Minor scaffold: “pathways of crushed moonstone forked...” could drop “of,” but no artifact obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each borrowed second literally repaid by digit-boats. Orientation locked by line 3; causality remains “because/therefore” via cadence → water reversal → ledger of seconds → cage melts. Closure (conceptual repricing) lands as Mobiused pendant seals and future minutes sail away—cost unmistakable, pattern intact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the astrolabe-seedlings fusion reframes grief from unsolved absence to living limit. Causal chain is lyric but legible—glass eyes → spiral → astrolabe → seedlings—each step a micro-turn that tightens the stakes; the cost is the open-ended guardianship the narrator now carries, shown in the lighter satchel and departing footstep.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the grid surges but the library holds its breath, re-weighting Elias’s invisible labor into a shared, audible future. Causality is causal-lite yet intact: because he cached → because outage → therefore voices rise → therefore girl joins → therefore he is seen; each step narrows his anonymity to zero. The Orientation Test is passed by line 6 (who=under-floor man, where=library crawl-space, when=dawn outage). No lens ambiguity; pattern is accumulative but the ending reconfigures under a single, undeniable social cost—he can never be a ghost again. Persistent constraint: once the girl knows, his solitude is permanently foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine—storm → glowing leaf → body merger → nursery change—tracks cleanly; each beat triggers the next. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nursery’s new regime of “controlled wildness” is legible, and the felt cost is the silver-veined leaves bearing her face. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the sprinkler system activation is coincidental, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vial of pre-war water and the transformed insomnia reweight the entire quest. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—spiral shells, brooch warmth, and fresco bleeds tighten pattern until the final image crystallizes options. Cost is unmistakable: Mara trades her vigilance for a dream-filled sleep, forfeiting the monk-like watch that defined her. Lens stays coherent; no orientation debt; one shard, one transition, one deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s entrance vanishes after the pilgrim accepts the irreversible transfer, crystallizing the price under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The “steady unpredictability” rule is taught early via echoing chimes and re-paid in the final cadence that seals the cave. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the single trumpet tone folds silence into city doorways—an undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-logical: fragment → whole → public resonance; each shard advances knowledge of what absence sounds like. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive before 120 words; staggered-interval motif is pattern-taught early and paid off in final cadence. No teleporting props or luck; the missing mouthpiece is foreshadowed and traded for future echo, satisfying because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain intact: punch → arrows → tunnel → fortress → canvas. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sunrise-paint reweights every prior ticket. Cost is visible—“wet sigil on his chest.” Orientation clear by word 60; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star alignment thickens pattern until porous walls admit whale song; the tile’s lift at midnight is the decisive reconfiguration. Closure—Mara places the tile in tidepool, relinquishing ownership—pays visible conceptual cost: her mother’s empty notebook now houses communal score, academia foreclosed. Causality is lyric, not plot-logic, but pattern is taught early (“numbers crawled when viewed sideways”) and fulfilled when ink becomes staves. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (tower deck, chart table, tide line) remain crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of crystalline corridors, color-thunder, magnetic moans tighten the stake of “goodbye” until the wooden door reweights infinity itself. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vey’s step through darkness crystallizes unruled time, felt cost in the silence that “rang like thunder” across his heart. No causal gaps; each fold and fragment accrues toward that last heartbeat-click. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by prismatic folds and solar storm within first 120 words; pattern pays off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: because Julian died → Cassidy waits; because ink demands payment → she sacrifices memory; because Rurik writes → granite melts. The single-scene orientation is locked by line 3, the 2:13 a.m. timestamp tightens the clock, and the closure image—blood-addressed envelope—delivers conceptual cost under Charged Poise. No teleporting props, no policy hand-waving; every rule is paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory texture she records refracts back into living seed, tightening the pattern until the final ash-snow reweights meaning. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the lamp dims to “ember,” the bonsai grow full-sized, and the town’s silence is now “seeded” with futures she must keep inventing—cost felt without exposition. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“the town went silent”) and anchors hold; no causal breaks. One hairline slip: “the labyrinth was reading her inventories” drifts toward personification convenience, but the image immediately pays off in sap and wire, so the lens stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the poison label repurposed into a commemorative plaque reweights the port’s memory rule-set with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each glued scrap thickens the counter-archive until the final image crystallizes new skin of memory. Causality is clean—Mara’s layering of voices directly garbles drone sensors, earning her safe dispersal. One hairline slip: the captain’s micro-recorder arrives late yet is accepted because it pays off immediately in the tagging campaign.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the ephemeral compass now pulses with his own heartbeat, reconfiguring the riddle from “why are the sounds the same?” to “why demand difference?”—a conceptual repricing paid for by the cracked shell and completed cello. Causal linkage holds: each resonant note literally rebuilds the instrument and re-stories his past, so the final silence is inevitable. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned observatory on the cliff”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of retold voices → denser cello → galaxy above sound-hole; escalation is the tightening of audible memory until silence becomes the fourth note.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Lina’s release of the stone reconfigures “becoming” as an endless drift rather than a possessable landmark, and the cost—perpetual unreadability to outsiders—is legible in the final image of the city sailing “unreadable.” Causality holds: each graffiti tag, barge swap, and riddle child is a because/therefore riposte to the inspectors’ arrival. Orientation is anchored by line 3’s drowned coast and calliope dawn; no disorientation persists. One minor scaffold: “bright, rickety, and unreadable” triad could compress, but it does not dull the final toll.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the split grain timers, Earthrise glow, and anemone folds build density until the shutter clicks compress the stakes into one frame of extinction. Closure is a Charged Poise—camera frozen on ghost flower fossil, crimson grain confirming no margin left—cost is the irreversible loss of both species and her own future memory. Causality intact: pink bloom signals exact shutter release, no coincidence. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“moonlit summit of Mount Selene”) and pattern taught early; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: cracked wing → battery swell → spectrum diagnosis → water retraining → launch. Closure is a Decisive Change: drone departs, village antidotes now possible, Lira’s method validated. Anchor lifts at seven-minute countdown supplies a hard external clock; orientation is clear by word 60. One minor causality fuzz: how the rain-barrel light pattern actually rewrites the drone’s feedback loop is asserted rather than shown, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: beats accrete sensory pattern (spiral condensation, atlas blank page, river words in light) until meaning reweights at the liminal shaft. Causality is present but subordinated to charged repetition; each image returns with greater charge, culminating in the conceptual repricing of the glowing thread-map under the ice. Closure lands on-page: Maren’s illuminated page dissolves into living water, transferring its ink to the world—an undeniable visible cost. The pattern is taught early (spiral droplets) and paid off at the very last line, satisfying the Accumulative test.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: Elian becomes the tenth bell, re-tuning the town forever; the image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—he is the perpetual keeper, no longer human. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of footstep-drink-return culminates in the sand-to-flower transmutation; because/therefore linkage is lyric, not causal, and holds. Orientation is taught early (“beneath the ancient archway of Viremont”) and pays off at the keystone-strike, so no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs at the seventh circuit when the fork begins to sing—pressure crystallizes, options narrow to self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the temple keeps singing while Mira is hauled toward a sky she may not reach. The lilac-tinged aria reconfigures solitude into signal, undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: scented drop → luminous plankton → cathedral resonance. One soft spot: orientation is fractionally late; “cracked lapis tiles” and “flooded nave” arrive after the first 120 words, though the disorientation ultimately pays off in the hush motif.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lattice reframes the father’s lies into a true beam, Cassian walks out carrying the hush as pulse—cost is the forfeiture of innocence and the acceptance of paternal curse. Causal lattice (“because the boy bit wood”) → accumulative echo (“every corridor bore his father’s name”) → final downward stair rewrites lineage. Orientation anchored by copperlight/hinges/lens by line 4; no penalty. The hovering floor forgets gravity twice, each time paid off in stance shift; no retroactive rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: bead heartbeat → nightly visitations → fruit currency → debt extraction. Orientation anchored by line 3 inside greenhouse; no drift. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: boy keeps seed, seasons return, debt cycle broken. Persistent constraint—aluminum coat that burns her—shapes late tactics and images.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Calyx’s kneel and whisper crystallize cost without restoring the lost sea. The illustration plate’s dissolution and the first orchid wave land the before/after change on the page. One soft spot: the canyon’s sudden gift of new passages reads a shade convenient, but the loom’s autonomous spin immediately re-anchors the magic within the established dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prayer house re-assembles itself at sunrise, shadow by shadow, reconfiguring belief without declaring victory. Causal linkage holds: each noon alignment of the dial shortens the shadow, foreshadowing the bell that rings tongue-less. The opening orients by 50 words; mosaic shards (tomb, orchard, ruins) braid cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint—the sundial cemented into chapel floor—guarantees she is now planet-anchored, exile foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unsigned letter’s surrender reweights anonymity from shield to prison. Causal lens holds: because she mails the unsigned note, the confession stays in pocket, erasing the chalk map. Cost is on-page—“the ebony clipboard felt lighter now”—a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props; pattern of chalk codes taught early and paid off in the gray swirl wipe.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the new-star embroidery reweights the entire night’s stakes, making survival feel unfinished rather than won. Causal lens holds throughout—every because/therefore linkage (scholars’ contempt → overheard intel → hidden layer ignition) tightens options until the pistol lowers. Cost is legible in the final image: she re-lights the candle, accepting eternal vigilance. No orientation debt; mirrors, thread, dome anchors are clear by line 40.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spoken apology seeds the future and reweights the window message. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (shard, moths, condensation) accretes until the final drop reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught lyrically by line 4 and repaid at exit, satisfying the waiver. One tightening at the ceiba fork suffices. Cost is visible in the healed cut and empty pockets; no lens contradiction. Sits just outside 9.0 because the brother’s future stance remains prospective rather than confirmed on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet, ink smudge, and coral whorl layers density until the final palimpsest reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—coral aligned with plaster, “handle with tides” inscription—visible cost on the page. Early orientation (anesthetic, atrium, twilight) anchors within 50 words, pattern taught by mist-click droplets as syllables. No causal gaps; every beat is because/therefore of sense memory pressing toward confession.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glaze-layer thickens the fog-screen until the living wall grafts memory onto masonry; the decisive reconfiguration lands when the fragment dissolves into the laughing mural—conceptual cost: joy is now public, vulnerable to weather and witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound folds and color inversions tighten stakes through cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; pattern of folding taught early and paid off in final “breathing book” image. Closure is a Charged Poise: “I will never be certain…” reweights premise with conceptual cost; shimmer climb makes price visible. No lens ambiguity; one transition inside dream-fold is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: each seed-planting act is a therefore-link that tightens drone heat. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"Resist" vine rewrites reality rules, cost legible in satellite-proof illegibility. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when inside greenhouse). No causal amnesia; pollen-cloud trick is set up by earlier orchid tendrils.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing petals drifting outward re-weight every prior sleepless hour into breathable oxygen, a conceptual cost that reconfigures the war-to-come. The accumulative/textural drive is taught early—droplets as planetarium—and holds: the final bioluminescent throat is the pattern’s payoff. Orientation is clear by line 5; no debt. Causality is lyric-associative rather than plot-sequential, permissible under the chosen lens. The only hairline slip is a faint echo of “shyly unstoppable” twice in the last third, mildly overstating the already-seen.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern by the third sentence—object-to-memory conversions—and each added name-bulb tightens the same equation: one memory = one resurrection. The chandelier’s demand is the single rule that escalates and forecloses; Lira’s final payment is the Decisive Change with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored in the first 30 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty tube falling through cloud decks reconfigures the reader’s sense of what music now costs.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by surrendering the ink well Elara trades personal proof for civic resonance, cost legible in “her absence the final note.” Causal chain holds—because she offers restitution, the archive reciprocates, therefore trust can propagate—lens stays causal throughout. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by word 30, no debt incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby modulates the amphitheater’s acoustics, turning discord into harmony, and Mireya pockets the now-warm chain—palpable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens; causality from adhesive pattern → coordinates → lullaby is tight, and mountain-as-mediator rule is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s dust-mote ballet layers density until the attic becomes a score, culminating in Charged Poise—the constables find only the pulsing meteorite chip rectangle. Orientation is anchored by word 40; transitions are clean mosaic shards. Closure reweights the premise: the song’s survival is now airborne, undeniable, with Mirela’s erased body the cost. Persistent constraint: pigeon loft built from rejected libretti shapes every subsequent flight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of images (terrace drift / grain rings / weather code) progressively reweights the stake of “necessary distance.” Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Juniper steps off the terrace into the maze-between-heartbeats, crystallizing options with undeniable conceptual cost: perpetual exile as the price of understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught lyrically but precisely inside 120 wds; disorientation later pays off at closure, so waiver holds. One soft spot: the butterfly-effect plane deviation is delivered in retrospective summary, slightly blurring cause-and-effect immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the paper bird ignites as final burnt feather, reweighting belonging as reciprocal not possessive. Causality holds—each chalk star correlates to an external ruin, the shared exhale is mirrored, and the city’s inhale is returned. Cost is legible in the pinion inheritance and the torn page she can never recover.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the cliff felt abandonment, therefore Lira offers it a new narrative; because she arranges the mosaic, the sand-path forms. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the living ribbon of light reweights “path” from physical route to migratory story, cost felt in the sealed cave and her empty bucket. One minor causality wobble: the bird’s second seed drop is pure gift, not earned by prior tactics, but it complicates rather than resolves. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive before 120 words; geode rules taught through color-transliteration.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Cipher walks away before the jackpot bells, releasing outcome to the stars; the cost is the forfeiture of certainty and the coin itself, making the before/after of risk legible. Causal chain (bishop → ferret → soapy cosmos → shared nostalgia) is tight, no props teleport. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with corroded grating, tidal clock, and neon puddles; transitional “Across the arcade” keeps spatial track.

    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each spiral of dance adds density until the stanza bruises her collarbones, a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost—the moonstone’s last grain gone, exile made irreversible. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure beat lands on the final period that reweights the premise: she is now the contraband memory.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the prism’s flares intensify pattern-density until the lattice reseals windows—visible Decisive Change with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 3; no penalty. The drip-ring cipher is taught immediately, so the pattern payoff at closure is legible. Persistent constraint: the healed cracks remain in the town’s glass, a lived price that shapes future storms.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the open box and spiral ink reconfigure meaning with undeniable social cost—tomorrow’s survivors’ group will read his skin. Causal chain holds: ash → taste → ink → signal, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and paid off when moonlight projects the fracture pattern onto his cheek. No lens ambiguity; accumulative density peaks at the granite altar image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the balloon’s ascent reweights the grotto patterns, and “hope = watched becoming watcher” crystallizes new meaning with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each balloon, shell, kelp strand layers density until the final image reconfigures reality—so lens holds. Orientation is anchored by 40 words; no teleporting props. Minor slip: the blood-drop equation is declared, not dramatized, so the price is felt abstractly, not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative cadence of negatives/diary fragments tightens like a ratchet; each glimpse reweights the stake until the tunnel turns Mira into the building’s memory. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corridor now breathes her scream, a cost felt in the rebuilt common room. No causality breaks; the ivy-shutter-developer metaphor is taught early and paid at the end. One of the few 600-word pieces where the final image re-codes every prior sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gifting the heartbeat reweights the city’s mirrors from scar-showers to possibility-windows with undeniable social cost—she forfeits her currency. Lyrical mosaic (four short shards) taught its pattern by 25% and holds an Accumulative/Textural lens throughout; final bell-pigment shower crystallizes cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Cost is legible in “she set the heartbeat inside the frame,” leaving her without compass; earlier causal trades foretell this loss.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard’s shattering disperses memory into shared aurora-light, making peace a practice rather than a treaty. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each offering layers density until the altar becomes cairn—though the arrival of enemies relies on ritual “pull” rather than prior motivation. Cost is legible in Voss’s empty hands and the terrace’s erosion, meeting the 9- test, yet a slight causal fuzz at the crowd’s ascent keeps it just below the excellence tier.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: swallowing the note reweights his voice forever, undeniable social cost. Causal lattice holds: because he built the dam, therefore the salt flat, therefore the map, therefore the egg can sing only now, therefore he must ingest the echo. Orientation anchors by line 6; no lens drift. Persistent constraint—rain held back until this instant—shapes tactics and final image. Cost is legible in the last line: “absence beating in the hollow of his voice.”

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lys steps into the mirror-void, surrendering stolen memories, and the city’s dream-chains become visible—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each untangled knot literally melts snow and rewrites citizens’ dreams. One micro-drag: “between sigh and smile” time-marker is lyrical but blurs elapsed time inside the sanctuary; because the final image re-orients, orientation waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the ash-ink manifesto reweights the premise—stories must stay unresolved—and the dome graffiti carries undeniable social cost (his elite reputation forfeited). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each smoke-marionette image thickens the texture of regret until the reversal feels inevitable. The stick’s rule is taught early and paid off; no orientation debt. Minor cap: the pivot sentence is a touch declarative, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the card’s dissolution reweights preservation from static artifact to mutable air, felt cost unmistakable in “heavier by the cargo of voices.” Accumulative lens holds throughout—each sensory braid adds density until the aurora flares white, then eases into dawn melt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure when the same aurora skylight dims. No causal breaks; rope-and-card mechanics are legible and constrain the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “continuity is the art of letting go in the right order” reweights the premise and fuses human, directive, and storm into one breathing system. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of melted objects, upward rain, seed-staircase—rather than causal beats; cost is conceptual yet undeniable (body becoming conduit, bunker undressing itself). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but taught by ~80-word mark and payoff at closure, so no penalty. One transition (wake→climb) is legible; no teleporting props or knowledge leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the astronomer’s self-erasure reweights the palace itself into a silent oracle—conceptual cost legible in “dust that refused to settle.” Causal lens holds: each schematic stroke tightens access to the sanctum; the tile’s final diagonal triggers the irreversible vow. Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the chamber must stay secret—shapes the final image and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: leaving the silenced, doubly-broken box reweights the entire rule-set—peace is not mended melody but willingness to keep turning damage. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each ghost’s thaw is a density increase signaled by sensory pattern breaks (stone→silk, ceiling→sky). Orientation is taught early via the melting-glass simile; by 120 words we know who, where, and the non-causal dream logic. Persistent constraint—broken pin that can never sound again—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image, satisfying cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: each breath/blood act tightens options until the dream is re-anchored. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—blood, soldered sextant, sapling mirror-leaves—reconfiguring solitude into orchard-rooted growth. No lens ambiguity; constraint persists in the sapling.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: pressure mounts through sensory density and pattern of deciduous vows composting into new wood. Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s scent becomes an unspoken covenant—conceptual cost legible in the drift of coconut/copper over strangers. Orientation anchors by line 4 (crumbling nave, plaster saints) and spatial choreography stays clean across scaffold, rafters, rose-window gap. No causality breaks; each graft, ampoule crack, and pollen release is a tactile micro-choice that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “The curator is the catalog” reweights the entire orchard-laboratory system so that forgetting becomes the price of knowledge. Causality is lyric-accumulative: every galaxy-fruit plucked deletes an actual past kindness, a linkage taught in the “page vanished” refrain and paid in the final footnote of starlight. The bathroom-as-chrysalis is seeded early (“only place where telepathy dampened”) and returns to host the decisive inversion—mirror peels into corridor—so the lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable: erased birthdays swirl down the drain while new asteroids germinate, making the bargain visceral before the final lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara plants absences into the world, the diary page flutters, and the cello chord reconfigures the reader’s sense of history’s cost. Causal chain holds from synonym-seed → cipher → door → theft of emptiness. Orientation is quick (obsidian shelf, mountain pulse by line 1), transitions legible across glossary-stairs → root-reading-room, lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout. Only micro-slippage: “year removed from her death” is stated, not dramatized, so the cost is felt but not visible in body or aftermath within scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald card dissolves into green fire that writes a two-voiced name across the sky, costing the ship and their separateness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard-sentence and lily-syllable intensifies density until the fog becomes the book’s final page. Orientation is taught early (“salt-streaked porthole… drifting in a foggy bay”) and pays off when the bay turns into an open book. Persistent constraint: they must speak the name together or lose it—this shapes every forward move.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal chain is pristine: seal → rope → frozen clock → village re-inscription; each because/therefore linkage narrows options until the clock exhales and folds time. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the clock struck four, though her watch insisted it was only three” makes the cost of rewritten chronology legible. Orientation taught early: brass plate “should have been solid stone” signals rule-bend before 120 words. No teleporting props, no amnesia; the diplomat’s seal bleeds into rope in continuous view, persistent constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the released sigh reweights silence from survival tool into legacy medium, cost paid by the cracked stone and the unknowable future. Causal chain holds: ice reading → circle scored → beings folded → map left → words released. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“echo chamber stone”), well inside the 120-word window. One transition (Mirror Pool → Abyssal Gate) is legible; mosaic pattern is not needed. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rose lamp ignites and she becomes “the new prism,” refracting past voices into future promise; the conceptual cost—she now burns instead of the lamp—lands on the final line. Accumulative lens holds: each shard-gathering beat deepens silence until the hush shard reweights the stake from personal quest to communal beacon. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of crystal voices, fog pellets, and lightning statues keeps tightening until the released lake-dive memory snaps the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the blank-faced melting figurine reweights the whole premise: identity as mosaic, not ledger. Cost is inescapable: she forfeits archival immortality, walks away “pockets empty, mind uncluttered.” Orientation locked by word 30; every micro-measurement advances the sky-to-copper pulse toward the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: eclipse-corked sky → Luma’s arrival → trade → stealth ascent → rocket heart → sky cracked → hourglass sand floats; each beat because/therefore narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the fused glass heart orbits the governor’s wrists, sand now playful fireflies, proving order has been mock-gravity-charged. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear in first 50 words; no ambiguity at end. No props teleport; the rag knot’s note fuses inside the flame, paying off setup.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the warmed cicada and merged silhouettes make reconciliation legible without declaration, paying the cost of swallowed pride. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each tide-image thickens the dominant stake of “will they speak again?”—and the final cadence shift (“neither night nor day”) reweights time as shared silt. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors (grotto, lantern, star-shift) are fixed by line 5 and return to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The hour-long gravity inversion is announced in line 1, anchoring who-when-where immediately; orientation debt zero. Cause-and-effect linkage is lyric but legible: whispering Mira → iron-door silence; brushing root → lullaby hush; trading memory → coil of quiet; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emptied doll wedged between vines visibly reweights the premise—she carries the sky instead of the bunker. The cost is felt in the final breath she inhales, now “thin, ungilded, hers.”

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of silence vs. noise tightens through sensory beats until the spoken fear crystallizes new weather—closure is a Charged Poise with conceptual cost (sky reweights the confession). Orientation is taught lyrically; disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. Causality is loose but coherent: dissolution of crystals → speech → re-crystallization, a ritual logic rather than because/therefore chain. One tightening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single, continuous scene anchors who-where-when within the first 120 words; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of painted layers, ruby fragments, biolum fruit—escalating toward the crown’s reconstitution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne accepts her not as monarch but as living bridge, the conceptual cost (“maintaining the delicate balance”) legible in the final smile. No causal amnesia or teleporting props; mural reveal and spiral staircase are set up by the ruby’s molecular map.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each burn-scar, breath-hold, and star-ash layer thickens until the ring becomes a literal threshold that reweights living/death stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—she will “practice suffocating again”—with undeniable cost (solitude, perpetual lung-death). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks, though the boy’s suffocation-backstory is delivered in one compressed info-drop rather than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: voicemail hum → 42 Hz pipe resonance → crystallization night → bolt circuit → diamond release. Each beat is a therefore-link that narrows options until the ocean catch. Closure image—diamond tossed, tide calming—delivers conceptual repricing: debt transmuted into planetary calm, cost legible in palm blood and dark screen. Orientation is taught by line-3 copper-spore anchor; disorientation later payoff at "seam between worlds." No plot amnesia; props (bolt, pager, hose) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: missing crank → intuition-guided search → playback → public confession → dynasty delegitimized. The closure is a decisive, irreversible social rupture whose cost is the literal shedding of Arin’s name and blood. Orientation is swift; who/where/when locked by word 50. One minor elasticity: the wax recording’s contents are accepted without suspicion, but this is consistent with the tale’s mythic register, so lens stays causal to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the knight’s human shell walks away while the wooden guardian remains, a visible cost that reweights the premise—freedom is another’s puppetry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each surreal image (upside-down sap, clockwork seeds) layers density until the final exchange crystallizes meaning. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and never breaks. The cost is legible in the last heartbeat of the latch-click and the sealed greenhouse door.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“dust that coughed stories”) and holds: dust → crescent → line → dots → photo → new folder → envelope. Closure is a Charged Poise: Rowan seals the box, city snow begins its own accretion, and the button’s afterimage transfers vigil from her to the unknown next archivist—cost is the lifetime watch she recommits to. One transition (room → corridor → street) is legible; orientation is anchored by word 60. No prop teleporting; the brass button’s entry is unmotivated by intake forms but that very unmotivation is the inciting mystery, not a logic break.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the erased note reconfigures time itself, the grotto exhales, and the hush settles into moss with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first prism flare to final dew-necklace; each sonic layer tightens the stakes. No causal gaps; even the prophecy’s missing consonant is foreshadowed by the mother’s breath-shaped words.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s mirror-world accepts the monuments, leaves descend, and “mossy delight” reweights memory itself. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each tiny monument warms the dust speck until the sky answers; the final image of pollen spirals and peat-scented mulch crystallizes the new equilibrium with unmistakable cost. One micro-turn (leaves reverse direction) is cleanly prepared by rune prophecy and Mireya’s iterative offerings; no outline-like sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias abandons the compass and the frozen watch, re-weighting time as self-invented. Cost is legible in the blank clock-faces and the shop sign “Out Tinkering Indefinitely.” Accumulative lens holds: each 3:17 echo layers pattern until the final city-wide lurch. The waterfall-as-time image reprises early stasis, now revalued.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the mended coin becomes an internal scale, reweighting “what was lost” against “what remains possible” in a single, resonant image. The causal chain—cracked coin → four limit-tests → gold seam → sternum-anchor—tightens option and meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every added gram of regret or starlight narrows the next move. Cost is unmistakable: the twentieth ounce of tear-gold is paid on-page, and the foundry walls retain a “silent syllabus,” a persistent constraint left behind. The ending beam-levels the premise without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty silk cord glows, reconfiguring Echo Gorge from confession-grave to laughter-nursery with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain is clean—because the harp bends memory, therefore Elara must fracture her talisman to re-tune the giggle. The luminous ache travels wire-to-mist-to-palm, a visible price that forecloses her returning unchanged. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sonic distortions intensifies until the final chord reweights the gorge’s rule-set; no contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ultraviolet leaf-drop, proprioceptive jolt, and equation layers density until the final Charged Poise (“one decimal nearer to zero suffering”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never waver. Closure cost is unmistakable: the strap cools to trash, a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior millijoule of shame into “close enough.” No causal amnesia; each spasm of recalled torture tightens the asymptotic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens-less future is irrevocable (“absence weighs more”) and the new rooftop lighthouse beam confirms the reweighted world. Causal linkage holds—painting heartbeat date → memory trigger → fragment return → market re-appearance—each because/therefore step narrows options until the protagonist exits the loop. Orientation is taught by the swaying catwalk image at word 30, waiving any penalty; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recursive images (barrel, crack, ticket) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stepping into dawn while holding the warm stub reconfigures the loop without dismantling it, and the cost is the perpetual tension of “keep ascending, cracks and all.” Pattern is taught early (fluorescent buzz = time pulse) and the final flicker’s return pays it off. One micro-turn (ceiling crack reveals her own future) tightens stakes; no orientation debt; no prop teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the library folds into a sigil tucked behind a heartbeat, re-weighting the rule-set of negotiable reality with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because he prints the sentence, therefore the orchard destabilizes and time folds. Pattern (frost→sentence→sigil) is taught early and paid off in the final image under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: crushing the shard rewrites the asteroid’s reality and seeds a new polis, cost paid with her dissolution. Causal chain holds: shard vision → mirror-denial method → storm bypass → sacrificial remake. Orientation is taught early (“baroque asteroid’s obsidian wall”) and anchors hold; no lens ambiguity. One transition (her kneel to intruder entry) is clean and contiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orrery’s chord cracks the sky and Elias’s personal lie becomes communal light; cost is the irretrievable loss of the childhood chip and the lifelong public truth he must carry. Causal lens holds: because he confesses → rust loosens → chip roots → dawn returns. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) land by line 50. No late rule changes; the covenant’s honesty requirement is seeded early and paid off. One minor tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens immediately—petrichor as stored beginnings—and tightens through density: each vial, graffiti tag, fossil confetti adds to the quilt of silence. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the factory whistle moves inside her chest, re-weighting the whole town’s time-sense. The cost is unmistakable—she forfeits explanatory agency and becomes conduit—charged image delivered without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each salt-stitch of shadow thickens the ledger until the miniature archway crystallizes as Charged Poise. The dissolve of the glass slide into the sculpture is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she forfeits technological certainty for timewoven memory. Causality is lyric but coherent: lantern → shadow → carving → fleet kneels → she rows out unguided. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words and pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each seasonal image adds density until the moonflower opening re-weights the premise. Closure is the Conceptual Repricing—Liora mails the postcard back with “The shadow is the root of the glow,” revaluing darkness as creative source. Cost is conceptual but undeniable within the lyric contract. Pattern is taught early (postcards, glass, hush) and pays off in final indigo panes; causality is associative, not sequential, which fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lagoon’s rule-set is taught within the first 120 words and every subsequent image obeys it; the causal chain is “trade tomorrow → memory surfaces → body archives,” tightening until the final public reading makes the cost civic. Orientation is swift: who (Mireya), where (two cables above the erg), when (pre-sandstorm salvage) all land before word 100. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options crystallize—silence or broadcast—and the chosen path carries undeniable civic and bodily price. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the first black-mirror wink to the burnt-ink sunset.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is elegant: because every citizen wished for comfort, their evaporation is the irreversible consequence; because the alchemist wished for truth, he alone remains, forced to invent a civilization of one. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the flagpole ash-ink inscription “Civilization is the story we agree to remember imperfectly” re-weights the entire premise—revival without resurrection is possible only through serial forgetting. Cost is visible in the cooling bottle and the narrator’s cracked-voice street-naming at dawn. One legible transition (well-choked ledger → telegraph office) keeps mosaic shards coherent under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: splitting the bead reconfigures time and seeds her pulse with spiral cost. Causal logic holds—sap slows vortex, seeds descend, cap fractures—under an Accumulative/Textural lens where image density, not plot reversals, reweights stakes. The ledger warning and egg hatch are well-placed foreshadow, anchoring the entropy mechanic early.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: six bell waves replace the mandated siren, reconfiguring city-wide meaning and Mara's future options. Causal chain holds—pressure dip → rope tug → toggle splice → bell resonance—with persistent constraint (toggle left in place) shaping next solstice. Cost is legible in the instant of unauthorized tolling and dawn descent “heart drumming.” No orientation or lens ambiguity; mosaic pattern not needed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s mirrors become a welcoming committee, reweighting the premise that humanity must only observe. Cost is undeniable—he walks down without the lantern, chest now the “softer lamp,” a felt forfeiture. Accumulative lens holds: each meteor reflection thickens pattern until the final image breaks it open into invitation. The yellow heart-shaped afterimage is on-page proof that the universe paid back his vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fracture seals because Alden verbally accepts the covenant’s sweetness-to-bitter risk, reweighting the rule-set. Causal lens holds—every beat obeys because/therefore logic (ghost offers jar → parchment absorbs → fracture propagates → he speaks). Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“sun-cracked frames… dunes”) and taught pattern of mute ghosts is legible throughout. Persistent constraint (fragile pane) shapes tactics and final image; cost is unmistakable in the shared hush that scents clover across ash.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shift from measuring time to exchanging sensations is crystallized when the fragment is traded for a snow-globe minute, reweighting the world’s currency. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each description-tag adds density until the final barter reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Cost is legible—“genuine shiver” and the felt footstep-Braille—though the beat is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral dissolves yet the chord hums on, reconfiguring the poet’s options with undeniable conceptual cost—“incomplete is the only doorway.” Accumulative lens holds: each fragment (feather, zither buzz, kite tail) layers density until the pattern break (walking the spiral outward) releases the sustained note. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“ankle-deep in the cobalt lagoon”). No causality breaks; the snapped kite string returns as braided sunrise, paying off the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each copper wrap thickens the living circuit until the orchard inhales as one organism. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s torn-out diary page ink-bleeding into copper—visible cost that reconfigures the treaty from private record to shared current. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and hold. The fox’s earlier yawn-as-consent is lightly convenient, but subsequent roosting bats and kits chasing sparks earn the communal frequency on-page. No meaningful escalation lapse; the slow tempo is the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fly’s 40-million-year wings beat once, then dissolve into golden spores that rewire Mara’s map of home at a molecular level—cost is visible, felt, and irreversible. Causal lattice holds: each sculpture failure → tower resonance → spore release is a because/therefore chain triggered by her deliberate amber placement. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no disorientation persists. The tower’s gentle collapse is not coincidence but the logical exhale of an experiment concluded, erasing the return-path she refuses to take.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the battlefield dissolves into a glowing grove and the coachman whispers “begin,” re-pricing his entire vocation under a new covenant. Causality holds: because he speaks the trilobite syllables, the seeds strike metal and bloom; because the gull answers, he locates the exact acre. Orientation is swift—twilight, blooming jetty, coral dust—taught by line 3. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each added layer of dead tongue, seed, and floral note tightens the chord until the final cadence widens the “narrow vastness” into a road. Cost is legible in the split pod, bleeding tongue, and the horses now smelling of salt and petals—constraint that forecloses weapon-cargo forever.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the leaf’s softening wax reweights “distance into closeness” with orchard-scented cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ozone pop, lithium 500, iron 300) densifies until the needle skip crystallizes coordinates. Orientation is taught by the hound’s nose within 120 words; disorientation never materializes. The final image of threshold-leaf and wind-shift from gunpowder to smoke is an earned sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens: silence-sky-compass pattern layers until the hatch-maps detonate into corridor light, re-weighting grief as shared cartography. Closure is a Charged Poise: mother and son eternally sketching, cost paid by eternal exile from normal time. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but the emotional logic is unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain: climb → chess duel → secret bishop swap → gravity inversion → lord ascends → spire collapses. Each step is legible under a Causal lens, anchored by the sundial’s wrong-quadrant shadow that cues the amendment offer. Closure (Earned Stasis for Halcyon, Decisive Change for Vespers) lands with conceptual cost: sky governance forfeited, mentorship transferred. Orientation fixed by line 8; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: the “how to fall upward” rule appears once, late, yet is instantly decisive—feels slightly convenient but is accepted under fairy-tale logic taught on page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the chessboard wrapped in Mara’s cloak becomes a portable archive whose gaps will be filled only by future living bodies—an undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: every walking sentence layers density until the gallery’s stone mouths echo back, re-weighting the stake from personal survival to civic memory. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props, no retroactive knowledge. Orientation is taught early ("the night the palace clocks stopped") and anchor waivers do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because she buried talents—>bookstore traps them—>she must crack her own mirror to free them. The decisive change is on-stage: she speaks the unpronounceable word, the corridor straightens into her childhood road, mountain implodes; cost is the permanent loss of her scrying skin. One minor time-slip: “long ago” seeding is told more than shown, but it pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the village exhales as Marek sets the king upright—cost is the decade of frozen guilt now thawed. Causal chain holds: tapestry decode → labyrinth walk → king righted → time restarts. The platinum fountain mirror-reveal is seeded early; no teleporting props. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights the entire pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked spire expels a feather that recolors her future art; cost is undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo layers density until the pattern breaks with the spire’s fracture. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“canyon of endless echoes”). No causal contradiction; the final image reweights every prior reflection under a new, shared rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the workshop’s deliberate sacrifice crystallizes options—statue healed, vessel lost—under an Accumulative lens where each dotted scar tightens density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality holds; the snapped chains are the visible price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hidden canvas’s “temporary eternity” reweights every prior loss and forecloses Ren’s return. Causality holds: cracked mirror → promise activated → wrong turn → shell → copied micro-canvas → transference; each step shrinks options. Cost is palpable in the final breath-beat of “second heart.” Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence shift from demolition glare to invisible bioluminescent pulse tightens stakes without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: scent, glass, and light repeat with intensifying density until the final prism-scatter reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—options crystallize as the boat turns, the cost is the lifelong transmission she accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the station’s idea lifts while she becomes the geography—cost is the crumbling censer foot and her dissolving stitched body. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of moon-phase weight, bronze dust, and backward-crawling dunes intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. One minor causality fuzz: how “memory” flows through hoses without diegetic setup is accepted under lyric pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the drink reconfigures the premise—silence rejected, communal echo willingly borne—priced by the burning eye lodged in his socket. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence deepens via recurrent “occlude / carry” polarity until the final image inverts it. Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored by rope-ladder descent within 60 words). The textbook-spore mechanics are taught early and paid off when the spoonful is scattered then re-ingested, satisfying causality without late-rule swaps.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the Edelweiss repays the debt, gulls and ferry sounds return, reflection syncs—undeniable cost on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each “gap” observation layers density until the final cadence shift reweights isolation into cleansed solitude. Orientation is swift—opal dock, nautical twilight, stranger’s collapse within 60 words. One hiccup: the handwriting entry “He gives the flower…” feels like a retroactive patch rather than a taught pattern, but it pays off in the loop, so the flaw is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Causal: matrix chip → ants → cavern → doorway, each beat a clear therefore. Orientation is clean by sentence three; the creek rising keeps a live clock. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: the old life is literally washed away while Elias exits. The only drag is a soft explanatory lull (“He understood then…”) that momentarily tells us the magic rather than letting the door’s shimmer re-price his options.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: dream warning → reflection blur → climb → shard reveals self as source → crown absorbs remaining memory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: her name is released to the kingdom precisely because she accepts erasure, a cost legible in the cracked mirrors. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and are re-anchored each floor of altitude without stall. No plot amnesia; every glowing basalt step and coagulating star-drop pays forward to the final burn.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: crushing the pocket-sun releases rather than traps light, reweighting the entire premise. The columella curl’s return charged with Mira’s breath is the visible, felt cost. Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is a “because” leading to the renunciation that forecloses the old commerce. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3 and tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scroll’s dissolution reweights time from ladder to wheel and makes the cost of chronicling legible—she will keep mapping spokes even knowing the map disappears. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the snow’s white ink dissolves her own words, tightening the stake of erasure. Orientation is taught early by the dislocated date on the scroll and pays off when the grave becomes optional, not mandatory.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira rotates the screw to face the float, a visible conceptual cost that reweights time itself into midwifed breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each micro-scratch, gurgle, and fog layer densifies until the final droplet “gasp” reconfigures the stakes. Causality is intact: because she lost scent, she maps metal; because she maps metal, she gifts the screw new orientation. Cost is legible in the final image; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine—fail the childhood timing ➜ brother dies, revisit that timing deliberately ➜ rewrite grief—lands with audible click and visible cost (split quill, rock rising). The single-scene orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the same superstition that killed now releases, the platform literally lighter.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she archives the empty bottle beside the score, a resonant reconfiguration that makes forgiveness an ongoing attunement, not a transaction. Causal chain holds—perfume withheld → spoken apology → ghost solidifies → scent released → engines start—each step narrows her options. Cost is visible: the bottle’s emptiness and the falling tree’s low E are irreversible. Induced current is taught early and pays off at the climax, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “The witness is the witnessed…” reweights identity and ending under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the spiral’s slow grind and final inhalation make the cost legible. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the taught pattern holds; orientation is deliberately disorienting yet pays off in the final implosion, satisfying the waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reversed clocks reweight the premise—time is not traversed but biradial. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (water, key, whistle echo) intensifies rather than causally flips. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of the station and self: “he was no longer the hydraulic clock shepherd but…the space between memory and possibility.” No orientation drift; anchors (fjord, brass instruments) appear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each laser click tightens the fold topology, leading irrevocably to the spiral nexus. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the single Luc who touches her shoulder “stranger’s caution intact” proves grief has been scalpeled away yet identity scarred. No teleporting props; the pointer’s breadcrumb logic is tracked beat-to-beat. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) surface by line 5 and never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mosaic of shards (library, subway dawn sweep, returns desk) taught early by repeating riddle syntax; transitions cleanly signaled by lantern and clover props. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city itself becomes a reciprocal text, the unlit candle hands future risk to an unknown reader—felt cost is the permanent openness Mira embraces. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each found scrawl increases pattern density until meaning flips from escape route to self-mirroring lattice. Orientation clear at word 20; no causal breaks; price legible in dawn-long circulation and relinquished lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: he clips the wires, forfeits the booth, and steps onto the track without destination—an irreversible conceptual repricing of his life-rule. Causal linkage holds throughout: every call deepens the loop-fracturing lesson until the disc’s transfer crystallizes the choice. The “wrong number” inciting beat is motivated by the disc’s unbidden chord, avoiding coincidence-as-resolution. Cost is visible in the final cadence: “the first honest ending I had ever allowed myself to begin.”

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly: she plants the tube and steps into irrevocable loss; the locket’s absence is felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, ink, sunflower, laughter) tightens the stake until the final graft reweights memory from private keepsake to public covenant. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. Minor causality gap: security guard’s deferral feels convenient, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kit boards a real train while the ivy station refigures itself into a living lost-and-found for loneliness. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each story-swap thickens the texture until the canopy mirrors the community into existence. Cost is legible in Kit’s renunciation of the station he built and the clock’s forward lurch that expels him. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and the pattern pays off at exit, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory deposit tightens the emotional stake until the clearing’s hush delivers the resonant reconfiguration. Closure—“quiet blaze inside him kept perfect, fearless time”—is on-page, felt, and irreversible. Orientation is taught early through sonic anchors; no causality break. Cost is legible in the ring’s weight-loss and the sealed clearing. Minor knob: spiral tightening could be one beat sharper to enter 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (garden, seeds, filaments, static fertilizer) layers density until the cadence shift at “warmth rising through the soles of her boots” reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira suspends in gravity-stutter, editing loop now infinite, comfort strange and paid for. Cause-and-effect is deliberately elliptical—effect-before-cause is the anomaly’s rule—but the pattern is taught early and honored throughout. Cost is unmistakable: station power dims, gravity slackens, tomorrow’s child now laughs with her rather than at her.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s ears are retuned, the camera left as perpetual invitation. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each mapped silence subtracts sound-ballast until the single chord erupts—so the lens holds. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: the advisor relinquishes the sealed symphony and his own visibility, dissolving “the way sound does when snow begins to fall.” Orientation is swift; moonlight and harbor name the where/when by sentence two, and the pattern is taught early with the empty camera.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tapestry’s re-weave is a Conceptual Repricing that flips arson from destruction to illumination, carrying felt cost as the real archive collapses behind her. Causal chain holds: each artwork chemically encodes coordinates that unlock the map—smart, taught early, paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. The lens is Causal; because/therefore linkage tightens options until the final image reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each drumming sequence intensifies density of memory-jellyfish until the cadence shift at the lagoon reweights identity. Closure is Charged Poise—she claims a conductor’s stance whose cost is perpetual entanglement. Orientation is swift: resonant quartz bough locates reader by line 3. No causal breaks; even starlight “recognition” is pre-cued by altered electrolytes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth’s true acoustic nature reweights Mira’s seven-year labor, felt cost legible in “her maps had been incomplete.” Causality is situational—storm coincidence opens the door rather than protagonist volition forcing it—but the lens is coherent. Orientation is clean by ¶3; no drive ambiguity at end. Escalation is modest: one harmonic deepening rather than because/therefore chain, adequate for sub-800-word accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the darkness “learns” to cradle starlight, reconfiguring the canal’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the child’s transformed into protected constellation. Causality is accumulative/textural: each shutter placement thickens pattern density until the mirror-fold re-weights darkness itself. Orientation is taught lyrically—cobalt dock, dental mirror, guardian’s silhouette—disorientation waived because the final image relies on that hush. Persistent constraint: her voicelessness and the drifting shutter lattice that must not snag, both shape tactics and image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library exhales, boards move “like rooks,” and the town wakes to moss-between-cracks questions—undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each window display adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is clean—Ellis’s note → Mara’s method → sapling grafted into grotto → windows animate. No teleporting props; the grotto’s magnetic tug is taught early and paid off when real roots entwine iron.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image—floating street, kelp-locked beam, whale-call echo—adds density until the raft city reconfigures life without blades. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lira’s release of the scrimshaw charges the final image with conceptual cost—the island’s old myth dissolves into an unruled horizon. The cost is legible in the line “taking Brine Jack’s legacy with it,” making the before/after legible without causal over-determination.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the planted stems darkening under one real tear reweights the remade hush rule-set; crow + officer + performer each pay a sliver of cost, satisfying felt-price test; causality holds under Accumulative lens—pattern of shavings→feather→planted stems tightens meaning without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lake rewrites itself into wings, borders become “parentheses we forget to close,” and the citizens will taste “quartz music at the backs of their tongues.” Causal linkage holds throughout—each spoken paraphrase directly fractures ice or shifts pitch; no reversal is coincidental. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sonic thaw intensifies until meaning itself is re-weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds density until the final spiral reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—“we are most alive where we are broken”—with conceptual cost legible in the deliberate smashing and planting of broken song. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“glassblower's courtyard tiles”), pattern taught early and paid off in the final colored-rain image. No causal gaps; every rearrangement is a because/therefore response under the barter custom.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens left behind reframes the laboratory from mausoleum to incubator, conceptual cost legible. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of echoing “artificial pilgrimage” dissolves into lived exchange, cadence shift clear. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (laboratory, stabilized grid). Causality is lyric rather than tight because the bell ringer’s question acts as a catalyst beat that instantly rewrites the collective stance—plausible within mythic register but thin on intermediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dissolving the stencil into the final origami reweights “genuinely artificial” into living transformation. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each placed figure thickens pattern rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is delayed but functional—who/where taught by ~140 words and pays off in dome imagery. One paraphrase loop (“coordinates…coordinates”) blurs prop logic slightly but does not break cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the grid reveals infinite regression of exits, foreclosing the fantasy of a single escape. Causal chain holds—each card assignment and tape-snap tightens the lattice until the sigil repeats. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rain-beaded skylight loft”). One minor causality bump: “she realized the map was complete” is slightly declarative; still, the persistent constraint (footprints as data, tin as seal) keeps the lens intact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward-walk exit door and the locket-sized pagoda re-weight memory from purification to gentle carrying, with felt conceptual cost—“too heavy for one person.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift from archival claustrophobia to wasteland openness re-stakes innocence lost. Orientation is taught early through tactile cues (bronze prism pulses) and pays off at exit, waiving orientation penalty. One minor causality gap: how shrinking the pagoda to locket is achieved is elided, but the image’s symbolic repricing keeps suspension intact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira locks her heartbeat inside the vault, trading her visible life for the unshareable hope-stone—a conceptual cost that reweights the world rule-set. The causal chain (stone warms → footage comparison → shadow exits → swallowing the planet) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every beat accumulates luminous regret until the final blank sky. Orientation is taught by ~90 words; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cedar plaque of tail-tip vertebrae reweights her future practice with undeniable social/ethical cost. Accumulative lens holds: each shed layer intensifies density until smoke carries away fraud. Orientation anchored by line 3. Final image—cage left hollow, Aster vanished—makes before/after legible. Cost is visible: she walks back “poorer in pride and richer in doubt.”

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: swallowing the seed reweights the miracle, converts scar to period, and restarts time on a red-sand axis—undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the coffee-ring tunnel, hourglass inversion, and root-braid density tighten until the seed’s return reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“quiet tower at dawn”) and again at 120-word mark—no penalty. Persistent constraint: the serum’s half-life fading telepathy charges the final whispered command, making silence itself speak.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensuous layer (dust, orb glow, projector cough) deepens the stake until the mother-song ruptures the loop. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the letter’s address flips from blank to recipient, reweighting “unused love” with undeniable cost. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, taught early and coherent. No orientation drift; space/time stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s physical extinction rewrites the sky’s rule-set so future artists can “create again.” The causal chain (meteor-sentence → dismantling → sky-rewrite) is unbroken, cost legible in her vanished body. The lyric-accumulative pattern is taught by the second paragraph; aurora threads the final skeleton, reweighting prior motifs under the same lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: clock buried between fleeing/returning seconds, pollen-children marching off with sparks—cost is the guard’s forever loss of midnight and the forest’s unrecoverable past. Accumulative lens holds: each lullaby page, poppy glow, and name sung layers density until the final image reweights meaning. No causality breaks; orientation anchors inside 120 words via palm-on-clock and ember reflection. Persistent constraint—frozen time—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s surrender reweights identity and charges the final copper-tree image with conceptual cost. Causal chain: each translocation scrapes a layer → gear as last flake → refusal to reclaim it → becomes next banyan; the lens holds. Orientation is taught immediately by the canopy awakening. No ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the hound’s self-choice reweights duty, echoed in the ticket-punch star. Under an Accumulative lens the constellation of lanterns–star–howl tightens toward this reprise, but the route to it is a single atmospheric curve rather than a because/therefore chain. The leashed-then-free causality is announced, not dramatized beat-by-beat, so cost is legible only in the final image, not in tactics along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bolt passes hand-to-hand, reweighting silence from decree to inheritance while the fortress “decides.” Causality holds: each prior climb, bolt twist, and breathless ward moment tightens into the final shared stare. The micro-fracture in silence is legible and costly—no voice is restored, yet the ledger of stolen songs is physically transferred.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ink droplet sinking through mist reconfigures both identity and cosmos, undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Causality is immaculate—each marginalium is a because/therefore beat that funnels the pretender to the pellet. The “constellations inhale” anchor is given by line 3 and paid off when they exhale at the end; orientation debt is waived because the disorientation is pattern-taught and serves the final image. No teleporting props, no retroactive rules; the pellet’s logic is established before it becomes the agent of sundering.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain: map discovery → dive → reef-hologram → acceptance holds cleanly; each step because/therefore narrows her options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“gate left ajar” reweights her prior isolation with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no penalty. Lens stays situational/accumulative, coherent to the final tapping beat. One soft spot: the pillars’ sudden data-storage power isn’t seeded; the rule arrives exactly when it solves the mystery, a mild late-cheat that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound and light builds until the shuttle awakens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her departure reweights the rebellion’s lull as “gathered breath” and broadcasts the lullaby; cost is the planet left behind. Orientation is legible inside 120 words. Causality is lyric rather than tight: stone circle → hum → glasses → ignition sigal works as magical logic but is not foreshadowed as a rule; still, the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: because the amber will not open, therefore Nara decodes the kite; because she decodes, therefore she descends; because she descends, therefore she alters the embryo—each linkage tightening options with visible price. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pinking membrane reweights hierarchy itself, foreclosing the council’s breeding lottery. Orientation is locked by line 3, transition count = 1, shards = 2, pattern taught. Cost is palpable in the torch-wax seal pressed to her own heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ripped-away photo and resin-sealed after-image crystallize the before/after without tidy uplift. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each scent-anchored freeze deepens the survivor’s stance—so the final relinquishment feels inevitable. Cost is undeniable: the photograph’s destruction is the price of trading memory-for-resin, and the reader feels the exact moment optimism is re-priced. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (cliff path, railing, pine trunk) remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral-mirror image re-weights the whole quest into perpetual flux, cost paid in drowning surrender. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each shredded card and groaning shelf layers density until the final cadence shift. One transition (library → foundation stair) is legible; orientation taught by ~100 words via pulsing wall and toppling ledgers. No meaningful causal gaps; constraint (lighthouse sinking) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael accepts the desert’s folded-time logic and steps into the ink portal, cost legible in his vanishing glow. Causal chain is thin—why the drone’s dissolution triggers his leap is asserted, not driven—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: ink patterns accumulate meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no penalty. One soft patch: the mother’s disappearance is retro-added motive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: cracked seal → discovery → secret upload → city-wide scandal → re-freeze with grin. Each beat tightens options until the only exit is self-sacrifice. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s sky-lit names reweight the library from tomb to cradle with undeniable social cost. No teleporting props; the dormant network is seeded early (“stolen power”) and paid off in the crawl-shaft upload.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canvas-woven rose reweights her parents’ opposed legacies with undeniably felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: father’s violent trace → literal graft into living stem, mother’s peace ethic → hybrid bloom; the quiet dome seals the transfer. One micro-turn at dawn crystallizes options without soft reset; no teleporting props or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spike-driven fissure reweights divinity from catch to conversation, with “Stay” as the charged cost. Causality holds—silence method → spike act → echo transformed—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“sound wave garden”), waiving penalty. The persistent constraint (warm spike, new tongue) shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a hairline slip: the goddess’s threat-to-silence pivot is slightly under-motivated, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal chain is immaculate: each inscribed line physically warps the glowing ellipse, turning logical contradiction into literal motion. Closure lands on-page—”The story continues” hovering in place of the shattered orbit—with conceptual cost: she accepts that her identity will forever be rewritten, not erased. The projector gears, ink chemistry, and slate floor are anchored by 120 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the splintered rosewood remains in her pocket, a sliver of sunset she can never again use, proof that some tools must break to falsify a false cosmos.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added grain, echo, and color-density reweights the stake of impermanence until the radial storm literalizes the release. Orientation is swift—within 60 words we have grotto, twilight, mist—and the single scene never blurs. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank crumbling flake and lilac-tinted air reconfigure meaning without exposition; cost is felt in the vanished mandala and the empty pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map of forgetting crystallizes a before/after in the plaza and in Asha’s stance, with conceptual cost (she will carry the stone and exile). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tessera placed intensifies the pattern of release, culminating in the dawn image of infinite arms. Causality is clean—vision loops → ethical rupture → physical map → departure. One micro-drag: “They never discovered…” is external exposition that slightly dilutes the poise; if the watch had found only the empty stone, the beat would have landed pure 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each echo layer thickens nostalgia until it crystallizes the ghost’s restored outline—effective Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate (ghost, empty theater, after closing) and the orchard rules are taught by sensory payoff. Causality is metaphoric (echoes → materialization) rather than sequential, but the pattern is coherent and the final bow carries undeniable conceptual cost: he becomes the actor he died as, foreclosing future decay.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The static-shock inciting incident is causal, immediate, and lands by line 3; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the geode on the bench reweights all prior light-path photos into “instructions for thought-shields” with undeniable social cost—hundreds now depend on her discs. The lens (Causal) is held without waver; only the neighbor test and rapid word-of-mouth escalation are slightly telescoped, but the beat still tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the staff now floats, cave walls reroute their colors, and Aera’s dissolved body becomes the audible coastline—cost is the loss of her physical future. Causal linkage holds: because she sacrifices voice, therefore memory becomes transmissible light. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of heat-drain → resonance seed → floating staff satisfies the tightening rule. Orientation anchor (cave, alone, post-human) lands by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cracked prophecy is re-weighted from “world narrows to a thread” to “garment we button together,” with the canyon echo’s refined silence as felt cost. Causal linkage holds: cracked bulb → leakage → cataloging buttons → spiral restring → silence absorbed → jar resealed with choice-weight. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“amber warehouse beneath the cliffs”) and re-anchored at every transition; no ambiguity at closure. Persistent constraint—the tower now “glinted like a needle”—shapes her next offer to the monks, foreclosing a return to sand-turning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: transmission sent, pillbox destroyed, future open but path closed. Causal chain (pillbox → coordinates → transmitter → burst) holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Persistent constraint—scarred face, dead keypad, crushed pillbox—shapes tactics through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sphere distills thirty years into one syllable, reweighting the rule-set so the crossing no longer exists. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“palimpsest promise,” overwritten map) and holds; the final grayscale strip and vanished river are the pattern’s payoff. Causality is maintained: because he threads the fog, the gutters stop, the river rewrites itself, and the fare is exacted. Cost is legible in the coach’s dissolution and the sphere’s weight under the tongue.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the unfired hive hardens without fire, reweighting the rule-set so memory itself becomes kiln. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of bee-wing thrum, wax ghosts, overlapping suns—culminating in a cadence shift where the oasis “exhales.” Cost is legible in the final image: Lin walks on, footprints erasing, carrying the lantern’s fractured light as a perpetual constraint. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but pattern is taught early and paid off at the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative-textural lens: the rose’s last petal → stolen gauge → basement darkness → lavender sprig chain escalates density rather than causal reversals; the final Charged Poise on the parapet reweights “reflect light” from metaphor to lived stakes with the visible cost of the dropped brass tooth and the boy’s pocketed moon.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystalline Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment she aligns the gnomon to write “Alone,” she re-prices solitude from wound to tool. Causal linkage holds throughout—because she refuses the stone-circle symbiosis, she must invent solo cartography; therefore she etches her own shadow. Accumulatively, moonlight, tide-breath, and atomically reflective feathers thicken until the final image releases the cloud-page moon-letter. Cost is visible in the fissure that admits moonlight and in the disappointed fade of the ancient hum.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the twig galaxy dissolves, the red thread beats, and she walks forward “lighter by the exact weight of one thrush’s nest.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (lotus petal, color-thread, paper airplane) layers density until the final image reweights the premise: telling is the connective tissue. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by the second sentence and paid off when the pond tilts its mirror. Cost is legible in the hush of color across still water that answers “We know.”

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—modulated pulses → ionospheric skip → 37 Hz lullaby—and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the town’s loudspeakers hiccup, adversaries lower signs, and “grit…can become a cradle.” Cost is legible in the final image: Lyra presses palm to cooling transmitter, feeling “faintest tremor of returning civility.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; lens holds without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle cut by the compass becomes a literal void in the glass roof, sealing her claustrophobia underground while freeing future maps—cost is the irreversible loss of the nexus. Causal chain holds: ledger clue → organ signal → compass circle → spatial mutiny → shaft opens; each step tightens options. Lens is Causal; because/therefore linkage is clean. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 3; spatial logic tracks throughout. Persistent constraint—she can never return—shapes the final westward walk.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the portrait’s completion reweights the entire cold case and her self-blindness. Causal lens holds—each step because/therefore: ribbon → blood → memory → portrait → treaty handed to detective. Cost is legible: “blood-stiffened ribbon” and his tears. No orientation debt; quarry geography stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky itself becomes a library, refracting Edda’s map—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the Ministry’s secrecy. Causal chain holds: decoded stanza → micro-map → restricted test-zone dive → appeal granted, each step narrowing options. The “Latitude of forgiveness” line lands as the inciting micro-turn; the final etched glass wall is the crystallized image. Persistent constraint: the copper nail (coffin origin) stays pressed to palm, shaping every tactical touch.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each paragraph adds a layer of sonic/emulsion residue until the final image reweights “never” to “maybe.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens-door and light-hand crystallize options with undeniable cost—the violin abandoned, pixels sacrificed. Orientation is taught by sentence-one dusk-photo metaphor, waived penalty. Cost is legible: “she crushed the glass flake,” dust clings, mountain exhales go-go-go.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the burning spiral and traded relics reweight the premise—grief’s loop breaks by willing circulation of the once-static money; cost is the ouguiya itself and the shared fire. Causal chain holds: spiral ritual → shared confession → reciprocal gifts → opposite exits. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One micro turn: Mara pivots from erasure to collaborative rite. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dome dissolving into desert sky, the chronicler’s pulse now carrying the temple’s echo, is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior grief into future lenses for others. The causal chain holds—telegram → star dim → temple inscription → spoken petals → brass healing → tear naming—each because/therefore link narrows options until only mutual bearing remains. Cost is unmistakable: the temple will crumble, the chronicler will keep transcribing insomnia into glass-smooth stories, the boy loses his silence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the spoken confession costs her the last shield of denial and the lake seals the eye, reversing the gyre outward. Causal chain intact—mirror shatters → druid seeks frozen fix → lake refuses → confession spoken → vortex expels her. One transition (shore → root circles) is legible and pattern-taught by mentor memory. The counterclockwise rewind is the decisive change with visible price: her blood in the vine, her name recorded in sap.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hedge-double and voice-in-bark crystallize an ongoing custodial cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cobalt, clipping, scars, eclipse—tightening until the final image reweights the covenant. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (“cobalt glade at dusk,” “metallic hush”) so disorientation serves rather than obscures. The one-line cost (“I would never leave the glade”) is legible but could be sharpened on-page rather than declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sprout’s hum reweights meaning and shows the orchard keeps an unbalanced ledger—conceptual cost is legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of traded memories and glowing fruit tightens stakes without causal reversals, acceptable under that lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words; catacomb orchard, two characters, night corridor are anchored. One causal bobble: “roots tightening like wires ready to trammel ankles” reads as threat, yet never activates; still, the image feeds atmosphere more than plot, so no break.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (bugle humiliation → deposit return → Polaroid → mic repair → quarry broadcast) tightens options because/therefore. Closure lands as Decisive Change: he forfeits solitary appraisal for communal archiving, cost legible in the grille cloth now “part of something larger.” Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the taped envelope feels slightly engineered, not strictly因果.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored sky becomes an hourglass neck and the new plank extends only after Mira inscribes the equation “love/time = home” on a magnetic leaf—an on-page act that reweights the entire physics of transition. Causal lattice holds throughout: because she translates the arbor’s clangs, the seed heats; therefore she hums the lullaby; therefore filings spell “return” and the silver filament climbs her wrist, each beat narrowing options until the only exit is forward onto the plank she creates. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“magnetic arbor…amber with the last light”) and the mirrored sky payoff waives any disorientation penalty. Persistent constraint: every departure demands an arrival somewhere else, a rule that charges the final image and prevents soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon anchored in the creel reconfigures all prior identities into a mutable future, cost paid by the librarian’s self-hollowing. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tidal/moon imagery tightens until the final “sky that had forgotten to end.” Orientation is taught early (“tidal atrium,” “sunken archive”) and pays off at the planted creel. No causality breaks; every beat adds density rather than sequential plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mineral-lit confession layers density until the mirror reconfigures meaning. The crown-acceptance is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options narrow to eternal witness; cost is the irreversible dissolution of her body into crystal. Orientation is anchored by word 78 (“descended alone...”) and the disorientation of the nautilus spiral is later paid off by the spiral of etched dates. No causality break; pearl’s flight and mirror opacity are legible magic-logic taught by prior calcite bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the accordion disappears beneath the arch, reweighting the entire map from evidence of guilt to a navigable river-course; the cost is the instrument itself plus the undiluted reflection she must now carry. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each coordinate recited = one sin released into current, pattern breaks at the final number, water stills, lens crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“ivy-choked platform”) and never loosens. No off-stage resolution; the protagonist’s speech act and forfeiture alone reconfigure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of unspoken-word imagery tightens toward “YOU ARE ITS TONGUE.” Closure—body becomes library wing—lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost: she pays with existence. Persistent constraint (backward watch, gravity flip) shapes tactics. Orientation taught by 30 words; no ambiguity. Cost legible: final line re-exists the books. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the violin’s dissolution reweights the world’s climate and Lira’s identity; cost is legible in the puddle that “reflected neither palace nor emperor, only Lira’s tired eyes.” Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical fragment adds density until the frost-seed cadence ruptures the dome. Pattern taught early (velvet/bruised purple) and paid off. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One persistent constraint—the cereus roots—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes the ferryman by dissolving into the river—cost is the image of her shoes liquefying into color. Accumulative lens holds: each static pattern she harvests tightens the lattice that finally replaces her bones. Orientation is taught early via the repeated nightly pilgrimage; no causality breaks. The ending reweights every prior cosmetic act as self-portraiture—an undeniable conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fused relic sinks through skin, making the valley’s absolved debt physically irreversible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (moth-dust, fermented sap, scallop fossil) layers until the final bell-reconfiguration—held without lapse. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 4; causality is lyric but coherent. Cost is unmistakable: “the valley exhaled… unpaid coins… softened into soil.”

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard, once void, is now “filled with their unspoken grief” and will be returned to the sea—an irreversible reweighting of the premise. Causal linkage holds throughout: because Mira witnesses via the shard, therefore she offers the team the choice, hence certainty is unhooked. Cost is legible in the final line: she takes no payment, only the grief-vessel. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of chime-doubt density tightens once and reconfigures meaning at sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: withheld knowledge → stone drop → ripple images → Marcus sees his own reversal → Elara vanishes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights existence itself; the price is legible in Marcus’s recognition that he too will disappear. One transition, single scene, orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each metaphoric layer (bone dust, bird vortex, arrowhead pulse) deepens density until the final cadence shift—Cael’s rooted feet—crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: “he had become the echo…” reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost, no off-stage sleight. Orientation is taught immediately—canyon lip, bone towers, dusk timing—so the waiver applies. One minor loop: “weathered resolve of his weathered face” is self-paraphrase, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: badge + keystone = dull stone + unbarcoded snow, reweighting wonder itself. Causal lens holds: because he fails upward on mist, therefore he can unstrap badge, hence algorithms lose traceable light. Orientation anchored by 80 words; one continuous scene, one deepening. Cost legible in final image—“darkness felt exactly bright enough”—and persistent constraint (no credentials, no upward path).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Jin surfaces transformed, the pier lamps now burning in chromatic song—felt cost is the archive left behind. Causal chain holds: key → safe → cylinder → chromatic epiphany → renunciation. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor elasticity: the captain’s final sentence functions as retroactive instruction, but it is seeded by the woman’s whisper, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: Lira becomes waveform, a cost legible in the cold slide of coins down her throat and the tower’s folding chrysalis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density rises from static hiss to golden sine waves until meaning collapses into pure tone—so the ending reweights the premise rather than resolving plot.因果链 is interior-patterned rather than event-event, but the story teaches that rhythm early and pays it off. Cost is unmistakable: identity erased, flesh transmuted into antenna for a universe that may never re-inflate.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (quartz dust, copper mirror, paper boat) layers density until the atlas page re-weights into a ledger of sacrifices. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the reaper steps onto borrowed starlight, now pulsed by human cost rather than theft. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ancient observatory at dusk”). One causality hairline: the atlas boat’s keel “cuts the star-sentences until they bled” is poetic but physically fuzzy; however, the beat’s symbolic turn is taught early, so waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip-rate cadence replaces because/therefore turns, pattern taught by 120-word mark, closure reweights meaning when children keep counting after bell cracks—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (“the ocean listens”). Orientation early, transitions legible across seven-day montage. Cost legible in epitaph drip that still births fish; persistent constraint (47-second memory) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each revealed artifact tightens the emotional screw until the final cadence shift reweights memory itself. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her act of tearing and scattering the label visibly forecloses the private-grief option and reopens the town’s story as shared text. Causality is intact: every photograph she chooses to take after the rip is consequence of that on-page renunciation. Cost is legible in the red-rimmed eyes and steady voice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering drop refracts the entire orchard, re-weighting stakes without heat. Causal chain holds—starling coordinates → crystal location → flame reveal → drop hovering—each step narrows options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image: she is “unchanged in form yet rearranged in axis,” a conceptual re-pricing that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the snap of the buckle across the gap reconfigures both futures and the entire surveillance premise. Causal linkage holds—every beat is a because/therefore of trust protocols (stolen signal → must descend → must surrender guardian role). The “sky can hold no more secrets” repricing lands with conceptual cost larger than any physical sacrifice. Orientation is taught early by canopy choreography and radio protocol; no debt incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged guardian steps onto new earth with felt grief-joy-terror, brain-fire metronome inside chest—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds: each history-rewrite shrinks options until the pour-out choice forecloses dual survival. Drive lens is Hybrid—accumulative lyric texture with situational ritual pressure—taught by the second line and coherent at end. One micro ambiguity: “legal guardian” letter appears before we know whose law matters, but the ritual quickly re-anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mill rewrites itself into a self-generating puzzle, Mira accepts perpetual mutation, and the brook’s uphill flow is the visible, irreversible cost. Causal lattice holds: each lever-pull redirects vegetal growth, the midnight riddle answer is foreshadowed by the waterwheel reversal, and tomorrow’s empty envelope is the logical payoff. One micro-turn (seed roots erupt outward, not down) re-vectors the entire architecture; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip: “possibility just born” is used thrice as refrain without micro-choice anchoring the second iteration, a minor accumulative texturality leak.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the tunnel’s final tremor of mirth reconfigures the silence forever, concrete ribs humming with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—because he restarts the blower, therefore the echo multiplies laughter he knows is impossible yet accepts. The empty hourglass at 3:07 a.m. anchors who-when-where inside 30 words; orientation is immediate. No lens ambiguity; every beat tightens the single stake: can absence be given shape?

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces passage, placing the pendant on the ice, a renunciation that costs her the talisman and the certainty it pulses. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost layer, mist breath, and boundary pulse accrues until the final image reconfigures meaning—“the expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur.” Causality is internal yet legible: because she waits without forcing, the boundary thaws just enough to reveal the alternate garden, making her refusal meaningful. Cost is unmistakable: the warm spring garden stays unattainable, the pendant abandoned, uncertainty adopted as companion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: creature scatters lens-dust, sealing nexus and pricing sight. Causal chain holds—blood → frost → ash → vivify—but the “contradiction” pivot (ash meets frost) is asserted, not shown, so cost is legible yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard dissolves, the tower sings, the gorge becomes “pregnant with every voice”—a legible before/after reweighting of silence itself. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each discarded assumption warms the star fragment, magnetically drawing the shard into the coil; the final click is the payoff. Orientation is taught early (“Tower 7”, “lunar perigee”, “transmitter room”) and anchors the surreal logic without debt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: ferry entire, passengers real, Arden frozen on bow feeling “single arrow pointing toward one coherent tomorrow.” Cost is the hourglass turned to frost-glass dust—irreversible loss of future resets. Causal lattice holds: every maneuver (port, steady, reverse) answers heartbeat Morse; hourglass reversal triggers final merge. Lens is Causal throughout—because/therefore links tighten until the last image reweights possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the gallery’s final image (“walls breathing with synchrony”) reweights the premise—connection’s texture is witness itself—cost is the empty spool and her inability to un-see. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each woven pattern densifies the impossible space until the cadence shift at dawn crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught early by disorientation (“walls themselves seemed to breathe”), paid off when the gallery’s aliveness becomes literal. No causality breaks; the thread’s glow is the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal lens holds: because the aliens warped starlight, humanity fled underwater; therefore the instructor teaches edge geometry; because she does, the boy sights a new star. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she surrenders the link yet gains a “navigable void,” an undeniable conceptual cost. The persistent constraint is the missing link itself, shaping her future lessons.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the uploaded ledger can’t be silenced, Hask collapses under undeniable voices, Mira’s hearing-aid silence signals duty discharged. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore. Cost is legible in the crumpled director, the dawn headlines, and Mira’s deliberate battery death.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gold lacquer settles into the codex while the cable’s “hungry” hum drops to ordinary surf, reweighting the entire quest from rescue to remembrance. Causality is retroflex but intact—naming the dead reverses the phase transition because the gold medium was always their residual agency. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via repeating “name→gold→body restored” until the final cadence shift releases the signal back to silence. Cost is legible in the last line: she carries “each syllable a copper strand,” a lived burden that can never be laid down.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    A Decisive Change lands when the narrator cuts himself back into flesh and walks into the snow, paying with perpetual exile from official existence; this moment reweights every prior clerical error as lived miracle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tiny system glitch (mis-typed bit, janitor’s reboot, his own no-zero refusal) layers texture until the ink map offers a physical corridor to step through. Time and place are anchored by the dome hatch and valley roofs; the only transition is the spiral descent, legible under one continuous pressure. Cost is unmistakable: “before the sun can file its own correction” sets an external deadline that forecloses any future hospital reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each texture-sound layer densifies until the air feels pottery-rough. Closure is a Charged Poise—the statue palm releases a bird that never lands, reconfiguring listeners as new carriers. The persistent constraint is the diamond heart still beating inside stone, charging every future touch. Cost is the teller’s life paid to turn memory into migratory flock; the image lingers with undeniable conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s laughter and flint-dust benediction reweight “harmony untamed” from threat to communal love; the arrowhead’s fusion with the moth-creature is the visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of frostbitten confessions thickens until laughter flips the emotional valence. One shard only, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: seed on railing, orchard exhaling, statue waving—options reconfigured, cost felt as “echo of a shell that had learned to beat.” Causal chain (lullaby rhythm → guardian hesitation → glass partition → seed extraction) is intact; no teleporting props. Orientation (who/where/when) is taught in first 25 words; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of inversion (upward blossoms, backward lullaby, shell dissolving) deepens until meaning flips at threshold image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: storm-for-letters swap reweights the entire contraband rule-set; rain short-circuits drones, letters fly, border rifles lower—undeniable social cost on the page. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absent mail → tokens → key → letters—held without leak. Causality: storm-drop causes console speech; tokens cause key; key causes mailbox; each step forecloses options. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (arcade corner, tunnel, fence) taught by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the carpenter seeks silence-as-possibility, therefore he enters the train; because he sings memory, the fragment dissolves into him, reconfiguring the world. The Decisive Change lands on the page—his throat opens to “a new silence—full, round, and singing”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned circus train rusted beneath a sky of misting hush”). Persistent constraint: the halo’s dissolution means he can never again hear silence as absence; this shapes his final purposeful wrong turn.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: infinite-curvature center reweights her earlier “search for where stories live” into responsibility for birthing them—cost is the irreversible shift from discoverer to midwife, felt in the scarf’s glowing tangle. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated hyperbolic imagery and scarf-warmth beats tighten the dominant stake (finding pre-narratives) until space itself folds into obligation. Pattern is taught by 25 % (179°→181°→beyond), transitions legible, no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: scarf now carries ten-thousand-novel light; will shape every future shift she mediates.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each painted contrail layers density until the shutter inhale reprograms the coral shelves, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the archipelago’s erased voices audible forever. The movable horizon as shy animal is taught early; its capture extracts an unnameable memory, paying visible cost inside the final image of the paper-boat mobile now circulate-loaned to patrons.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the scar hums, stars rename, and the name is surrendered—cost is the erased future selves. Causal chain holds: Vega’s warmth → ribbon → DNA key → mirror shatter → ink flood → constellation renaming. Orientation is taught by lyric pattern early (“shadowed nexus under starlight”), paid off when the corridor erases years. No lens ambiguity; accumulative-textural design coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: slicing the mushroom reweights the entire memory-exchange premise under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds because each lost memory corresponds to a prior surrender; the constellations re-form only after she reverses her own habitual offer. Cost is visible in the accordion-sigh of released air and the withering ring—an undeniable environmental price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the circle-mended teacup image reweights the exile rule and carries undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored light, tea-leaf geometry, swing-creak—held to the end. Orientation is taught early (warped doorway, captive 3 pm) and pays off when that slice slips free. Minor waiver: the mentor’s erased name appears only at the final beat, so the cost is felt more by reader retrofit than by on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sapling roots half in dream reconfigure the world-rule, cost is the loom’s destruction and Arin’s perpetual exile. Causal linkage holds: because he captures → must release; Accumulative/Textural pattern of color-droplet motif tightens meaning. Orientation anchors within 120 w; drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in “suddenly older yet lighter.”

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last image of “maps” reframes earlier breaks with conceptual cost (he must keep unmaking masks). Causal lens holds—each because/therefore link from mask fracture → net → knot → released spirit is intact. One soft spot: orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears after the 120-word mark, but the delay is purposeful and pays off in the prism refraction image, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the open chapel door re-weights the premise—silence becomes an inverted map—and the cost is the dead projectors and her relinquishment of footage. Causality is lyric-Accumulative: rain, torn map, and layered frescoes accrue until stillness itself “opens.” Orientation is taught early via the henge vault and projector crate; spatial logic holds. The only causal fuzz is the exact mechanism by which “quietness” triggers the door, but the surreal rule is internally consistent and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: image-density and cadence reweight the stake until the globe’s crack crystallizes release. Orientation is taught immediately—rusted bulkhead, 200 ft of Pacific silence, rebreather bubbles—so the surreal premise is accepted. The narrative thread “snow globe → notebook → cracked globe → settled plane” accumulates meaning each time it recurs, tightening through repetition rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: the plane becomes artifact, the ionic crackle in Mara’s chest turns from distress call to calm acknowledgement—conceptual cost legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the graffiti glyph “open mouth curved into a listening ear” reweights the premise—needs are no longer hoarded but broadcast. Causality holds: because she relinquishes the petals, the moths rise and the city receives the code. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (petal→pigment→moth→broadcast) taught by 25 % and deepens to anthem hue. Cost is unmistakable: the bolt plate is empty, the echo gone, her solitude surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density (cipher pages, coal ash, apricot seed) that reweights the central stake from “Why did he jump?” to “How do I smuggle joy outward?” Closure—Lira remains below, watering the future—lands as Charged Poise; the cost is the forfeiture of her old vertical identity. The orientation anchor (elevator, tenth floor) is clear by line 10; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystalline Conceptual Repricing: the fall itself becomes the proof that “empty spaces remember,” reweighting the premise at the instant of death. Causal linkage holds—each cable pop narrows escape while the filament’s glow certifies the theory her mother died for. The gondola’s final lurch and the kite-release are decisive acts that make the cost visceral on the page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the repeating spool/kite pattern and pays off when the sky itself is reconfigured into memory archive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the painted absence becomes her self-portrait and the library’s enduring soul, cost paid in the demolition that begins as she exits. Causality holds: coin notches → measurement system → sky painted → coin returned doubled with meaning. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation (who, where, when) is taught in the first 120 words and pays off when the tree-library’s identity is revealed mid-text. One hairline slip: the phrase “she understands now” is a touch declarative just before the climax, but it does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship’s lamps blaze anew, crew maps fold into one horizon, Lira’s solitude refracts into shared current—cost is her mother’s fragment consumed in public voice. Causal chain: hopscotch syllables → phrasebook recital → light-feed ignition → starling double-helix → collective destination. Lens holds as Causal throughout; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 60; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain—scrap prophecy → gear test → mirror correction → door opens → mentor room—remains intact; closure (Earned Stasis) turns on healed key that seals exit with audible cost. Orientation established within 120 w via "distant morning" and lift-cage exit; no ambiguity. One mirror-as-storage conceit taught early and paid off. Persistent constraint: exit door disappears, locking him into custodianship. Slight over-reliance on abstract "rhythm" language is the only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early via violet nebula slowing time; each chalk line, dew letter, and bell clang thickens texture until the final violet taste on tongues reweights trust into shared anesthesia. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara dissolves into the nebula, the living chalk “family is the crop…”—cost is the forever-loss of her singular form, exchanged for collective resilience. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 40 words and stay lucid. No causal leaps; even anti-grav seed death is foreshadowed. Persistent constraint: ghost intangibility shapes every tactic—she can only chill, balance, gust.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: her eternal whisper pressed to the pane reconfigures time itself, the price erasure of her own future. Accumulative lens holds—each nested lullaby beat adds density until silence circles back to music; the pane’s final transparency is the visible cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dusk, who and when anchored by line 3. Cause/effect intact—because she sings, midnight retreats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is lean and irreversible: because Mara cannot step on stone, she invents the warmth-ghost trail; because frost clock is live, the hand-print must glow now. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the crystal fossils eternalize her exclusion, a social/ontological cost that reweights the entire rule-set. One transition (cliff rim → final vantage) is legible under dusk tracking. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s refusal to stay and hear the crescendo converts private grief into public instrument, the cost her perpetual exile from the very chorus she created. Causal chain holds—because wind stole the ashes, therefore she molds the chrysalis; because the resin sings, therefore strangers wade out—each linkage tightening options until renunciation is the only intact path. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (sun-warmed boulder, braided ravine). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of casting/returning builds density until the final image reweights memory itself as external, ongoing music.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vendor’s self-erasure reweights the premise—stories begin only where memory ends—and the glimmering parole letters reassemble into the reader’s next first sentence, making the conceptual cost undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bottled absence adds density until the orchard sags, the final shatter reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is taught immediately (“brass doors exhaled their first official breath”) and pays off when the building tilts, waiving any penalty. One micro-turn—realizing she is the protagonist—deepens rather than breaks pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each new memory layer tightens the emotional density until the cadence flips at the coral exchange. Closure is a Charged Poise: the desert’s song is re-tuned, cost felt in her altered gift. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—the contagious touch—shapes every tactical decision and is finally inverted to heal rather than harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage is intact: broken weight → silent elevator → linguistic repair → restored song. The thirteen-chime “secret hour” sets who/where/when inside 40 words, so orientation debt is waived. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wooden elevator-cuckoo spillage re-weights the entire night’s labor and makes the social cost (farmers never alone again) legible. The only reason this doesn’t crack 9.0 is mild causal softening: the elevator’s instant agreeability after one speech feels slightly convenient—no counter-pressure or partial failure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine—helmet → entanglement → lattice → collapse—holds cleanly; the mirror-angle rule is set up early and its failure precipitates the collapse, so the reversal lands with visible price. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s singular flesh returns but carries alien schematics, re-weighting her future. One minor orientation lag: “the chasm breathed cold light” precedes any geospatial anchor, but the lyrical delay is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: inversion → access → kernel mapping → chant risk → tail restored → memory surge, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Archive remembers, but the grotto will reset and she must repeat—cost is the eternal return. The manuscript-page fibers carrying “latent blaze” make the price visible and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove’s hush reconfigures from empty silence to expectancy, the glowing insulator storing anthem. Causality is accumulative/lyric: each strum tightens texture until wood sings. Persistent price—slowed heartbeat, kneeling fatigue, trembling knees—remains legible. Final image (“almost-audible mercy”) crystallizes meaning without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tutor re-frames exile into a larger “game,” a Conceptual Repricing that carries felt cost via the worry-stone dent and the re-defined silence. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each electromagnetic hum layers pattern until the final crystallization—yet the missing on-page act (no student arrives) leaves the decisive change intellectual rather than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clasp becomes a public “lighthouse” whose cost is the lifelong carrying of every named silence; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each frequency deepens the density of hush. Orientation is clear by word 60, causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory beat adds density until the final image reweights ambition into gratitude. Closure is a Charged Poise—the indigo-wrapped journal left for wind-spirits—whose conceptual cost (renouncing acclaim) is unmistakable. Orientation is taught early via “treetop village of Larkspur” and tide reversal, waived penalty. No artifact touches the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of water-threads, echoes, and accelerated arboreal generations tighten the stake of “where resilience comes from.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the sapling prism crystallizes options—Aera becomes keeper, planet stays tested, cost is her private memories now communal. Persistent constraint: the glowing arrow she must carry back, visible price. Orientation anchored within 60 words; no teleporting props. Causality intact via water-flow navigation and arrow-slot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza glass rewires the port into a predictive instrument and Mara carries its forecast “in her mouth,” an undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each wind signature layers density until the glass circle reframes every prior vector; the haze-into-clarity cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early through sensory anchors and pays off at closure, so no penalty. The only drag is the slightly expository “she understood then” line that momentarily spells the pattern instead of letting the recorder-echo enact it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands when Elian ingests the sheet and the aurora bursts back to sky—an undeniable reweighting of civic values. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each color layer strips a protective scale until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by sensory cues within 120 words; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint—bells silent until truth—shapes tactics and charges the final hush-to-song inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the seam widens into a mirror that reframes her failure as stillness-capital, not defeat. Causal chain holds: past misplay → exile → spiral offering → unweaving of self; driftwood markers physically track the tightening. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—flute left glinting, thunder “locked behind her teeth”—a persistent constraint on future song.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the backward press scatters borrowed souls and rekindles stars; the cost—Quince’s newly blank heart—is legible under the accumulative lens that holds from first “vanishing star” to last “release.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant dissolves, Elias steps into myth, and the villagers’ future talk supplies the conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: pendant’s vibration → stranger’s arrival → surrender of the artifact → transformation. One minor tautness: “every relic you’ve carried… were all preparation” is retrospective patch, not dramatized cause, but it arrives after the decisive image, so closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prism is left behind, the car becomes reliquary, and the reader feels the before/after shift—grief is no longer hoarded but released into the spectrum. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost vein, color ribbon, and quartz chime is a density increase that reweights the stake until the final “Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush” crystallizes the new equilibrium. Causality is intact: the warming prism literally rejects the lie, forcing the truthful core that breaks the hush. Cost is visible in the hairline fracture and in the empty seat where her initials melt—an image that makes the conceptual price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared in the first sentence—“fingers remembered… while the shuttle clacked”—and held to the last silent pass of the shuttle; causality is lyrical, not linear, yet every image (thread, amber, puzzle, petal) accretes into the final Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate: who (loom spinner), where (forgotten orchard), when (tonight’s taut silence) within 50 words. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: her name is gone, the orchard rewinds, and travelers hear laughter she can never utter—an Earned Stasis that reweights the entire tapestry of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the silk glows in the shafts, therefore Thistle keeps building; because he builds, the arches descend. One clear transition (surface → mine → surface) is legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: the grounded arch bridge with visible cost—the villagers now trespass where he once worked alone. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her maps from places to consequences, with felt cost (“the copper wire of her veins”). Causal lens holds: shard-flare → loom → locker → cube → resolve. Mosaic pattern is taught by 25% (shard first sings at ~150 words) and transitions remain legible; orientation anchors who/where/when inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity or teleporting props; only a slight over-reliance on lyric summary in the final paragraph keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is Charged Poise: the bottled glass in his gloved palm reweights the whole eleven-year chain, making the tower’s darkness witnessed, not vanquished. Causal lens holds: because the lamp died, therefore he rows, therefore he answers with stone and bottle; no off-stage rescue. Anchor (who/where/when) settled within 40 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final line—heat against bone—without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse dissolves into a white canvas, Lirael’s shadow becomes the first letter—undeniable social/ontological cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each laugh increases density, folds green fire, and reweights the stake until the blank page is inevitable. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation—“print had died and stars still lied”—and pays off at the final presses-of-light. Causality is internal-pattern, not external-event, and that contract is kept without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the collector’s theory is re-weighted into Hoshiko’s stance of self-erasure as teaching method, felt cost in “ready to disappear.” Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of iridescent images thickens until meaning tilts at the final fold. Causality holds; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each captured dream bead lowers ambient sorrow by milligrams, a measurable density shift that culminates in the cedar transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant-turned-tree reweights every prior calculation, cost visible in Mara’s forfeiture of her indexing system. Causality holds without ellipsis breaks; moonlight healing is taught early and paid off at climax. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the keeper’s blood-mica lens reframes the mirror world’s problem as mutual reflection failure, then her canon invitation reweights the rules—cost is the shattered window and scarred ribs. Causal chain holds: lullaby → orchard answers → chorus invitation → dawn erupts. Orientation is taught early—mirror greenhouse, night, mica tool—all anchor by line 4. Single-scene default met; transition unnecessary. No lens ambiguity; final image of “fields that remembered color” reconfigures meaning with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank invitation absorbs Elara, reweighting the rule that absence is the deadliest gift. The cost is legible in the instant the paper turns face-down empty, Vale bows to the hush, and the library perpetuates itself—felt, not explained. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every beat layers sensory density until tranquility literally swells, then collapses into her disappearance. One hairline slip: “months ago” massacre is off-stage ellipsis; because it never seeds present tactics, the past leak feels outline-like, not causal, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the palace mosaics brightening under Mila’s palm reweight the premise—absolution is not received but continuously cultivated. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seeded fragment of loaf intensifies pattern until the city’s forgetting recoils. Cost is palpable—“she tasted crumbs on her lips,” “tears salting the crust”—and the persistent constraint of “tenuous absolution” shapes every nighttime burial. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (Rue des Aubes, palace courtyard) arrive by line 50.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mercury tablet dissolves into the tree, turning measured dreams into “sweet and meaningless” sap—an undeniable social cost that reweights the entire quest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each vow’s decay is a pattern break that intensifies the dominant stake (preserving meaning). Orientation is taught immediately by the frost-laced gloves and brass railing, waived. One hairline slip: “loyalty snapped first” is told, not shown, but the stuttered projection immediately dramatizes the loss, so the causality break is micro-healed within two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mermaid’s drop produces the audible click of trust severing, the cylinder is labeled and shelved, and the protagonist carries a silence "no one could sell back"—cost is felt and irreversible. Causal lens holds throughout: because Father does not come, therefore her hope dies, therefore the fob moves, therefore the phonograph captures the break. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 60 words; no props teleport. Sunrise acts as taught constraint, narrowing options to a single inevitable second.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass turns from seeking to becoming, the seed tastes of all seasons, and her palm bears a brand—cost is felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory taste, forest-election result, and aurora shimmer layers density until the final convergence cyclone reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Causality is internal but coherent: tasting → meeting → merging → bearing weather. One minor ellipsis—how the woman waited—is allowed under lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: 4-7-9 lock → forbidden hatch → mother’s canvas → crystal collaboration → lock snaps open at reversed 9-7-4, releasing the laugh that becomes harmony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait fuses two women into one winged geology, foreclosing the old monetized memory trade. Cost is audible—the lock’s spine-crack and released laughter—persistent constraint now is “blank sheets,” not portraits.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard of map and letter adds density until candor itself becomes the reclaimed water. Closure is a Charged Poise—two silhouettes reflected unafraid in greenhouse glass—whose cost is the irrevocable abandonment of the city’s lie-based survival system. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“greenhouse glass”), transitions are legible across the night’s descent, and the final image reweights every prior filtered breath. No causality breaks; the map’s gap is filled by the archivist’s matching plate, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds a new bronze wedge, glacier drop, or micro-adjustment until the comet’s ionic bow reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sculpture’s glow lingers, the boy’s fist closes—cost is the tuner’s emptied pockets and lifelong labor. Causality is lyric-causal: “because she towed every piece, therefore the sky keeps the tremor.” No orientation debt; anchors (bluff, dusk, comet cycle) are legible by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: K-17’s self-implantation into the rose seed crystallizes a new hybrid being, cost paid in permanent stasis. Causal chain holds: box resists miniaturization → android absorbs box → burn compresses both into one impossible flower. Magnetic-shifting clock is signaled by paragraph 1 and drives every beat; no orientation debt. Final image reweights the premise: nostalgia not as preservation but as combustible seed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (mosaic of voices). Closure = Charged Poise: the courtyard becomes “one vast ear,” options re-weighted without exposition. Cost is felt in the slowed locket-beat merging with sparrows—Mira forfeits certainty. Orientation anchored by word 42; no causal break; escalation = density of rumor & object until breath-held hush.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: swallowing the dance-diagram re-weights vulnerability from weakness to weapon. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each pirouette and dice-cast thickens the pattern until the final snap-open. Cost is legible in the ink bleeding into her bloodstream and the moonlit exhale that seeds a stranger’s body. No orientation drift; dome, shaft, and rise are spatially tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravity pockets collapse, memories disperse, and Miren accepts the role of lantern-keeper—an Earned Stasis with visible cost (dust released, sister’s laughter settling as ballast). Causal chain holds: whale sighting → tracking → chamber ritual → memory dispersal → lantern vigil; no teleports or retro-fixes. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (dock-side, dawn, cold iron) and again at ~100 words inside the salt chamber; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the tightening spiral of sensory density (salt, mist, fireflies) reweights the stake until the final image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence sample adds density until the origami galaxy reconfigures the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—he walks on with the rotating sphere inside, a felt, visible cost. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“solitary summoner knelt beside the quiet brook”). No causality breaks; prophecy swallowed, not solved, so path remains foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seal’s owl blinks and the narrator becomes the next keeper, a before/after legible in the single word “stay” reappearing on the steam. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern of “agreed-upon lies” is taught early and paid off when the narrator knocks on Mrs. Chen’s door to begin the next cycle. The weight of untold stories is felt, yet the tutor’s dissipation is lightly motivated—need “changes,” a rule announced, not dramatized. Still, the ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the lullaby threads into strangers’ throats, the Bureau’s frame is publicly overthrown, and Mara’s grey vision is an undeniable cost. The drive lens is accumulative/textural—pattern of echo, colour-leech, bloom—taught by line 4 and tightened in the final image. Causality is lyric but legible: shell → garden → archive → communal contagion. No orientation debt; space/time held in velvet grip.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the key that “unlocks nothing in this world” reweights her self-made prison with undeniable conceptual cost on the final line, satisfying CR under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: every forged document mentioned earlier tightens the guilt-circuit that snaps when she abandons the thorn. Orientation is clean—sanctuary, night, aurora, dripping stalactites—within first 50 words. No teleporting props; the thorn and key track physically from entrance to exit.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via pattern of returning echoes; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—echo is no longer trap but door that shuts. Orientation anchored by 120 words: who (canyon echo singer), where (switchback trail), when (starlit night). Causality intact: because mother’s echo loops, therefore Lira must finish farewell. Cost legible in final line “life would travel rather than reverberate.”

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final mirror reweights the stake. Closure lands cleanly (Charged Poise: mirror = resolved tapestry) with conceptual cost. Orientation is waived—disorientation is taught early by dream logic and glacier geography—but a thin “because” linkage between the shrine corridor and the safe-find weakens the final tightening turn, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (moon paths, firefly blink, parapet heat) tightens the pattern until the whisk’s inscription reweights the premise; the final spiral of water droplets crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep walking what cannot be seen.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diamond becomes a public conscience, hung to rot the orchard’s lie-fruit. Causal chain holds—shredded confetti → hexagon bark → resonance open → broadcast of lies—with the stillpoint widening as visible cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; no debt. The playback sequence is the tightening beat that forecloses her return to silence. Cost is legible in the browning apples and the Geiger’s scream reborn.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Paradise” gate half-melted, hexagonal scars mapping onto confetti tessellation, and the glass-root spiral are welded to choice: they teach her how to open the earth. The Geiger’s silence inside the stillpoint functions as micro-setting that forces tactics (hum the tone). Sensory hierarchy skews tactile & auditory—exactly what a lone walker would track under dust hiss. Environment directly constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate her own complicity—arrives with the first apple and tightens when her own voice plays back. Escalation is a single deepening: the diamond’s curse shifts from external rumor to internal inventory. Agency is continuous (kneel, hum, hang). Cost is conceptual yet visceral: the orchard rots faster than radiation, proving truth lethal. No reversal, but the cadence shift suffices under Accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme—truth as corrosive sacrament—emerges through the orchard’s inverse Eden: knowledge kills immortality. Subtext operates in silence: the Geiger’s hush is the loudest confession. The final image (brown apples) reweights the Coalition’s glossy lies without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; image does the talking.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s bodily annihilation reweights the premise—prophecy demands the prophet’s shadow become the world’s darkness. The causal chain holds: backward lullaby → cobalt portico → download → global broadcast → self-dissolution. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (“stormlit observatory above clouds… seven years”). One meaningful tightening—hitting “enter” after the final lyric—forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the last beat: “the observatory emptied itself of her presence.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: hologram “We are still becoming” reweights every prior coin and jar. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of bottled sounds tightens until release. Cost is felt—Posy “weightless,” pennies revealed as invitations, not currency. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the marina stays whole, bone restored, but the key’s teeth are gone—persistent price legible on-page; the accumulative lens (pattern of sonic callbacks) holds from first ear-bone shriek to final star-spiral, though a causal purist could wish for clearer because/therefore linkage between bow-strokes and ice-calving stall.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the moon-balanced instant reconfigures magnetic north and social order, cost paid by the compass surrender and the blue-spark boundary. Causal chain holds: moon-path deviation → viaduct pulse → lantern signal; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, winter moon). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern tightens to spiral point—and the final image reweights stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: tally-wall → hidden journal → generational echo tightens moral weight without causal reversals, landing in a Charged Poise where silence is refused. Orientation anchors by line 6, single transition at alcove keeps scope legal; cost is the irreversible outing of systemic guilt ("she would file the story carved into these walls"). Closure effect clear, though father insertion feels like an 11th-hour rule bolt that slightly muddies earlier constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the board refuses mercy, Emil seeks Olya; because Olya warns “the song…may not forgive,” Emil doubles down by coupling mechanical repair with investigative action; therefore the parcel to the journalist and the lullaby to Rowan become twin levers that reconfigure the chaplain’s complicity. Closure is a decisive change—Emil exits the shop having exchanged passive absolution for active sabotage of the execution narrative, paid for with the candle fund and the certainty of dawn’s gurney. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no teleporting props or knowledge. One causal micro-gap: how the folded paper reached Emil overnight is elided, but the beat is not pivoted on that logistics, so the closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: every kaleidoscope twist therefore feeds new coordinates to the Algorithm, narrowing flight paths until “Descend” forces the acid kiss. Mid-story gear-shift from fugitive coordinates to fixed buoy is a legible because/therefore pivot. Closure is a Decisive Change: the bell rings not by clapper but by translator, and the arrow tip’s dulling is the permanent price on the page. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 20.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s paid identity is deleted yet she gains an immortal, distributed voice—cost is felt when her payroll record pixelates. Causal chain holds: hashtag chord → map → crystal → file → self-erasure → pirate broadcast. Orientation is swift—“midnight tube train,” “polar cap farm”—and the disorientation inside the crystal chamber later pays off as the memory flood. One minor lapse: the firewall “bargain” is voiced by an external system rather than a dramatized antagonist, but the offer still narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because she embeds empathy into the sphere, therefore the sea locks and the border becomes bridge. The harbor detour is a motivated ellipsis whose payoff (her reflection trapped, Keeper drowned by returned apathy) lands unmistakable cost on-page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard now tastes of apple not salt—rule-set rewired. No orientation drift; mirror-rule is taught by word 50 and re-activated at end.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parasol tip planted in ice reweights “patience” from delay to usable hinge, felt cost legible in the relinquishment. Causal chain is clean—because she volunteers, she meets boy; because she taps the chime, he steps back—each therefore narrows options. Mosaic shard transitions (marina → gangway → dawn) are taught by repeated sonic motif (horn → chime → ice hymn), lens holds. Orientation anchors inside first 120 words; no teleports or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “bus engine idling” inside his chest rewrites the station’s vacancy into departure, paying the social cost of reopening a family-splitting liaison. Causal chain holds—letter-find → parallel-drawing → graft decision—without soft resets; the burned fragment’s flutter acts as micro-turn that authorizes the final note.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated circling, haptic contact with the parapet, and layering of whispers build density until the “distortion in understanding” delivers the Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (moon-gaze porcelain, dunes, pavilion). Closure lands cleanly—the walker’s withdrawal charges the space with preserved silence—meeting the 9+ quick test, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, holding it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of photograph-arrangement tightens until the dove-image crystallizes; closure is a Charged Poise where the town’s communal exhale reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—lavender field, factory ruins, Saturday rhythm—within first 60 words. Causality is lyric rather than strict: each photo placed adds density until the spiral ‘must’ become a dove; cost is felt in the audible communal exhale, not a private price. No telegraphing or soft resets; the final image lands with undeniable conceptual cost—shared grief turned public art.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sounds layer into a spiral of human moments that reweights the stake from “decode” to “witness.” Closure is a Charged Poise—crystal humming, dictionary opened to “zygote,” Elara walking away—reconfiguring silence into generative memory. No orientation drift; library geography stays anchored through table, gallery, desk. The snowdrop drop is the single tightening that crystallizes inward growth; cost is the recognition that language must now live in voices, not pages—visible on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk mark, tape hiss, and fog dissolution adds density until the final spiral reweights the stake—prophet becomes the sound he seeks. Orientation is clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: tape clicks off, spiral drawn, cost is the knowledge that tomorrow’s self will re-enact the loss. Minor waiver: lens ambiguity at midpoint (causal vs. lyric) but pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (leaf, spinning hand, folding observatory) layers density until the shutter click restructures time itself. Closure—station collapses into the single exposed frame—pays off the camera-as-darkroom metaphor with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early and lands cleanly. Cost is visible: “the photograph now contained every future the station would never reach.”

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jagged vinyl halves never seal, crystallizing the thematic cost that reunify ≠ repair. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each hymned mundane sound layers density until the monitor flattens; the final image reweights all prior motifs with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: Lyra’s shadow is re-united with her, a Decisive Change that reweights the world’s physics. The “closed loops” logic is taught early (orrery rings) and paid off when she walks the Möbius night; cost is visible in the fused key-heart of the automaton. The only micro-slip is that the spoons’ reality-bend is declared, not demonstrated, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds because the final image reconfigures absence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden rewoven, the village gossiping under pear-light, Elara’s cartography of fractures now guiding her next bone-setting season—cost is the permanent loss of her former certainty and the ethical weight of silence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image (mint/iron air, vertebra-sundial, tooth-constellation) layers density until the final image reweights the whole moral ledger. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no causal amnesia; the single transition from bench to briar path is legible and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s vanishing weight reweights “stillness” from personal talisman to communal resource—visible in dandelion-seed light settling on roofs. Causal linkage holds: each polishing circle tightens mist → glass levitates → drop strikes → vortex condenses → mirror forms → memory shafts scatter. The persistent constraint is that true sharing requires self-erasure; the final image of Lira haloed by unnameable calm carries undeniable social cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught within 120 words; drip cadence becomes clock.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ant-shadow over fresh earth reweights the viral confession into a private seeding, cost legible in the surrender of public voice to underground silence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thaw-drip cadence and lichen growth carries escalation; no causal reversals required. Orientation clear by line 4; one soft spatial hand-off (Mira → Elias) is legible. The USB burial is a decisive physical act yet stakes remain atmospheric, slightly thinning the cost ledger. No plot amnesia; image-driven design holds.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each apparition layers density until the pattern breaks with the shell’s return. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s empty pockets but “rustle of pages” inside—cost is felt (refused advance, dissolved characters). Causality intact: deleted sentences literally revive cut figures; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“feral nexus where three tidal channels braid”), no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each sung syllable thickens the rune-glow → spores release → pollen must be caught before moonset. The 17-year wait is anchored by the first tendril-touch at ~80 words; orientation debt waived because disorientation (lost lullabies) is the very problem solved. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the valley’s new song is audible proof that modern minds have been re-priced back into ancestral debt. Persistent constraint—next harvest moon will demand another singer—shapes the final image of branches already heavy with new tendrils.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crater-orchestra beats audibly, options reconfigured—exit path renounced, listener role embraced. Cost is palpable: lifelong stillness, grief kept flammable yet unlit. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of arranged refuse → arranged beats—final cadence shift undeniable. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors taught early via crater, orchard, frost circles.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and honored: each mirrored echo adds density until the silver plate reflects nothing—a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. Causality is poetic but coherent: reverse-feeding silence into the timer literally rewinds time, releasing the lost hours as moths; the final image of “cherries dropping… wearing the clothes of its own absence” lands the cost under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the grotto peels open, the weave rises, and the valley exhales—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration. Causality is causal-lens tight: because she sacrifices her own burden (the sister confession), the lattice restabilizes; the burner’s violet flare is the visible cost. Orientation is secure by line 6 (“bronze grotto under starlight”) and the recursive space rule is taught immediately through “no edges; it curved back into itself.” No teleporting props or soft resets; every tile, thread, and flame is accounted for.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-light, sawdust curls, and kettle steam layer into a density shift that reweights memory’s cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—finished carving on sill, latch hung, skylight reflecting both her face and “empty ring below”—a crystallized moment where containment and release coexist with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality remains intact: each carving cut is because/therefore linked to Emil’s absence. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the frozen lagoon fracture reweights ambition into dissolved emulsion; cost is the undeveloped squares lost forever. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each camera click thickens regret-density until the pattern breaks. Orientation is taught early (steam, 03:17, cloudwater) so no penalty. One causal micro-slip: how undeveloped squares season water is left magical, but the effect is consistent with taught surreal physics and does not rupture cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: because/therefore links are soft, but each sensory layer (“brass birds... beating a cadence”) tightens the stakes of reclaimed wonder. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the birds’ new breeze physically lifts tickets and morally reframes abandonment as repair. The hologram line “Measure what returns” crystallizes the cost—hope now carries an ongoing maintenance burden.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the instant the green fire flashes on the wet brass, the dream is relinquished and the hush becomes keeper, cost legible in the emptied sack and the hollow beneath his ribs. Causality holds: every beat is a therefore-link—failure → flight → offering → stillness. The reflective blocks are anchored to present stimuli (scent, frost, tremor) and tilt the stance. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 3 and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: dropping the sundial into the crate crystallizes Mara’s new stance—she will dismantle monuments instead of polish them. Causal linkage holds throughout: forged log → forged memory → bunker discovery → journal confession → symbolic discard. One soft spot: the bunker’s exact location feels conveniently unearthed (no prior obstacle to finding it), but the coordinate scratched on the sundial was seeded early, so coincidence is minor. Cost is visible: the inherited identity is abandoned on-page, and the final image reweights the premise under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the green shoot through snow reweights heritage as living, not museum property. Causality holds: each knot decoded leads directly to the planting beat. The harbormaster’s lunge is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity is intact. Cost is visible in the cracked bead and the outlaw departure—felt stakes scale to length.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the emptied notebook is an undeniable reweighting of her rule-set, and the garden paths literally spell the new grammar. The Accumulative/Textural lens is held throughout—every paragraph thickens the pattern of “explained absences” until the final cadence releases them as readable text. Orientation is taught by sentence one (“shadowed garden just after the last ship sailed”) and never falters. The single causality seam—the thread morphing into extracted presences—reads as poetic rule, not cheat, because the lyric contract is announced early.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each colored droplet, feather-pin, and soldered filament intensifies the stakes until the ribbon of wind reconfigures the world. The crack of the egg lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost—the palace chains snap, crown unknits, prince accepts descent. No teleporting props; every ingredient is introduced early and paid off. Orientation is taught immediately: “bedraggled prince hung upside-down” anchors who/where/when in nine words.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sand ritual is traded for living forest, crystallizing a before/after stance under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causal links are tight: sand → graft → coin → promise; each step is irreversible, re-weighting memory into growth. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 80 words; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final salute—“neither proud nor ashamed”—which seals the loss of purity and the acceptance of hybrid soil.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the memories dissipate as steam, the geese resume—an image that reweights the whole premise of “trapped” past. Causality is accumulative/textural: each breadcrumb of light thickens the pattern until the final release, cost felt in the hollow box left behind. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when inside 30 words. No lens ambiguity; the sidereal patience motif holds from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sonar ping layers density until the gear’s rhythm marries the garden’s sigh, reweighting the stake from rooted sorrow to transmission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—petals pause, flameless light awakens, exile becomes courier—charged by the beacon dusting to fireflies; cost is the gear abandoned and the crack sealed before it opens. Causality is poetic but legible: hidden ember → gear tuning → shared cool radiance. One micro-turn (stepping off-path) suffices; no meaningful escalation gap.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of ribbon-now-holding-wing-fragments re-weights her profession and the village’s ritual from “finality” to “ongoing transformation.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—poem-shreds on chrysalises build pattern until the swarm reconfigures meaning—felt cost is undeniable, no contradiction. Orientation anchors inside 120 words (greenhouse at dusk, her chisels, migration intent).

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s lowered note re-weights every prior tick as a vow rather than a verdict, and the cost—public time slackens, the ridge may yet widen—is legible in the final image. Causal chain holds: because he carves the missing “r,” the bob must be counter-weighted, therefore the beat slows, therefore contracts thaw. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“inside the clock tower that straddled the ridge”) and the lens (Causal) is held without wobble. No teleporting props; the rake handle’s fishhook-tipped journey from apology to pendulum counterweight is traceable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living world is literally sealed above her, an undeniable cost. The spiral coin, sovereign case, and tapestry drawer chain causally; no prop teleports. Orientation is taught early—velveteen gloom, marble lamb, cobalt silo—so the later vertical moves track cleanly. The only slack is the off-stage “war refugees” reveal; because the cipher is already solved, the cellar feels retrofitted rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cartographer becomes the constraint itself, leaving a question-mark crack that reweights the entire lake. Causal lens holds: each memory surrendered tightens the noose until the final dissolution. Cost is legible in the tattooed door and the child’s later feather—both undeniable, felt artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dust-laden air reweights the Ministry’s rule-set, inspectors inhale banned stories, uniforms shed ash—cost is legible and social. Causal chain (broadcast → inspectors changed) is coherent, but the “why now” hinge (solstice calibration window) is told, not shown, softening the decisive change. Accumulative lens holds: density of rosin, mist, and copper builds toward the airborne chord. Orientation is swift; no seam penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each scattered grain thickens the density of absence until the spiral reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elena at the vanishing point, mask fused to face, powder orbiting like planets—cost is the irreversible foreclosure of ever knowing the full story. Causality is intact: because she grinds the tiles, the chair can finally stop; because the chair stops, the spiral can expand. One soft spot: the paragraph-length reflective block edges past 20 % without a present-tense micro-choice to titrate it, but the pattern is taught early andclosure lands cleanly, so the BRR exception is met.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new layer of evidence (census parchment, opposing ledgers, corpse-sump) deepens the dominant stake—how to remember the plague—until the lead sheet forecloses denial. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“cracked sewer conduit”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crowd’s hesitation reweights the city’s narrative future and Caldera’s own mind settles into a “stratum harder than denial.” The cost is legible in the moment of public scorn and the irreversible burial of her counter-clock.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens immediately—books “loosen spines,” scents layer, syllables rise—so each addition of sensory density is causal under that rule-set. Orientation is secured by word 30 (“autumn,” “library,” “Mara”), and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rosette’s planned disintegration reweights the entire premise, making silence a civic resource rather than mere absence. The single causal micro-turn—her scale stripped to pure interval—pivots stakes from “find the missing tone” to “become the absent tone,” a tightening that costs her voice forever. No teleporting props or retro-patches; every fragrance and moth-wing syllable is seeded and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s tongues and the Ministry’s own uniforms are literally seeded with contraband memory—an irreversible social cost that reweights the premise. Causality holds under a lyric-accumulative lens: each sensuous beat (taste, scent, cut) layers density until the final image of disarmed officers crystallizes the stake. Orientation is taught early via taste-map and celestial clock; no ambiguity persists. The price is unmistakable in the last line—every pocket bulges with future crime.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: because the hive died → tower hums with wasted static → boy brings queen-offering → toll-keeper’s truth-curse forces lie → sky answers → wax re-animates → coins re-mint. Orientation (who/where/when) secured in first 60 words. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: her lie (“no wonder left”) flips the tower’s rule-set, recharging money, hive, gate with new social contract—toll-free, wonder-conditional. Cost felt in coin orbit and forfeited keys; no teleports or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass stills, houses sigh, streetlights blink off—an undeniable before/after charged with conceptual cost (some absences, once named, need no filling). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each fragment, scent puff, and wallpaper curl thickens the pattern until the cadence itself tightens. Causality remains internal yet legible—because she assembles the grammar of displacement, the world re-balances—so the ending feels earned, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the cracked ampoule propagates memory through sugar-weak mortar, reconfiguring the entire drowned court while the sentinel waits beneath the arch. Causal chain holds—droplet → mortar dissolve → statues pivot; cost is palpable in the city-wide shiver and the sentinel’s own mineral skin softening. Orientation is taught by lyric disorientation early and paid off; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: “I walked—no, glided—” momentarily stalls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the staircase begins to forget her after she lodges the chipped die like a key—timeless imprisonment revalued into deliberate erasure. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each blood-stamped step layers density until the staircase convulses; the missing-corner balance is the pattern-break that rewrites the rule-set. Cost is unmistakable—she trades her memory-of-self for the texture she sought. Minor orientation waiver applies (who/where deliberately blurred), but disorientation pays off in the final image.</answer>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The staircase itself is the micro-setting that constrains every choice: perpetual motion dictates her gait, prime-number leaps, and the final negative count. Velvet-thick air and stone that ripples like water charge the closing hand-touch without overt symbolism. Object-as-setting (the dice) doubles as tool and anchor, their chipped edge literally cutting the sigma-blood that rewrites the stairs. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent even as steps fold like paper.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each indigo glyph thickens air until greenhouse becomes a municipal lung; closure is a Charged Poise—the moon sets, bristles dim, and the cost is the now-unavoidable dispersal of lost words into strangers, a social price felt in the hush that follows sirens. Orientation is anchored by line 3, transitions are legible, no prop or image resets.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the opera glass clears, reweighting the premise that culture is preserved behind glass. Accumulative lens dominates—each bread loaf, woven bee, and sung song thickens the texture until meaning flip. The final image of “H for home” carries undeniable conceptual cost: her professional identity is subsumed into the living archive. No causal contradictions; the early mosaic shards knit cleanly under the waterfall lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each yoyo attempt → brick loosening → gear reveal → opposed-torque gamble. Closure is a Decisive Change: he slits the string, lands in the workshop, clocks now forward—cost is the loss of reversed time and spent stone. Orientation anchor (“stood on the slick basalt steps… low tide hiss”) arrives by word 24. No teleporting props; every object state (stone warm → ember → cold crack) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror-fear child accepts the paradoxical note, the clasp falls, and the funhouse collapses into salt—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because the protagonist skewers the photo strip, the bleed-corridor opens; because the clasp is surrendered, reflection is forgiven. Orientation is taught early via condensation-slick mirrors and strobing bulbs, waiving any penalty. One hairline slip: "dream dictionary" mechanics arrive late yet still shape the final tactic, barely keeping the lens coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the raft’s silence is reconceived as groove, the prophet’s earlier fractal sound loops become literal propulsion, cost is the forever-loss of wind-reliance. Causal chain holds: because he layers resonance → therefore micro-breezes → therefore bamboo crown → therefore forward motion. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secured by word 30. No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural design tightens once through cadence shift rather than plot reversal. Minor cap: no persistent physical price is felt by the prophet’s body, only conceptual cost—keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is airtight: tremor→pattern match→cracked note→watchers tilt→city turns→crack reveals mother; each because/therefore linkage tightens options while the gate motive is repriced in the final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gate kept citizens in, not danger out—an undeniable social cost that reframes every prior silence. The 120-word orientation test is waived; early disorientation (“the gate that had rusted shut three seasons ago”) pays off as the thematic pivot. Persistent constraint: once the turtles veer north, retreat carries its own abyss.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bare rosebush and warmed letter re-weight the myth; cost is felt in the torch-escape beat. Drive lens is Causal—each beat narrows options until she vaults the tracks. Orientation is anchored by word 48 ("Platform Three") and the ivy/tile cues remain consistent. The smugglers’ cipher (“unmasking time”) functions as motivated ellipsis; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sealed fissure deepens the pattern of hollow-as-archive until the keystone void becomes Conceptual Repricing—absence itself is repurposed as reliquary. Orientation anchored by line 9; no debt. Closure beat is the palm-press: charge transfers from body to stone, cost is irreversible ink loss + permanent archival stance. Persistent constraint—the drawbridge stays up—shapes her exit without backward glance, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the glyph’s inversion rewrites the catalogue and the city’s origin myth with undeniable social cost—citizens must confront dry-earth truth. Causal chain holds: blackout → stamp legible → bruise pattern → glyph = pre-submergence map → new index column. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final reframing. Cost is legible in “private pressure keeping the false history at bay.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane is a density fold that reweights the stake until the moonstone dust and smoke exit leave the basilica bare. The paradox stair is taught early, paid off when she walks “backward” into dawn’s second replay; closure is the Conceptual Repricing of grief into lanterns that belong to strangers—cost legible in “simply leaving.” No orientation debt; pattern legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s suicide dive re-aims the telescope .003°, trading his remaining life for a village’s survival—cost is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: geode maps → breaker smash → wind shift → drone rerouted. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“floating observatory…three miles above”), waived penalty. One shard, single POV, 738 words—scope clean.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: grandmother’s words → drone pursuit → chip → press → star-map → departure. Orientation is secured by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map’s frequency reconfigures “home” with conceptual cost legible in the final upward gaze. Minor slack: the pilgrim’s off-screen knowledge of Mara’s parents is a grace-note, not a breach.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch hand transferred and the carved true-face in pocket together reweight Elias’s professional lie-craft into an irrevocable stance of confession. Causal linkage holds: the mother’s paid commission → Elias’s nausea → driftwood confrontation → final gift. Orientation anchors (terrace, dusk, shore) arrive within 120 words and serve the closing cobalt-black sky image. The only cost that could be sharper is an on-page verbal confession, but the silent object transfer carries undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: every beat (“because” the moon is waxing crescent, “therefore” wind & mist erase cannon-line-of-sight) tightens options. Orientation taught by line 3 (who=negotiator, where=Greyreach parapet, when=hostage-exchange dawn). Decisive Change: parchment dissolves, rope cast, Kael remains—cost is the physical absence of the pull + the audible absence of splash. Conceptual cost: two coastlines now aim “no longer at each other’s memories”—reweighted reality legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pole light and swell thickens texture until “the widening yes” re-prices prior motifs.

Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the cracked baseball’s empty tomorrow-dated tickets reweight redemption as a turnstile, not a door. The final image—“moonlight soldered its halves with silver”—makes the price undeniable. One causality micro-gap: how the orderly coat enables unchallenged escape is elided, but the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: images and spices accrete to re-weight the stake; closure lands with conceptual cost—fortune rewritten, twin-bodied guardian circling.

Orientation anchored by 60 words; no teleporting props. Cost legible in “texture lingered on his fingertips,” a tactile price.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → conspirators → graphite breach → aether seed → chain-room echo → drifting barges. The blackout’s reversal into beacon supplies a clean Decisive Change with visible social cost (fort “unlocked in every sense”).

Causal chain holds: molt → burn husk → rebuild shelves → dupe Rourke → grant secured. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and never drift. One meaningful tightening—Rourke’s entrance—narrows options and is resolved through plausible institutional leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure earns a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pianist’s renunciation of the immortal loop carries undeniable conceptual cost—she re-enters real time still carrying the broken clock, its hands immobile yet now audibly ticking. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each image-layer (flickering departure board, cloud-roots, celluloid-thin edges) deepens the stake of “waiting as playing” until the final chord reweights it. The muted bell she trades is the persistent constraint that shapes the closing image; the “Onward” destination is legible only because the prior pattern taught that compasses can shift. Cost is on-page: “inside her the compass had steadied” exposes the price of no longer outsourcing direction to absent love.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “luminous doubt” reconfigures the stake—ridge held by agreed uncertainty, not truth—while the erased mentor’s name supplies undeniable cost.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring objects (quill, sparks, sundial) until the final cadence shift into dawn’s gold.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (spirals, eels, star dust) until the sequence’s completion triggers a Conceptual Repricing: patterns are for surrender, not understanding. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“Elias, the elusive eel herder... tidal bluff”), and the cost—Mira’s death as “the last equation”—is legible in the final constellation. The causal chain is internal but coherent: promise → ritual → revelation → release. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: words dissolve into sky-static, reweighting censorship as futile against cosmic archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (scars, timer, stormlight) until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible: her physical absence, erased prints, and reset timer imply sacrifice. Every beat tightens toward this charged poise without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Causal in its duel mechanics, Accumulative in its symbolic layering—and holds it coherently to closure. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end—walking into the chamber as co-authors—makes a before/after legible: rivalry becomes collaboration, with the cost being the surrender of solitary intellectual conquest. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration, and the sundial-brook mechanism pays off a pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the spiral library becomes sovereign space, and “Co-conspirator of light” redefines identity with conceptual cost (shedding solitary reinvention). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (cranes, ashes, moon) that reweight anarchy into collaborative beauty. Cost is legible in the glowing tin of discarded selves and the warden’s impending audit. Every beat tightens toward the final standoff with Rourke, where order becomes resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps offscreen into real night, clock ticking but hands frozen—a resonant reconfiguration where waiting becomes active composition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (clock, compasses, chime) accrue weight until the final image reweights them. Cost is legible in the relinquished safety of “maybes.” Orientation is immediate and sustained; every shard (station, shaft, arbor, film) coheres under atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening pressure through layered imagery (dragon-scale ridge, monochrome canyon) until the climax crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: “luminous uncertainty binds stronger than blind belief.” Cost is unmistakable—the erasure of her teacher’s name—and directly enables the ridge’s salvation. Orientation is immediate (“ancient ridge,” “Calyx,” “pre-monsoon light”), and causality flows via dream logic consistent with established rules. Closure lands with Earned Stasis: Calyx endures as a checker who no longer recalls her origin but embodies its purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: each lace instruction deepens the emotional density until the compass’s glow drains into the pattern. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “teal” hue redefines apology as something between sea and sky—and carries felt cost (unspoken words, erased footprints). Orientation is immediate (“tide,” “islet,” “Kaede”), and the single scene tightens through ritualized action rather than causal turns, perfectly suited to the lyric mode. Every beat advances remembrance as pressure.
