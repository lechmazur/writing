  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered scientific observations that reweight the flood's meaning from drama to data. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when Mara carries "decay in two containers: one shining and violent, one soft and nameless, both equally" cuts off mid-sentence, crystallizing the equivalence between cosmic and terrestrial decay processes. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, post-flood, dust collection) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost manifests conceptually in the greenhouse's "monument to slow repair" and Mara's deliberate emotional suppression.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the ledger's physical decay paralleling the protagonist's release from its encoded path. The closure—choosing to step off the smuggler's route and create a healing space—lands with visible cost (abandoning revenge/justice). The orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's discovery that "the world had never been silent—only speaking in a dialect of heat and light" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (her capsizing becomes her masterpiece). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught thermal translations. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the when ("three months ago").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the undertaker accepts eternal guardianship with clear cost—"his own name appearing on the last blank page." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (underwater fire burning on memory, books breathing) that reweight the dominant stake of giving rest "a permanent address," though the orientation of the underwater library's origin could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with meaningful deepening as the bell transforms from summons to archive, and the arbor from meeting place to living text. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through collective reading of Lila's chronicle, with visible cost in the four-year siege and Lila's death. The pattern of midnight runs accumulates pressure effectively, though the final sentence cuts off mid-action, slightly diminishing the closure's full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the pilgrim transformed from searcher to distributor, "slipping droplets of returned love into pockets, palms, the river's fog." The cost is legible in the released jade bead and empty wrist. The accumulative structure coheres through breathing/love/storage motifs that deepen toward closure. Minor deduction for slightly opaque middle mechanics around the camera obscura's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from designer to "medium," with visible cost in her physical dissolution and reconstitution. The accumulative texture coheres through the garden-as-consciousness motif, and the final image of the sharpened photograph legitimizes her letting go. The orientation anchors (hedge maze designer, living bridge garden) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure follows the liberator from discovering the vault's location through the piano keys to successfully accessing and planting the seeds, with clear orientation and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where liberation becomes secondary to cultivation. The cost is visible in her choosing seeds over escape, though the final image of "counting measures until the harvest" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered imagery (forge, orchard, absences). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara's understanding shifts from fixing the past to accepting "the hollow space inside every future connection," with cost visible in the obsidian shard she carries. However, the conceptual nature of "collecting absences" occasionally strains causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the thief reinterprets her role from stealing to restoring memories, with visible cost in the lighter satchel and heavier jar. The revelation about the hooded woman's past betrayal provides meaningful causality, though the mechanism of portrait manipulation could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara abandons her original plan and leaves the dome as a "lighthouse for future wanderers," with clear emotional cost in her transformation from fleeing to planting hope. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through sensory thaw imagery toward this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Leo walking toward the studio ready to leak his vulnerable footage, crystallizing his stance that "vulnerability is the power source." The DNA revelation drives causal linkage through inheritance-seeking to self-acceptance, though the child's appearance strains believability. Cost is visible in career risk and the "trembling certainty" of his final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle transforms the physical fort into a navigable booklet-map, with clear cost (soldiers' names erased, world replaced). The accumulative lens holds as she catalogs silences until reality itself transposes. Slight opacity around the mechanics of world-to-page transformation prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where J4N-17's understanding crystallizes - thoughts emerge from "friction between what was and what could be." The loop structure serves the accumulative lens well, with each cycle deepening understanding. Cost is visible in the eternal repetition accepted as the price of consciousness. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph 4 to fully establish the loop mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from ticket discovery through lens recovery to collective absolution, with the projector screening serving as resonant reconfiguration. The "freed by honesty" concept lands with visible relational cost. Slight weakness in the convenience of Rico and Jun's presence timing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly - Elara's understanding shifts from master/servant deception to mutual dance partnership, with the garden's impossible apple as proof of their transcendent relationship beyond measurable luck. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (marbles, memories, garden responses) build toward this reconceptualization, though the cost could be more visceral at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Charged Poise closure crystallizes her options - step into alternate timelines or remain in perpetual twilight - with the cost felt in "the angle of her next footstep, slightly offset." The accumulative structure coheres as moth-bat patterns, nexus pulses, and time-sideways imagery converge at the lever scene, though the extended reflection sequence (lines 7-17) slightly dilutes present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the musician discovering meaning through water-damaged images that gradually reveal the ghost's story. The closure—playing "music that existed in the spaces between"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (accepting disruption over harmony). However, the revelation sequence feels slightly mechanical and the ghost's backstory arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly through the truth-stone's expulsion and burial, with visible cost ("4.7 grams of sorrow"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from fever-break to rootlet-piercing to stone-expulsion. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (mountain station, post-fever). The "valley temporarily innocent" closure reweights the protection paradox with earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-taught repetition (three clicks, pause, five) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Jules inherits the physical/spiritual weight of the dead workers. The valve wheel transforms from religious object to industrial key to vessel of confession, with visible cost in the bead-shaped burns and internalized mass. Orientation anchors clearly (Jules, tunnel, after Mallory's confession) and causality holds as each discovery deepens the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through library details and marginalia breeding histories, culminating in Earned Stasis where she accepts eventual dissolution. Cost is legible in "the map would dissolve into dust" and becoming "merely another stone." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the burrow mechanism arrives late without clear setup.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where children perceive "color streaming from their fingertips." The eclipse ritual lands with visible transformation, though the cost remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the historian trades "her final solitude for a world that would spin around the hush of reclaimed places." The three diary discoveries accumulate textural pressure, each deepening the axis metaphor, with visible cost in her transformation. Orientation anchors (historian, silo library, post-human world) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Chen's departure, with the keeper discovering the prophetic fortune coming true ("THE ROCK YOU STAND ON WILL SOON STAND INSIDE YOU"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery builds (lighthouse beam, microdot specs, fortune cookies) toward Chen's transformation. Cost is felt through Chen absorbing the island's essence and the keeper's too-late realization.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where switching off the pedal and leaving it "like a confession that had nothing left to confess" crystallizes the cost of abandoned faith. The accumulative structure coheres through sound layers building to silence. Slight opacity around the possession's nature prevents higher scoring, though the pattern teaches itself early.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with pattern-taught memory mapping that builds toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the conductor she sought to be. The closure lands with conceptual cost (the nautilus crumbling, exhaustion hitting) though the emotional price feels somewhat oblique. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words. The lens holds consistently but the final transformation from mapping to conducting feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught fractures and recursive timeline logic. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael smashes the tablet and walks through the doorway, with cost visible in "offering his weight in exchange for a name." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who Kael is emerges gradually) and the boy-in-room resolution feeling somewhat disconnected from the viaduct journey's established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mara accepting grief as "loud inside her silence," transforming numbness into resonant presence with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering toward this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for the "filament of hush" concept requiring some interpretive work to track its physical/metaphorical duality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through phosphorescent map discovery, backward-writing ritual, and rain tasting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara moves from isolated recorder to underground truth-keeper, with clear cost in abandoning her surface life. The message dated tomorrow creates effective temporal pressure, though the quarantine zone's truth-containing function could be more gradually revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered scent-memory associations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms from avoiding grief to cultivating it. The cost is legible in lines like "Each exhale released a small blue lantern of breath that drifted upward, carrying away a portion of the ache" and his decision to abandon lantern sales, though the transformation's mechanics occasionally blur.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as the piece layers meaning through the rope, grotto impressions, and recurring images of texture/weight. Closure achieves Charged Poise as the narrator crystallizes their stance between the energy beings' offer and Marcus's flight, with cost felt through the weight of the rope and the road ahead. Early orientation anchors who/where/when effectively within the first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Mara deliberately refuses completion, transforming the family tradition from bonfire gatherings to solitary unfinished music. The cost is legible in her walking away from the bowl/seedling setup. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Lira's armor of detachment dissolves into "porous, aching affection." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (scent, static, amber) build toward her transformation. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the pattern of half-truths reweights at closure where "a beginning" replaces her empire of diluted emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - Marisol's act of passing on the locket photo crystallizes the cycle of compassion with visible cost. The pattern of kindness accumulates through fee waivers, envelope delivery, and photo exchange. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library location unclear initially) and the convenience of Beto knowing exactly where to deliver the envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where daily searches layer into community formation, culminating in the revelation that kinship is "enacted like vows renewed each dawn." The closure lands with visible cost (scar on palm) and conceptual reweighting of the entire search. Minor orientation wobble with "rimward colony" and unexplained dust storms costs some clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the interrupted cadence pattern building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira completes her mother's final syllable, paying visible cost (surrendering future minutes). Orientation anchored early (rooftop canals, High Vire), causality holds through magical realism rules. The closure lands with felt cost as she chooses memory over future, though the final studio return slightly dilutes the peak moment's power.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the orchard's renewal and protagonist's acceptance of approaching the limit of loss rather than solving it completely. The glass eyes triggering the mosaic's opening provides causal linkage, and the cost is felt in "ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell." The orientation anchors (cavern orchard, conjurer, ten harvests ago) establish context efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with fragments building density toward resonant reconfiguration when girl acknowledges Elias's presence. The closure ("I see you") transforms isolation into connection with clear emotional cost—Elias's years of hiding end. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (library, dawn, power outage).

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mira's metamorphosis creating "silver-veined leaves, those who looked closely could see the map of Mira's reluctant metamorphosis," showing clear cost in her loss of human form. The accumulative pattern of storm/plant communication builds effectively, though the extended epilogue after line 30 dilutes the closure's immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through rain trails, shell spirals, and monastery imagery that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's insomnia transforms from curse to gift. The closure lands with felt cost through the exchange of painting for spring water and the acceptance of vigilance as necessary witness. Slight deduction for the overly neat sleep resolution that feels unearned given the established chronic condition.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the pilgrim receives transformative sight while the clairvoyant pays with her humanity, crystallizing into the cave itself. The cost is unmistakable—"voice eroding into mineral song" and the vanished entrance seal the irreversibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the transfer scene, though the final park scene slightly dilutes the immediate impact of her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through the trumpet's assembly toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the final note "folded into every doorway like a page finally turned." The cost is visible - trading the promise to archive absence for the mouthpiece. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered confessions that reweight Alden's identity. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—the phantom punch dissolves into paint, the fortress becomes a blank canvas, and Alden chooses arrival over escape routes. The 3:07/4:07 hour structure and tunnel journey provide coherent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara releases the tile for others, having sculpted her "hollow space for reflection" filled with shared centuries. The accumulative structure builds effectively through sensory layers toward this earned transformation. Slight deduction for the extended philosophical framing in the final line that dilutes the immediate power of the calf breaching image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from fragment discovery through technician encounter to threshold crossing, with clear cost (Vey's existence as he knows it). The closure achieves Decisive Change with Vey choosing to proceed into unmarked darkness. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the final darkness sequence which, while resonant, loses some concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with Cassidy successfully obtaining the asylum document through the ink's magic, paying with her memory—a clear Decisive Change with visible cost. The drive lens (Causal) holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Rurik's arrival and the ink's magic system not being fully dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism pays off in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth transforms her forgeries into reality, with visible cost ("heart heavier by one truth"). The closure lands with Aurelia accepting her role as creator of needed pasts, though the orientation anchor "after the town went silent" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist walks toward harbor "stitched from many mouths, shimmering yet solid." Cost is visible in the erasure of official identity and the desperate layering process. The piece teaches its pattern early and maintains coherent pressure through fragment collection, though the ending cuts off mid-sentence preventing full closure assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Arlen's transformation from debunker to acceptance of mystery lands with felt cost in his abandoned certainty. The three universal sounds motif builds coherently toward the revelation about listeners insisting on difference. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (observatory location clear, but Arlen's immediate purpose takes time to crystallize).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the carnival "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved" crystallizing options with felt cost. The overnight reorganization serves as meaningful density shift under Accumulative lens. Deduction for the Syndicate's retreat feeling somewhat convenient without showing their specific confusion beyond "radios crackling."

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the inspector's act of witness—her three photographs become "the only color left of them," with visible cost in the permanent fossilization and her expiring contract at sunrise. The accumulative structure coheres as scientific observation transforms into mourning, with the chemical timer providing causal linkage to the anemones' precise blooming window. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2 (crater inspector, Mount Selene summit, earthrise).

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from diagnosis through repair to launch, with clear cost (village waiting for medicine). The closure lands with the drone reaching the ship - a Decisive Change with visible stakes. Slight deduction for the convenience of Col's perfectly timed color reports without showing his learning curve.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the underground convergence reweights the meaning of origins and maps, with clear cost (the Registry will dismiss it as myth). The accumulative pattern of river words, spirals, and convergence builds coherently. Orientation anchors solidly by line 2. Slight deduction for the convenience of the falcon's death triggering the exact updraft needed.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian becomes the tenth bell, with clear cost (his transparency/dissolution). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through ritual repetition toward transformation. Orientation anchors early and the mythic logic remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the temple transforms from silencing force to perpetual broadcaster, with the lilac-scented signal creating lasting change. The cost is palpable: Mira sacrifices her mother's keepsake and risks death. The accumulative structure builds pressure through the organ discovery, the vial sacrifice, and the temple's awakening, each beat tightening options toward the crystallized moment of rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism paying off in the tower's inversion and field transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas steps onto a "labyrinth traced in light rather than stone," inverting his inheritance with felt cost (leaving the prison-world behind). Minor orientation delay (lighthouse prison context emerges gradually) but serves the dreamlike progression.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the boy's survival and the ghost's dissolution create visible transformation with clear cost—she dissolves to save him. The accumulative/textural lens holds as ephemeral appearances build toward physical manifestation and final sacrifice. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, ghost, boy) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the unfinished final line "Sometimes, when" which slightly weakens the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—the sea's return through Calyx's weaving creates visible transformation with clear cost (his blood, the dissolved plate). The accumulative structure coheres well under the textural lens. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the dried harbor's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the prayer house reconstructs itself and the protagonist chooses permanent residence, with cost visible in "never left the island again." The accumulative structure coheres as bone-threading roots, mirror reflections, and shadow-casting build toward the transformative dawn scene. Who/where/when anchors establish by line 2-3.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as chalk symbols, letters, and memories layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses to remain "unread rather than falsely known." Orientation anchors solidly (arcade, dawn, mail slot) and the closure lands with felt cost as she walks away with "pseudonyms fluttering behind her like torn pages." Deduction for the somewhat abstract middle section that relies on telling about her thirty-year history rather than dramatizing the present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered meanings (embroidery revealing conspiracy maps, nonsense songs naming targets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where wisdom-disguised-as-foolishness rewrites the night. Cost is visible in the lieutenant's trembling hand and the "echoed silence" that replaces conspiracy, though the transformation feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the labyrinth journey building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the apology transforms from unspoken to "seeded." The corridor scene effectively crystallizes the moment of choice with visible cost (the 27 letters becoming moths). Orientation anchors emerge gradually but remain legible; the mystical elements cohere under the story's logic. Slight deduction for the convenience of the medium's exact ability matching the need.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's shift from carrying "shrapnel" to "sediment ready for new growth," with visible cost in the shared birthday and village mistranslation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of "translating footsteps into the quiet percussion of peace still possible." Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (atrium location emerges gradually) and some causality softness in how decoding leads to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Luma realizes "joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed" - this reweights the entire search with felt cost ("each brushstroke cost her a sigh of present sorrow"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory layers build toward the final image of the laughing child refilling the orchard. Minor orientation delay (who/where clarifies late in paragraph 1) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Liora's dissolution into multiplicity reweights the entire premise - restoration becomes perpetual questioning. The nested folding mechanism and the nickel's bargain create clear accumulative pressure. Cost is legible in her loss of singular certainty ("edges soften; she was simultaneously kneeling, walking, and yet unborn"). Minor deduction for density that occasionally obscures precise causality in the middle folding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Arlo successfully plants the first seed and escapes to continue his mission, with seven gardens blooming by sunrise as Conceptual Repricing. The thought-tax worldbuilding anchors immediately and constrains all subsequent action. Minor orientation wobble around the "warp" mechanics slightly dulls mid-story clarity but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Zale's planting of the postcard transforms the cathedral into a living armistice-maker, with clear cost (centuries of longing photosynthesized). The pattern of spiral/shell/nautilus imagery coheres throughout, and the final image of children planting cherry pits without knowing they're "growing armistices" delivers resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density increasing toward Lira's transformation into light. Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira becomes the final extinct feeling, with visible cost in her erasure. The child finding the tube and spreading her note worldwide completes the thematic circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Elara's transformation into part of the symphony carries visible cost (shattering of the ink well, voice transformation). The pattern of silence/sound builds density toward the resonant reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the abrupt cutoff mid-sentence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from problem (conflicting demands) through technical discovery (3.7mm adjustment) to earned compromise (70/30 ratio). Closure lands with visible cost as both factions accept the imperfect solution. The surveyor's chain transforms from boundary to bridge, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mirela's disappearance into bird-carried song fragments completes her transformation from smuggler to memory-preserver, with clear cost (erasure of identity). The accumulative structure coheres through dust mote imagery and musical motifs. Minor deduction for the repetitive "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" phrase that briefly muddles causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught recursion (growth rings as weather codes, drifting terrace as temporal migration) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Juniper steps into the "necessary distance" with clear cost—losing and finding her father simultaneously. The butterfly effect's causal chain from plane deviation to maze transformation provides persistent constraint, though the final dissolution could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the astrologer tears out the star atlas page, creating a "final burnt feather" and promising to "captivate the surface world with stories of what glows beneath"—a clear before/after with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual progression, though early orientation ("three hours before midnight") could anchor more precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the protagonist accepts her role's cost after discovering her forgotten choice. The accumulative/textural lens holds as emotional fossils and seed-planting build toward the final image of new paths forming in foam. However, the cost emerges primarily through retrospective understanding rather than present-scene pressure, and the late revelation of her memory trade weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the bishop placement as catalyst leading to the boy's discovery, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where orchestrated wonder replaces monotony. The final image of Cass dropping the duplicate bishop while the original "remained on the plank, moonlit and waiting" shows clear cost (her anonymity, the effort invested) and reweights the opening. Orientation anchors (boardwalk, arcade, night) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lysira transforms into "forbidden memory" itself, with visible cost in the moonstone dust's sacrifice and physical inscription. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the dance sequence. Slight weakness in the opening's orientation speed and some abstract connective tissue between memory ban and tide dancing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the prism dissolves into healing light across town windows. The accumulative structure coheres through water rings expanding to memory, then to spoken acknowledgment, then to distributed transformation. Deduction for some opacity around "noctilucent reckonings" and the mechanical inventory metaphor that doesn't fully integrate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias transforms from carrying silent guilt to becoming commissioned to speak. The cost is visible (tears, the permanent scar-spiral tattoo) and the ritual creates a before/after shift. Minor orientation wobble with "three years ago" flashback interrupts present momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the grotto transforms, equations spread across timelines, and Mira walks into the tide with "footprints already polished smooth." Cost is visible through the blood offering and abandonment of the safe grotto. The parallel timeline concept maintains coherence throughout, though the mechanism of balloon passage through solid rock strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where density increases through ivy/film/memory motifs until Mira becomes the corridor echo she was hired to trace—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (loss of human form). The recursive structure (finding herself at age seven in the tunnel she's discovering) and the building-as-camera revelation create coherent pressure. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when ("2081" reference helps retroactively).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the painter's transformation from illusion-creator to possibility-reflector serving as Resonant Reconfiguration. The borrowed heartbeat's evolution from "stolen" to "shared" marks decisive change with visible cost (the dying child's gift). Slight deduction for the incomplete ending that truncates the closure statement mid-thought.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story reaches for Accumulative/Textural closure through the ritual accumulation of names and shared grief, but the ending trails off mid-sentence without completing its closure unit. The piece establishes clear who/where/when anchors early and maintains coherent causality through the ceremony, yet the incomplete ending prevents any definitive change, reconfiguration, or repricing from landing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost birds sink into the salt, "becoming part of the land's new memory." The accumulative structure builds through ritual actions (finding egg, winding music box, witnessing ghost flock) with clear cost: "He'd killed their world to keep their echo alive." Who/where/when anchored immediately in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - the city awakens to "raw, alarming serenity" with visible collective transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through echo-memory braiding to dissolution. Deducted for slight orientation delay (sanctuary's purpose unclear until mid-piece) and some causality softness around how exactly the prism's destruction triggers citywide awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lucien's stance crystallization about lettering "questions rather than answers," with visible cost in his lost patronage and the ashes mixed with ink. The magical realism frame (burning stick reverses narratives) is established early and pays off, though the causality between puppet visions and his final understanding feels somewhat mechanistic rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's memorial achieves its purpose by dissolving into migration, with visible cost in her tears and the empty pocket. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through butterfly arrival, culminating in the spiral dissolution. Orientation anchors (grotto, dawn, migration) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator transforms from destroyer to preserver, with visible cost in the tears and the weight of carrying voices. The rope-threading sequence creates clear causality leading to the voices' manifestation, and the final image of names dissolving into rivers completes the transformation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the protagonist dissolves into the storm-path with clear cost ("Lightning unthreads her name; rain rewrites it in shifting syllables"). The wafer seal's transformation from "decaying directive" to living tattoo to final dissolution creates coherent progression. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (protagonist at bunker). Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle section transitions between dream and waking states.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through geometric revelation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Naram-bel becomes "the silence between regimes." Closure lands with visible cost—his physical disappearance and eternal guardianship. The orientation anchors (palace, dusk, astronomer) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds as each discovery enables the next.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught reality shifts and cellular memory accumulation building to Lira's self-confrontation and the shared stillness closure. The shadow-double reversal at "You think you can teach release without first learning it?" creates meaningful cost when Lira must accept her own buried resentments. The final image of three silhouettes against a forgetting horizon with the broken music box left behind completes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - the protagonist's understanding crystallizes into renunciation with felt cost (dismantling his device, accepting limitation). Closure lands cleanly with the workshop transformation. Slight dock for the dream's communication method feeling abstract rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the ribbon's transformation from wage-token to living banner creating genuine Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost (years of tending, ribbon absorbed into bark). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of daughter's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Lira's consumption of the uncarved shell and burning of Quell's memories, with cost visible in the trees blossoming her "possible selves unchained from ancestry." The accumulative structure coheres well through bathroom/truth motif and the pistachio shell's transformation. Slight opacity around the mechanics of "nonlinear inheritance" prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with linguistic and botanical imagery building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara releases absences into the world. The cost is visible: she trades a year of her life, and the library's lessons disperse as "second thoughts" to prevent future errors. The hybrid magical-realist world rules remain consistent throughout, though the precise mechanics of "folding absences" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dissolution motif building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Cassia accepts memory's release. Cost is visible as she walks stepping-stones that dissolve under her weight, trusting ephemeral initials. Orientation anchored early (derelict carnival ship, Blackwater Bay). The ship folding into a pop-up book provides charged final image though the truncated ending weakens full resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing cleanly—the clock striking twelve "prolonged until it became silence" while the door fades shows clear before/after with felt cost. The wax seal's transformation from closed to open door crystallizes the treaty's completion. Slight deduction for dense symbolic layering that occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the "bloom of hush" defeats the energy beings and releases the stored voices. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from silence-as-survival to silence-as-weapon. Cost is visible in the cracked echo chamber stone and the uncertain future ("she might never see"). Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors could be clearer earlier) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance between shards/silence/light that pays off in the final image of "rose glow" promising patterns exist. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as she "became the new prism," transforming from seeker to beacon with clear cost (isolation, responsibility). The quest structure provides clean causality through retrocognitive revelation → desert journey → shard recovery → lamp ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the archivist signing her name "not as owner but as witness," with the fog melting to release memories back into the world. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—she gives up fabric and footprints but no deeper sacrifice registers. The accumulative structure coheres but the final transformation from solid to liquid fog feels predetermined rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (reversed fountains, ascending flames) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Luma transforms from wanderer to star-creator. The closure lands with felt cost as she abandons transcendence to return earthward. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (fortress at dusk, gates open). Minor deduction for the slightly abrupt ending mid-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the tidal metaphor "advancing, retreating, advancing" with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from observation to shared understanding. Deduction for cost legibility - while the emotional weight is felt, the specific price of reconciliation could be sharper at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira transforms from confined to carrying "the stretched sky in every breath," with the porcelain doll as chrysalis marking the change. The accumulative pattern of collecting and releasing silences coheres well, though the pruner encounter feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—Nilo waiting with an empty vial "ready to catalyze whatever noise or stillness the morning would dare to bring" crystallizes his role as perpetual keeper of fears with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the storm glass's phases, crystal formations, and decibel monitoring. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the surreal setting.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting responsibility as bridge between progress/tradition) with visible cost of three centuries' collective memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and pattern reveals, though the final transformation feels slightly unearned given the protagonist's smooth progression without meaningful reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ritual teaching building to a resonant reconfiguration where the boy's dissolution becomes transformative breath. The closure lands with felt cost as the keeper receives "memory of his first real breath, taken in death." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (sanctuary's nature emerges gradually) and some causality softness in how the ritual mechanics actually work.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira throws the diamond into the ocean, releasing both herself and parallel dimensions from debt contracts—visible cost paid through blood drawn from palm. The accumulative pressure of glitch-texts and spore messages coheres toward transformation, though the mechanics of "concepts become physical" could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Arin's name "burned clean" and blood mingling with ink creates a new treaty. The accumulative build through gramophone turning, confession playing, and public revelation coheres under the textural lens. The "jagged star of brass" cutting skin provides immediate physical cost, while identity erasure marks conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where reality shifts create escalating revelations culminating in Sir Calen's transformation from withdrawn to "opening like a bud." The closure—planting the seed and walking into "imminent light"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost through the acknowledgment of past failures now becoming "compost" for future growth.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Rowan discovering the button, reading dust patterns as histories, then placing it in Marcus's file—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the archive from static repository to active hope. Cost is felt through the "missing stair" of Marcus's incomplete record and Rowan's own foster care trauma, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed for the weight it claims.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from receiving the key to discovering the reels to broadcasting reclaimed histories, with clear closure as Mira succeeds in releasing erased voices across the city. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (her capture) and conceptual weight (the city seeing "a new map: not of streets to control, but of voices impossible to silence"). Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the final third that compresses several key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the saxophonist successfully silences the prophecy for today, transforming the "vested hush" into moss layers with clear cost (raw throat, tomorrow's return). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph 2, and the mythic logic remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the naming of "Reciprocity" as the decisive change that transforms the arbor and brings rain. Closure lands with visible cost (the drought-breaking rain with "nettle and iron" taste) and the covenant restored. The pattern of leaf-reading accumulates pressure effectively, though the transformation feels slightly rapid for the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from the compass discovery through the waterfall revelation to Elias's final embrace of uncertainty, with the 3:17 pattern providing coherent linkage. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias choosing indefinite wandering over his workshop, with visible cost in abandoning his trade. The epilogue sections (sailors, tavern, final return) extend effectively but slightly dilute the primary closure moment where he locks the shop.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alder's act transforms personal grief into communal inheritance, with clear cost (accepting permanent loss). The accumulative pattern of kintsugi/breaking/gilding pays off when he releases the rolled silver into the water system. Slight deduction for the incomplete final sentence and minor orientation delay (daughter's disappearance context emerges gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara integrating the laughter transforms her from collector to carrier. The cost is visceral: "warm salt water that smelled of pine and birthday cake" dissolving the tooth, her protective talisman. Who/where/when anchored immediately ("Echo Gorge," "dawn," "lost soul collector"), and the pattern of spectral confessions → harp interaction → integration holds causally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward charged poise at closure—the protagonist walks away with "numbers scribbled along my arms" and the forest's forgetting as partial mercy. Cost is legible through physical pain and the asymptotic nature of forgiveness ("forever approaching zero suffering yet never touching it"). Orientation anchors who/what clearly but "where" remains deliberately vague, serving the surreal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where returning the fragment transforms the narrator from collector to "listener" with visible cost. The temporal loop through the painting creates coherent causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ending line "We keep the light by letting it go" crystallizes the thematic cost effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dust reading that pays off when Mara traces the spiral to the mainspring. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts carrying ghosts forward, with felt cost in the "hairline fractures" metaphor. The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through glass fruit cracking into "ticking numerals," the library folding into a "sigil," and Corwin inhaling the spiral pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Corwin walks the cloud-sea with "pockets full of type slugs," having compressed eternity into negotiable reality—cost visible in the library's destruction and transformation. The orientation anchors (floating library, Corwin as operator, post-Shift world) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure—Aurelio's scratched line on the mirror reweights civilization's collapse as ongoing revision rather than ending. The cost is legible through "blood drying" and the acceptance of being "only footnotes." Minor orientation debt: the relationship between the storm and time visibility could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to restoration with clear cost - Elias must bind his truth to the mechanism. The closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (his confession, completing the lullaby). Slight deduction for delayed orientation (the seven-year darkness context arrives late) though it serves the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Ivy becoming "hinge herself," transforming from collector to conduit with the compass dissolving into her as "a second heart." The cost is legible—she sacrifices her collected petrichor and gains a perpetual whistle that marks her transformation—though the emotional price could be more visceral at the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (shadows, spirals, fleet projections) that culminates in Maela creating a miniature archway that allows communication across ages. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she rows away having chosen intuitive navigation over technology, with cost visible in her "battered skiff" and drowned GPS. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through seasonal progression and recurring night-bloom imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora's painted pavilion becomes a living postcard. The cost is felt through her departure ("walked west... following the melting snow") and the transformation of her artistic practice. Slight deduction for the extended coda that dilutes the closure's immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the lagoon as cipher that trades memory for future, building to Mireya's public broadcast as a Decisive Change with clear cost ("years rearrange inside me," potential crucifixion). The pattern of exchange (shells for vowels, kelp for interrogatives) teaches its logic early and pays off when she accepts her mother's betrayal page. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the final act of reading names over loudspeaker transforms private knowledge into public reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward communal revival, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town transforms its medium of existence. Cost is visible in the ten-year exile and the smashed bottle's finality, though the truncated ending weakens full closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis: Ambrose accepts becoming the foghorn's vessel, with cost legible in his transmutation "into the soft velvet disquiet." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (wax shaving, quince faces, Hittite words) build pressure toward this crystallized stance, though the childhood vision feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts her role as eternal guardian while the oak becomes a vortex doorway—a clear before/after with felt cost ("She would not pass through"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through seed-scattering, heat surrender, and transformation sequences. The orientation anchors (seed saver, icebound atrium, after egg hatches) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the abstract "borrowed time" conceit which, while poetic, occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pressure building through atmospheric details toward Mara's decisive unauthorized test. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bell's six tolls reveal the mountain's voice, with clear cost in breaking protocol. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the janitor's departure with "reopened chest" forecloses his path with clear cost (trading lantern's glow). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through meteor visions to final crystallization. The yellow afterimages and brightening meteors serve as concrete proof of transformation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alden's spoken words seal the fracture and transform the wasteland, with visible cost in breaking his vow. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual repetition and deepening ghost encounters. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (the fire's role clarifies late) though this serves the textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through garage sale descriptions until the final realization that time is exchanged through narrative rather than measured. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the timekeeper understands time as sensory exchange, with the cost being his surrendered fragment. Some causality softness around why numbers suddenly "changed meaning" weakens the opening frame.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the spiral-drawing, musical collaboration, and dissolution sequence that reweights incompleteness from wound to doorway. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when "Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use" transforms the opening's fractured edges into necessary passages, with cost visible in the "net of almosts to keep him gently, imperfectly, alive." Minor orientation wobble with the woman's arrival but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mateo closes the circuit through himself, transforming from architect to architecture. The cost is explicit: his physical dissolution into the network ("future and past became root and branch"). The accumulative structure builds through diary entries and wire installations toward this earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries about the visitors' true purpose as "collectors of belonging." The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—understanding the visitors harvest human emotions—but cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt. The story establishes clear who/where/when early and maintains coherent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the coachman accepts his role and the garden begins. Cost is visible in the "narrow vastness" widening and the permanent transformation of battlefield to garden. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with the riddle-solving providing causal spine while sensory details accumulate toward the transformation of "distance into closeness." The closure lands with visible cost (digging with bare hands, the leaf's transformation) and conceptual repricing as separation becomes "merely a groove waiting for the right nose." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers grief, memory, and impossibility until the final folding corridor creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where death becomes continuation. The cost is legible in "Years later—though years had lost their meaning" and the abandoned jacket, showing Kael's departure from linear time. Minor orientation lag (station's purpose unclear) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Halcyon chooses wonder over rule, the spire dissolves, apprenticeship passes forward. Cost is legible in the spire's collapse and Halcyon's transformation. The accumulative pattern of secrets/shadows/wonder coheres at closure with the child inheriting the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (walking as writing) that pays off in the shared final sentence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the "kingdom of small gestures" with clear cost—accepting permanent displacement. The who/where/when anchors effectively by ~100 words through "whispering gallery beneath the abandoned throne room."

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist's buried talents unfurl when she accepts that home requires necessity over safety, with visible cost in the cracking mercury glass. However, the incomplete final sentence ("unfurl like") undermines closure impact, and some causality relies on abstract concept-work rather than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) lands cleanly: Marek accepts his role as teacher who must also forgive himself, with the cost visible in "lines of his face rearranged." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition builds through tapestry-decoding to labyrinth-walking to final acceptance. Slight dock for the time-freeze mechanism feeling somewhat arbitrary to the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira accepts the cost and transforms her relationship to guilt, with visible change (split spire, feather, doubled shadow). The causal chain from ritual pressure → poetry session → spire response → acceptance holds firmly. Cost is legible in the "doubled shadow" and blood-painting commitment. Minor deduction for slightly rushed middle development where the mirror-shard mechanics could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira accepts death to restore the statue, with visible cost (workshop sinking, her drowning). The accumulative lens holds as pockmark-mapping builds to transformation, though the mechanism of how matching patterns heals marble remains slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror crack catalyzing a journey where each discovery deepens meaning, culminating in Ren's act of preservation that reweights loss as continuity. The closure (placing shell and canvas in the cave) lands with clear cost—abandoning public recognition for private permanence. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the protagonist crystallizes her stance that "the softest voice can travel farthest" while accepting her mother exists on frequencies "too subtle for searchlights." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (heat breaking, perfume, garden scents) toward this reconfiguration. Cost is felt in "everything she couldn't say aloud but would spend her life transmitting anyway."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the navigator dissolves into the place itself, with visible cost ("body the geography others would someday try to navigate"). The accumulative structure coheres through moon phases and cryptic calls building toward transformation. Deduction for slightly opaque causality in the middle ritual sequence where the connection between actions and effects could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently with the orchard's transformation into a living confessional serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist's shift from forager to keeper carries visible cost ("knowing my words would be absorbed, composted"). The glass eyes multiplying and becoming lanterns that "taught us fractured grace" delivers conceptual repricing with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition driving escalation through gaps that accumulate meaning. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Maris releases the Edelweiss, paying with her own memories to break the cycle—visible cost on page. The "Repaid" entry and final image of the dock as "closed eye" effectively reweight prior material. Slight deduction for the middle section's temporal ambiguity around the log entry discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias sees his future self still searching and chooses to break the pattern by leaving the shop unlocked. Cost is visible in abandoning his life's work. The causal chain from inherited promise through matrix chip discovery to doorway revelation holds well. Deduction for the slightly opaque final line's truncation and the conceptual weight of the doorway's revelation requiring more interpretive work than ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen accepts becoming the voice that warns her past self. The closure lands with clear cost ("coronation and erasure"), though the time-loop mechanics strain credibility slightly. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and maintains its dream-logic consistency throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through the shell's transformation from gift to question to shared presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the crushed pocket-sun transforms their understanding without preserving the moment. Cost is felt in the deliberate destruction of Corin's creation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through scroll/grave/eagle layers toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of accepting erasure as continuation. Cost is visible in the grave image and the acceptance of the wheel's splinters. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, mountain) arrive promptly. Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira accepts her loss transforms rather than diminishes her ability to midwife stories. The water clock's "wet newborn gasp" makes cost tangible. However, the revelation about the screw's origin feels slightly convenient, and some connective tissue between discovering the screw and understanding its full story could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual repetition toward Resonant Reconfiguration where breaking the quill releases both memory and method with visible cost. The twelfth-stroke timing creates genuine pressure that pays off when motes transform into readable sentences, though the brother's fall backstory slightly exceeds the 20% allowance without fully anchoring each reflection to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the "imperfect miracle" serving as both method and metaphor for irreversible apology. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mirage accepts the fading of her written confession and abandons her columnist identity—the cost is her career dissolving "like ink from a fountain pen left uncapped." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through musical metaphors and electrical imagery that accumulate toward the final orchard resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where "The witness is the witnessed, the end is the spiral's still center" reweights the entire journey with clear cost (dissolution of self). The spiral pattern teaches itself early and pays off through physical manifestation, though the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain deliberately fluid in service of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where time becomes "something that moved through us," but the cost remains abstract rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure builds through repetitive philosophical observations, yet the closure—Torvald dissolving into pure concept—lacks visible price. The orientation remains deliberately fluid but doesn't sufficiently pay off this disorientation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with topology folds building toward the merger resolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya accepts uncertainty about which Luc is "real," with visible emotional cost. Deduction for the slightly rushed explanation of the farm's true purpose mid-story and the merger mechanics feeling somewhat arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mara's forgiveness and renunciation of the gambling pattern carries visible cost ("no longer tempted to bet"). The cryptic scrawls accumulate meaning toward the mezzanine revelation. Slight dock for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator steps beyond their loop while accepting their role as guide rather than traveler, with clear cost in the handed-over disc and foregone journey. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of loops, calls, and endings build toward the final reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchored early through underground booth setting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the archivist's locket sacrifice transforms memory from personal possession to public covenant, with clear cost in the "empty wrist" and daughter's recognition. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from individual sketching to communal preservation. Slight deduction for the abrupt ending mid-sentence ("motel") which weakens the final beat's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the moon fragment catalyzing connection through shared ritual. Closure lands with "paid in laughter, no change given" showing reciprocal transformation. The cost is felt through their released loneliness, though the magical realism elements occasionally strain causality (the spectral train arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the stillpoint where "sound inverted" and the mapmaker receives his interior cartography. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he accepts becoming the map itself, with visible cost in carrying emotional topography "beneath the skin." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through synesthetic perception and pays it off when "musical notes rearranging into a new melody" he composes by walking.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira accepts uncertainty as "the truest coordinate" with visible cost (the propagating echoes she must meet). The causal chain from planting wrong seeds to garbled signals to editing history holds, though the exact mechanics of "unbending events" remain somewhat abstract. Orientation anchors (station, Mira's role, the anomaly) establish by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara transforming silence into music, creating "an orchestra whose instruments were the spaces between sounds." The accumulative structure coheres well, building from individual absences to composed harmony, with visible emotional cost in her soundless tears.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with symbolic density building toward revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Ember simply walks away carrying the tapestry fragment without sacrifice or trade-off. The archive's convenient collapse removes the need for a decisive choice. Causality weakens when her artistic trail retroactively becomes a perfect cipher she somehow created unconsciously.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara transforms into frequency/light, with visible cost (physical dissolution). The accumulative/textural lens holds as drumming patterns build to transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the experimental treatment context.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the storm, maps, and acoustic discoveries building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth's true purpose as a whisper network is revealed. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the realization that Mira's maps were incomplete because she'd been navigating by sight rather than sound. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing through Conceptual Repricing—darkness discovers it's "made of the same substance" as stars. The pattern-teaching with shutters accumulates toward this realization with visible cost (her lost voice, eternal vigil). Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the who/what.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition ("forests of second thoughts," magnetic grotto) that pays off in the final image of pawns stepping off boards. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the window displays and collective ritual, with visible cost in characters' confessions. Orientation anchors (library, town, after curfew) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (scrimshaw, whale calls, glass orchards) that culminates in Lira's Earned Stasis—choosing freedom over reconstruction duty. The closure lands with visible cost as she leaves the community that needs her, though the "disappearing island" resolution feels slightly convenient. Strong causality in her progression from hearing the whale to building the raft to departing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through whittling, narration, dried flowers, and collaborative carving toward the planted stems receiving rain. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the empty bouquet wrapper becomes "a flag for the morally ambiguous," reweighting grief as something allowed to "weigh something." Cost is conceptual but legible in the transformation from enforced happiness to permitted grief.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake transforms from "moral surface, flat and absolute" to practicing waves, with the poet dissolving into rumor—a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The lens holds consistently as density increases through quartz harmonics, ice calligraphy, and moth patterns building to the final dissolution. Cost is legible in citizens' future uncertainty ("unsure whether they crossed a border or a stanza") and the poet's permanent transformation into rumor.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Milo's transformed understanding that "we are most alive where we are broken," with visible cost in his abandonment of painting. The accumulative/textural lens holds as glass arrangements and plant patterns build toward this reweighting. Slight opacity in the marble eye's mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the laboratory transforms from preservation to creation, with visible cost in abandoning old practices. The accumulative structure builds through repeated imagery (golden shadows, carbide lens) to a clear before/after. Minor orientation wobble with "the others" introduced late in paragraph 6.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure - the protagonist's departure marks acceptance of transformation over preservation, with visible cost in leaving the observatory. The pattern of placing origami figures builds density toward the final reweighting of grief. Slight deduction for orientation arriving late (~120 words) though it serves the mysterious atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through layered ritual actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartomancer discovers "an infinite regression of exits" and seals her work for the next inheritor. Cost is visible in the abandoned skylight loft and her empty pockets. The orientation anchors (cartomancer, loft, post-crash city) arrive within the first 120 words, and the pattern of ritual accumulation pays off in the fractal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she transforms from solitary historian to communal memory-keeper, teaching others to "walk steadily unpredictable paths." The cost is visible in her weathered hands and the burden of carrying "beautiful contamination." Pattern coheres through repetition of key images (bronze prism, saffron veil, atoms) that accumulate meaning, though the archive's nature remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Mira's self-archiving forecloses her path with visible cost—becoming "violet afterimage" future dreamers glimpse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through metamorphosis sequences, though the "shadow unbound" remains conceptually vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with visible cost as Miren releases Aster and accepts being "poorer in pride and richer in doubt." The accumulative structure builds through ritual dismantling (ring, braid, papers) toward reconstruction (cedar plaque with vows). However, the orientation takes too long to clarify the scandal's specifics, and some causal links feel convenient (knowing exactly which merchant sold the feed).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the wound closes "not into a question mark but into a period" with visible cost (blood offering, scar reopening). The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery (hourglass/coffee rings/tunnel). Orientation anchors arrive timely. Cost is legible in the blood exchange and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through film imagery, projection metaphors, and the recurring motif of "unused love." Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers love is "never unused, only stored" and becomes a projector herself, with visible cost in the "envelope ashes" and emotional release. The orientation anchors clearly (projection booth, Mara, abandoned theater) and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the dreamer's dissolution into "a filament of remembered stardust," with clear cost (her physical form). The accumulative structure coheres as astronomical observations build toward creative liberation, though the orientation remains deliberately abstract until the aurora descent grounds the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught lyric compression that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration: the guard's ritual transforms dead children into light-carriers who "march along the horizon" bearing sparks to "the next unlit corner." The cost is legible—the forest burned, the children are spectral, the guard walks away "coat lighter" having transferred his burden. Slight deduction for initial orientation requiring inference about the guard's nature and the world-state, though this pays off in the surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the philosopher becomes "a new banyan that exhaled 3/4 enlightenment," with visible cost (losing individual form). The accumulative pattern of translocation, gear-shedding, and polymeter builds consistently toward this transformation. Minor orientation delay (mechanical rainforest context emerges gradually) doesn't harm closure, which reweights "distributed" consciousness from loss to method.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the hound's self-chosen duty, with clear cost (freedom vs. purpose). The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and repetition build toward the hound's recognition that courage exists within. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for somewhat abstract conceptual cost rather than visceral dramatization at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the "microscopic fracture" in silence and the boy's potential future echo of the bellhop's path. The accumulative lens holds as silence imagery builds toward this crystallized moment. Cost is felt through the "ledger of safety" and visible in the boy's severed vocal cords. Deduction for slightly diffuse escalation that could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the glamour's sundering transforms the pretender into "a stranger wearing ambition for a crown." The accumulative lens holds as cryptic messages build toward the ink pellet's activation, with clear cost in the pretender's complete erasure from history. The piece teaches its mythic register early and maintains coherent causality through the magical system.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira discovers her true role shifts from documenting loss to maintaining readiness for renewal. The cost is clear: eternal solitary witness duty. The revelation about Path 27 and the hidden reef creates meaningful deepening that reweights her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and resonant images build toward the shuttle launch, with the stone circle's awakening providing causal linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she broadcasts the lullaby to crack curfews below, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Nara successfully alters the embryo, fundamentally subverting the council's breeding program with clear on-page cost (physical struggle, risk of capture). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from kite discovery to decoding to embryo alteration. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the narrator chooses continuation "as the trees live, damaged yet upright" with clear cost ("grief ends its dictatorship"). The accumulative lens holds as somatic markers build toward the covenant, though early orientation could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward closure, where Elian's dissolution into "necessary darkness" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("salt sealed his eyes"). The lighthouse's progressive collapse provides structural pressure, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated. Who/where/when anchored early ("forgotten library inside a lighthouse"), and the pattern of rhetorical questions serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through fractal patterns, time-folding theory, and family disappearances toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael chooses conscious wildness. The cost is explicit: surrendering linear existence to join the vanished. Orientation anchors solidly (desert encampment, post-eclipse, tracker searching for sister), and the ink portal mechanics stay consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from awakening to transmission to re-freezing, with Sera's choice creating irreversible consequences ("the conversation would no longer be unspoken"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—the library may burn, but truth is released. The orientation anchors arrive clearly (archivist, frozen library, thawing system), though the worldbuilding occasionally relies on compressed exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Mira's night-long grafting accumulates into the copper-petaled hybrid that transforms destruction into continuity. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she plants this new variety "in the exact spot where her father's airbag had fallen," though the cost could be more visceral rather than conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara realizes divinity requires dialogue not capture, with visible cost in the garden's transformation and the rail spike's warmth. The accumulative structure coheres through sonic imagery, though the orientation of the sleepwalking constellations takes time to anchor spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "Regret that cannot accommodate new truth is not orbit but cage." The transformation from fixed orbit to "spacious sky" carries visible cost through the splintered nib and "empty space where gravity had once insistently tugged." The accumulative structure builds through astronomical metaphor to earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through letters multiplying, the amber dissolving to hologram, and time folding tighter until the final release reweights all prior marking as nodes in haunted firmware. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she walks away with "collarbone quiet at last," showing visible change with felt cost. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (laboratory purpose unclear until paragraph 3) and some causality softness around how the stylus enables the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Mira's understanding shifts from seeking permanent meaning to embracing ephemeral creation cycles. The mandala's destruction and her return to the plaza demonstrate clear cost—she must repeatedly lose her work to find meaning. Orientation anchors clearly (grotto, twilight, the unlearning week).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Asha's creation of the forgetting map and subsequent departure, with visible cost in her abandonment of absolutist ideals about knowledge preservation. The accumulative structure coheres as tessera-gathering builds to artistic transformation, though the three-month retrocognitive setup could anchor more concretely in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure where echoes and sensory layers build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost achieving substantial form through intertwined temporal threads. The cost is visible in Lila's disappearance and the ghost's return to translucency, creating a bittersweet trade-off. Orientation anchors (stage, ghost, after closing) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's shift from isolation to connection-building, with the geode serving as catalyst. Causality holds as the telepathy pills' recall creates context for the geode's amplification effect. However, the mechanism linking recalled pills to the geode's power feels convenient rather than earned, and the story ends mid-sentence ("looked at each"), creating ambiguity about whether closure fully lands.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the fossil transforms from transitional object to "lighthouse without fire," with visible cost (Aera dissolving into rumor). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through heat-mapping to vocal transformation, though the mid-section's memory glimpses briefly strain causality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: prophecy transforms from fear into "thread for anyone brave enough to sew" with visible cost in the cracked hourglass and abandoned post. The accumulative lens holds as button-cataloging builds to silence that teaches collectively, though causality occasionally relies on poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with the transmission completing his arc from silence to confession, destroying himself "a second time" with visible cost. The Earned Stasis ending ("he had finally gone to meet it") lands with felt weight through the accumulated snow imagery and the snowdrop's persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Conceptual Repricing—the coachman becomes "only a man carrying a single drop of every story." The palimpsest promise drives causality from seat inscription through needle-threading to final transformation. Cost is legible in the dissolution of his livelihood (coach) and identity (coachman no longer). Minor orientation delay serves the fog-bound atmosphere without harming comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and recurring images (lantern glass, thrum, kindness) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lin's departure with the child following creates a "covenant" of transmitted memory. Orientation anchors arrive late (potter identity at line 1, but spatial/temporal context emerges gradually), costing −0.4. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the oasis will "vanish again" but kindness becomes phototropically transmissible—though the multi-timeline device occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the boy descends transformed, carrying light into darkness - the cost visible in the fallen tooth and dissolved petal. The accumulative pattern of "pull, lift, glide" effectively structures the narrative arc. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the quagga transforms isolation into self-propulsion, entering a "prairie made of silence" where grass becomes tuning forks awaiting her step. Clear accumulative progression from library to henge to stratosphere to prairie. Deduction for orientation taking until line 4 to establish the POV as the quagga, and some causality opacity in the middle transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira moves from ghostwriter to named author, with the twig spiral's journey from desk to bronze throat marking this shift. The cost—years of self-erasure—is felt in "I have loved for others until my own heart became a palimpsest," though the final transformation could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves closure through Mara's successful broadcast causing the entities to retreat (Decisive Change), but the cost remains abstract—we're told she's their "permanent enemy" without seeing what this means. The causal chain holds but feels mechanical, with key revelations (Professor Haskins' notes, the entities' weakness) appearing conveniently. The orientation is clear early, preventing lower scores.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Arin's acceptance of the spatial mutiny and her transformation from fearing enclosed spaces to carrying "the mutiny inside her." However, the cost of permanently sealing the tunnels feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught motifs (ribbon fragment, masked identity, quarry as crime scene) that converge at closure when the mask discovery triggers town-wide memory. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as painted and tangible Elias unite, with cost visible in the bodies lifted into light. Slight orientation delay (who/where anchored late in paragraph 1) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based decoding building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara chooses to stay and transform the station into a memory archive. Closure lands with visible cost—she could return but sacrifices that freedom to preserve overlooked histories. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph 2 to fully anchor the weather station setting.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the fiddler transforms from isolated mourner to bridge-builder through music. The glass flake's pixelated squares accumulate meaning from photograph to seed to crushed dust, culminating in her stepping onto her father's unfinished bridge "rendered in silver halide and hope." Cost is felt through the father's fall memory and her hesitation, though the transformation's mechanics (how music creates roads) remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery until the final realization that "every circle has an exit if you stop trying to" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The incomplete final sentence effectively charges the closure moment. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some reflection-heavy passages that don't fully anchor to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the temple's grief transforms into shared light, with visible cost in the chronicler's accumulated stories becoming "smooth glass." The accumulative structure coheres well through returning daylily imagery. Slight opacity in the reality-shift mechanics (observatory becoming desert) that doesn't fully clarify its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Briar's confession transforms her relationship to both the lake and herself, with visible cost in the plant binding her arm. The expanding circles method provides structural elegance. Deduction for slightly opaque opening that delays orientation anchors past optimal, though the disorientation does serve the confession theme.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the protagonist accepts becoming part of a new covenant, with the cost being transformation (plant growing from wound). The pattern of dreams-as-maze and scars-as-doors is taught early and pays off. Deduction for slight orientation drift in the middle maze sequence and the abrupt ending truncation ("a reminder that coven—").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—holes now "sang...with the hum I had lost," reweighting the premise that soul-holes need patching rather than purposeful gaps. The orchard's ledger system ("no one left balanced") establishes persistent constraint, and the final image of "two patched souls clinking softly like purses of mixed coins" crystallizes cost through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's acceptance that "being needed" matters more than applause, with the workshop call crystallizing this shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (diesel smell, limestone dust, echo valley acoustics) build toward her stance change, though the cost could be more visceral in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira translates "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape," with visible cost (her mother remains absent, only the pattern returns). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through cuneiform translations building to the final reweighting. Orientation anchors clearly (magnetic arbor, after spirit's departure).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered contradictions until the final image of "water held a sky that had forgotten to end" achieves Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting impermanence while preserving wonder. Minor orientation delay (who/what becomes clear ~150 words in) but serves the piece's lyric mode. The persistent constraint of tidal cycles and moon phases shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Mara becomes permanently transformed into the cave's keeper, with clear cost (loss of human form/life). The accumulative structure coheres through mineral/pearl/confession motifs that charge the final image. Minor orientation delay (cave location unclear initially) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through obsessive documentation toward the paper boat release and accordion's "air release" as Earned Stasis—forgoing the maps for direct acceptance. Cost is visible in "withdrawal tremor" and the coiled rope memory that anchors the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library collapses into the space between letters. Cost is legible in the lost memory of the lullaby and the restoration of the lie, though the final truncated sentence weakens closure impact slightly (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Lira's choice to sing instead of play, transforming destiny into "a garden perforated by paths." The violin melting into a doorway provides visible cost. Causal lens holds as each choice (examining coffee grounds, fracturing violin, singing) builds toward the reconfigured future where citizens wander "choosing songs that would never be sold."

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she dissolves into aurora to preserve the sparks, with visible cost ("she did not sink; she dispersed"). The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-building across seven years of visits, though the orientation remains deliberately ethereal and some causal linkages between harvesting patterns and the final transformation feel implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—the hairpin's emergence in the girl-child creates cyclical renewal with visible cost (the caretaker's death). The grotto sequence builds pressure through transformations and the sap-healing moment. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and causality holds through lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught wind chime cipher building to Resonant Reconfiguration where researchers embrace "protected vulnerability of not knowing." Cost is legible in their shift from certainty to doubt, though the mechanism of Mira's transformation could be more causally traced. The hollow mirror shard functions as a consistent constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the pond rings pattern teaching its logic early and paying off through layered revelations. The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Marcus understands vanishing as "another way of appearing," with cost shown through Elara's literal dissolution. The orientation anchors (grotto, platform, pond) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Cael's transformation from seeker to embodied echo, with cost visible in his physical stillness/rootedness. However, the accumulative lens suffers from repetitive imagery loops (bone towers singing, pulse wandering, endless echoes) that restate rather than deepen, and the transformation mechanism remains vague despite multiple attempts to explain it.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the fractured keystone and glowing petal create visible cost and transformation. The progression from observing automated miracles to discovering/protecting organic wonder lands with felt weight. Small deduction for the incomplete final sentence, though it functions as purposeful elision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Jin becomes part of the spectrum he sought, with visible transformation in the pier lights now burning "with a different tint." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details layer toward synesthetic revelation. Minor deduction for the woman's cryptic instruction lacking immediate causal weight, though it pays off in the drowned library discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's dissolution into signal creates undeniable cost - she literally pays with her atoms. The accumulative structure builds coherently from coins to prophecy to transformation. The backwards prophecy's reversal ("You will forget this" → "You will remember forgetting") effectively reweights meaning. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper's understanding that he exists through accumulated human sacrifice reweights everything, with visible cost in "unlived years stacked like unread letters in his ribcage." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the middle section's pacing slightly dilutes pressure before the powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael's death transforms him from keeper to kept rhythm, with children continuing the count. The dripping rate pattern (47→46→44) provides coherent escalation through density increase. Cost is legible in Kael's lifetime dedication and death, though the final "Not because it makes sense / But because it must" could be stronger without the explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Marisol follows the photograph trail to a resonant reconfiguration where she transforms from solitary guardian to communal storyteller, with visible cost in tearing the label "into tiny blue flakes." The closure lands but the middle section's photograph discovery could tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly through the alchemist's internal transformation—she gains the ability to perceive "the hush beneath the clang" with "wonder now threaded through every calculation." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks and density increases reweighting meaning. Cost is legible in the irreversible transformation that "rearranged [her] in axis." Minor deduction for late orientation of the teacher's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she releases the buckle and accepts letting go, with visible cost in shifting from "sightings" to "releases." The hybrid lens holds, though the older-self reveal strains causality slightly. Cost is legible in the transformation from guarding to releasing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: two beings dissolve into one synthesis parent, with visible cost (loss of individual selves). The custody ritual drives causality tightly through complementary confession rounds. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the transformative merger.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the building transforms into a living puzzle-maker with visible cost (Mira's control surrendered). The accumulative lens holds as patterns (seed, growth, transformation) build toward the final image of the haven writing its own riddles. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, though the time-loop element strains plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the tunnel's acoustic layering, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where absence gains "a shape echoing can carry." The hourglass-to-tunnel-to-home structure creates clear causality, and the cost (accepting loss while preserving memory) is visible. The orientation anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the guardian's gradual dissolution into the garden serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes the frozen rose, sundial, and mist with clear cost (loss of discrete self). The interiorization process builds through concrete stages: breath to commas, statues to memories, finally self to garden. Slight deduction for the cultist backstory arriving late without earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Conceptual Repricing where "failure, when mapped precisely enough, becomes genesis." The transformation sequence and blind walking toward mutual shattering carries visible cost. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors arrive late) costs -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the shard dissolves into "every lost broadcast." The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—silence revealed as protective cocoon rather than threat—with clear cost in the sacrificed star fragment. The orientation anchors (Tower 7, interpreter, lunar perigee) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Arden accepts permanent transience to save both timelines, with the hourglass crumbling to "glass dust that hung suspended." The accumulative structure coheres through phosphorescent barnacles, radio echoes, and timeline flickering, though the exact mechanics of the merge remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with adequate pattern accumulation but lacks a clear cost at closure—the architect "walks away with unsettling calm" without visible price. The orientation remains deliberately vague throughout (who/where/when never anchor), which serves the dreamlike quality but prevents the closure from achieving decisive change with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught "edge geometry" concept that pays off through the boy's breakthrough sighting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the instructor's acceptance that "navigation was no longer about arrival but about refusing to disappear," with visible cost in the chain link's absence creating "a perfect, navigable void." The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words (benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the photograph bridges two women, with Eleanor's heart "finally at rest" - visible emotional cost paid. The causal chain from photograph arrival to atrium visit to reunion is clean. Slight deduction for the abrupt final line cut-off that weakens the closure's full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's successful return of the technicians, with visible cost in her transformed fear from claustrophobia to "the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering." The causal chain from gold fleck discovery through phase transitions to restoration holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (undersea facility, 1987, Mara as spelunker) establish by ~100 words, and the drive lens remains consistently causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the narrator choosing to return to corporeal form and offer wisdom to the clerk, crystallizing his stance that "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor." The cost is visible—abandoning his ghost-existence before dawn's correction. The lyric/accumulative lens holds consistently. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay (the hospital error context emerges gradually) though it serves the mysterious opening.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the storyteller's calcification transforms her into a conduit for the lost language, with visible cost paid through her physical death. The accumulative structure builds through textural layers—from listening to bone towers through swallowing the diamond to final statue form. Minor orientation delays (canyon location emerges gradually) don't harm the closure's power.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Vale's investigation culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes the wraith herself, accepting that "the wraith was never the monster, but the punchline we become when we finally let go." Cost is visible as Vale abandons her old life and literally shatters through the ceiling, though the transformation's mechanics rely heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the orchard transforms from mechanical to organic, with Calla's dissolution as clear cost. The accumulative structure builds through musical layers and reversals (backward lullaby, upward blossoms) that reweight the opening tension. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern teaches its lyric logic early through the locust shell's transformative properties.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from mail delivery through virus deployment to escape, with the thunderstorm serving as calculated diversion. The closure achieves Charged Poise—the virus beginning its work while the protagonist continues the cycle "because emptiness itself can be a message." Cost is visible through the arcade's solidarity blackout and the protagonist's acceptance of perpetual disputed status.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the halo fragment creates a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands through Conceptual Repricing as the carpenter discovers "silence is not absence but an unopened mouth," with visible cost in abandoning his tools for intangible music. The orientation anchors (abandoned train, carpenter, search for fragment) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Calla's transformation from seeker to content guardian, the scarf's dissolution into "invisible filament" marking clear before/after with felt cost. The hyperbolic geometry sequence effectively deepens pressure through spatial distortion. Slight opacity in the middle transformation sequence ("Stories nest where time has no shelf life") momentarily obscures the precise mechanism, though the emotional arc remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the library transforms, voices return, and Mireya's role evolves with clear cost (the palette cracking, color rushing through her veins). The cipher's resolution creates a before/after through the archipelago's restored voices and the dream becoming a lending object.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the locksmith discovering his own hair and integrating it, making visible the cost of centuries of fear. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases. Orientation anchors (locksmith, nexus, starlight) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memory recovery and symbolic accumulation (shipwrecks, mushrooms, sextant). The closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara recovers her memories by refusing the exchange and harvesting the mushroom instead, with visible cost in the "withering" fairy ring and the price of confronting painful loss. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, returning folklorist) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Lira rewrites the exile's terms to allow the child to return without forgetting. The imprisoned afternoon shadow's release and library's exhalation create visible transformation with clear cost (Lira remembering for both). Slight deduction for orientation requiring inference in early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Arin's transformation from hoarder to distributor of wonder creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (aging, loom destruction). The pattern of pruning, weaving, and capturing builds density toward the release moment. Cost is legible when he "suddenly older yet lighter" accepts his wandering role.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mirel releases both the fox spirit and her own constraining vow, with clear cost (abandoning her vocation). The accumulative structure builds through each untied knot releasing trapped words, creating density that reweights the central metaphor of masks as prisons.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the henge's revelation reweights Elara's entire cartographic practice, with felt cost in surrendering mastery for "shielded openness." The accumulative structure builds through film comparison, henge entry, and map reknitting, though the final sentence cuts off mid-thought, slightly weakening the closure's completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mara's transformation from searching to releasing carries visible cost when she leaves her brother's tags in the library. The physics metaphor pays off conceptually ("ice becoming water becoming vapor") with earned wisdom about grief's conservation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lyra releases the petals and the graffiti becomes a communal broadcast. Cost is visible in the dissolution of her echo-self and the transformation of preserved needs into shared experience. Orientation anchors arrive late (courtyard above clouds) but serve the ethereal atmosphere; the pattern-teaching justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught symbols, musical notation, and seed-planting that reweight into expansion metaphor. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's choice to remain below "watering the future," with visible cost of abandoning her position. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2; causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the gondola's imminent fall providing temporal pressure while Mara completes her mother's work. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara becomes part of the sky's memory, with visible cost in her transformation into "dusty starlight." The cable snapping beat-by-beat creates escalating urgency that forces her final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the coin's indentations becoming both guide and archive. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she realizes she's been "painting her own face after all—not as it appears but as it exists in negative space," with visible cost in leaving her work behind. Orientation anchors clearly (artist, tree-trunk library, demolition imminent), though the guild's historical significance emerges late without enhancing closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira's translation literally reignites the ship's fading light, transforming both the vessel's purpose and the crew's isolation into "shared light." The cost is legible in the risk of failure ("*Aurelia* would become a ghost above the clouds") and Lira's physical fear while reading. The accumulative lens holds as patterns (spirals, translations, light) converge meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the hall of mirrors serving as the central transformative mechanism. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Rowan steps through the mirror into his mentor's workshop, with visible cost ("the door locked itself with a click that sounded exactly like a heart finding rhythm"). The pattern of reflection-as-repair is taught early and pays off at closure, though the final paragraph's scope expansion slightly weakens the earned quality of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara dissolves into the nebula itself, becoming a permanent reservoir of respite with clear cost (her individual identity). The accumulative lens holds as her chalk messages, bell-ringing, and orchard-saving build toward collective transformation, with the final image of children feeling "unexplainable trust" paying off the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the adjuster accepts eternal imprisonment to save futures. The nested lullaby iterations and recursive temporal structure teach their pattern early and pay off at closure with visible cost ("body eroding like sandstone into salt"). The orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, lantern room) establish clearly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from Mara's inability to enter → warm impressions → travelers noticing → escape, with the nut's blueprint providing crucial navigation knowledge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("the long walk back to the orchard that kept her prisoner"). The time constraint and mechanical birds create persistent pressure that shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through the braiding motif (water, polymer chains, memory). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara transforms personal grief into communal experience, with clear cost in letting go. The progression from receiving the letter to creating and releasing the sculptures maintains causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through bottle transactions building to the vendor's self-dissolution. Orientation anchors (glass orchard library, vendor, opening day) establish by ~50 words. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost as the vendor becomes the door and customers step through her, though the conceptual leap to "she had been the protagonist" lacks sufficient causality. Pattern holds but the philosophical weight occasionally outpaces dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol's gift reverses and transforms the fortress's stored grief. Cost is visible in her being "subsumed completely" and the century-long wait for bloom. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly pressing palms triggers the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the boundary between mechanical and human breath would remain porous" with visible cost in Mireya's exhaustion and the farmers' emotional response. The accumulative structure builds through linguistic layering and mechanical repair toward the final bridge metaphor ("a bridge is a song you can walk across"), with orientation anchored clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (blood, burned-out mirror, dreams turned to dust) as Mara gains sketches she doesn't remember drawing. The accumulative structure coheres through the canyon's memory-storage premise. Minor orientation delay (who/where clarifies gradually) and some causality softness around how exactly the helmet enables memory extraction prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Ilyra's transformation into "the combination she sought," with clear cost (memory dissolution) legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the doodle's evolution, gravity inversion, and manuscript proliferation, though the "third option" moment could be more causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Ilay's playing transforms both sculpture and grove, with the porcelain insulator storing "the new anthem like a battery." The accumulative structure builds through ritual action, and the cost is felt in seventeen years of silence being broken, though the personal stakes could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the tutor reframes exile as opportunity, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we never see what he risks or sacrifices in this new phase. The accumulative structure coheres around chess metaphors and magnetic imagery, yet the actual change (deciding to teach again) lacks concrete stakes or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mirelle becomes "a walking archive of silences safely converted into song" with clear cost ("Your silence is safe with me"). The accumulative lens holds as frequencies layer toward the diary's opening at 714 kHz. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (workshop location unclear initially) though this serves the atmospheric opening.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the seed grafting creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where "serenity no longer a goal but a companion." Cost is visible in the ten-year commitment and the notebook offering. Slight dock for the abstract opening line that delays orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Aera's understanding transforms from question to embodied answer with visible cost (her memories given to the collective). The gravity inversion provides excellent structural backbone. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of some transitions in the Silent Core sequence, though causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from investigation through discovery to escape. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the port's transformation is complete, and the investigator carries knowledge to prevent future convergences, with clear cost (the town's silence, Marcus's death). The unfinished final sentence "The flight engineer's patch would" feels intentional but slightly weakens the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where wonder becomes "unfettered" with clear conceptual cost—the bell cracks, the aurora dissolves, and the world shifts "slightly on its axis." The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift where "earth itself humming through the colors" reweights the opening's "sculpted hush." Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Kaelen leaves the flute behind, having learned "driven is only half of keeper." The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-teaching ("avalanchingly quiet") and meaningful deepening through the mirror confrontation. Minor orientation wobble with "after the guardianship" lacks temporal specificity but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Quince reverses the press to release borrowed souls, restoring vanishing stars while accepting isolation—"to shine is to be alone together." The accumulative pattern of borrowed personalities → erosion → release coheres, with the halo fragment's seven rays creating new constellations that "spell the emotions he had tried to quantify" as tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with coherent closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's transformation into "part man, part story, part wonder" carries clear cost (loss of ordinary humanity). The auroral ridgeway as liminal space and the pendant's dissolution create effective pressure. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the transformation mechanics and the woman's under-motivated appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as frost patterns, light refractions, and crystalline resonances build toward Elian's acceptance. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he leaves the prism, accepting separation while acknowledging continuing need—cost visible in the "fracture inside him." Deduction for slightly abstract middle sections and "academic heresy" backstory that doesn't alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works: she trades voice for message delivery, transforming into part of the orchard's eternal cycle. However, the cost's exact nature remains somewhat conceptual ("impossible distance") rather than dramatically specific, and the puzzle's arrival feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Corin's resistance transforms both the planet's physical reality (arches now sing) and social order (citizens feel resilience). The causal chain from silk-barter through mural-projection to confrontation is tight. Cost is visible in the risk taken and the "interest" demanded on returned dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through parallel universe exploration to the revelation of complicity and decision to "redirect every future commission toward revelation." The cost is visible in her realization that she was "the instrument, her sensory gifts weaponized." Minor orientation delay in the parallel universe mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the sea glass's warmth traveling "through his glove to the bone"—a physical manifestation of connection despite the tower's darkness. The accumulative pattern of stone messages and sea glass exchanges builds to this moment where absence itself becomes a form of presence, with clear emotional cost in the keeper's continued isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael dissolves with the lighthouse into a new reality of "light printing dawn directly onto the retina of the planet." The closure lands with conceptual cost (dissolution of old reality for new), though some causality feels asserted rather than dramatized, particularly how laughter mechanically transforms reality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery and discovery. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael understands why people magnetize stories and accepts his role, with felt cost in absorbing the donor's memories. However, the story cuts off mid-sentence, preventing full closure assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the sextant transforms into cedar, with visible cost in the astronomer's mapped dreams and quantified grief. The accumulative structure coheres through dream-mapping to instrumental deconstruction to arboreal transformation. Cost appears explicitly: "sorrow index zero, balance restored" after processing centuries of witnessed calculation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the keeper's blood-mica fusion creates a new lens revealing infinite overlapping orchards, fundamentally reweighting the realm's problem from singular decay to isolated reflections. The cost is visceral (chest scarred, memories bled as silver dust) and the accumulative lens holds as density builds through alchemical imagery toward the final image of communities teaching songs. Minor orientation delay (keeper's identity/location clarifies gradually) serves the scattered-memory premise.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elara dissolves into the library's consciousness, with visible cost of surrendering her physical future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with patterns of paradox and presence/absence building to the transformation. The "mistake was never the mis-delivery" realization reweights the entire premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through bread-planting ritual to herbs spelling shop names to reopened bakery. Closure achieves resonant reconfiguration when Mila becomes the gardener with soil under her nails, though cost remains more conceptual than visceral—the "private liturgy against forgetting" lacks a specific price beyond general vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration - the chief's decision to stop measuring and create "Possibility—unmeasured" transforms the archive's purpose with felt cost (the library's "relief"). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density shifts. Slight opacity around the library's agency ("archiving her now") prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fob drops and trust audibly breaks ("a small wet click, like a photograph of my father slipping from my locket heart"), with visible cost in the narrator feeling "lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the breaking point, though the orientation slightly delays (pier location clear, but temporal anchoring soft until "Hours dilated").

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation from tracking to understanding weather-carriers, with visible cost in her "remaining years" dedication. The accumulative structure builds through layered encounters toward this shift. However, the final paragraph cuts off mid-sentence ("The lavender"), and some causality around the "election" concept remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure where the artist transforms from selling portraits to enabling others' creative expression. The cost is legible in her abandoning her profitable skill for uncertain community creation. However, the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain somewhat abstract past 120 words, and some causality feels convenient (the lock spontaneously changing numbers).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from discovery to revelation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira discovers not a place but a practice of speaking the unsent. Cost is visible in the tears and the mother's stored honesty "so honesty could survive the drought." Slight deduction for the truncated ending that doesn't fully crystallize Lira's response to this discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the sculpture's activation by comet, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where wonder becomes a transmittable frequency. The piece teaches its pattern early (mute quarter, metal communication) and pays it off when silence becomes "the resonant cavity." Cost is visible in the thirty-year investment and the tuner's departure, leaving her life's work behind.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where K-17's transformation into the rose's heart reweights the entire narrative, with clear cost in the miniaturization sacrifice. The accumulative structure coheres well through rose/fire/memory patterns. Orientation anchors cleanly establish the desert farm setting and magnetic crisis early. Minor deduction for the conceptual weight outpacing dramatized action in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Earned Stasis closure—Mira accepting the mailbox's need to be witnessed rather than opened—lands with clear cost as she transforms her shop into a receptacle "For whatever returns." The accumulative structure coheres as neighborhood stories layer into collective listening, with the locket's heartbeat serving as the persistent constraint that shapes her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance-as-encryption paying off when Mara swallows the page and her body becomes the seed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (she must carry the data internally, risking herself). The spider's web provides temporal pressure that constrains her choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mael's recovered memory transforms into pigment bleeding into salt formations, establishing that deleted memories migrate rather than vanish. The cost is legible: she gains her name but loses the physical tokens (matchbook, flowers) that enabled recovery. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2-3.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the summoner accepts carrying the prophecy internally ("terrestrially cosmic, a living parentheses around the unsaid"). The cost is legible: he must forever bear the weight of what he's swallowed. Causal lens holds throughout with the origami multiplication leading to vacuum creation leading to swallowing. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the summoner's purpose clarifies around line 5) and some opacity around the exact mechanics of "mapping silence."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—the narrator accepting the role of "new linguist" with Mrs. Chen as next student crystallizes options with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the tutor's disappearance mechanism ("she had never been alive in the way I assumed") strains credibility without sufficient grounding earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's act transforms the garden into a public archive, with visible cost (color-blindness) paid on page. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as sensory details build toward the final communal transformation. The piece teaches its metaphorical logic early (garden as bruise, memory as contagion) and pays it off at closure when strangers hum the freed lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Mara transforms from forger to truth-writer, with blood as literal cost. The seventeen-year arc coheres through recurring sanctuary/thorn/key motifs that reweight at the ending. Slight ding for orientation arriving late (~120 words) though it serves the meditative opening.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught echo mechanics that culminate in Lira completing her mother's unfinished departure—a Decisive Change with clear cost (releasing the trapped echo). The piece teaches its serpentine/spiral logic early and pays it off through the nexus descent and cocoon dissolution. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the closure lands with "ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate."

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Marrow retrieves the pure snow globe and gains "knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light," with visible cost in the glacier closing and passengers dissolving. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases building to closure. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the glacier/diving context.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns layer (nets→moon paths→firefly synchronization→shadow stairs) toward a resonant reconfiguration where she becomes the hidden effort she sought to appreciate. Cost appears in "constant vanishing" and stepping off solid stone, though the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than discovered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the orchard's transformation (apples browning, releasing glass seeds) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—truth accelerating decay. The diamond's curse elegantly reframes from punishment to "perfect memory," and Marisol's decision to make it a permanent broadcast station shows agency with visible consequence. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through radio frequencies and shadow preservation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's song creates "variant allegiances blooming" and the prophet hears his forgotten humanity—a clear before/after with the cost of her continued isolation. The early prophecy setup pays off through her role as memory-keeper rather than destroyer.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the music box's transformation from sealed relic to projective bridge, with clear cost in Posy's years of patient collecting. The accumulative lens holds consistently as density increases through layered sounds until the final "We are still becoming" reweights the entire preservation project. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words with clear who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Mireya transforms destruction into listening, achieving sonic absolution through vibrational matching. The cost is legible in worn key teeth and the engineer's permanent adaptation to "glacier time." Minor orientation delay (who/where/when crystallizes slowly) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where moon-tracking accumulates to trigger the magnetic disruption. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Elian kneels on ice, leaving his compass as offering while villages signal revolution. The "coast that would already be waking different" shows genuine consequence, though the exact mechanism of change could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Mara's investigation layers personal and professional discoveries toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses testimony over silence. The closure lands with visible cost—walking back carrying others' guilt alongside her own trauma. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for slight causality softness in how quickly she connects her father to the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Emil accepts he must still witness the execution but has acted on truth, with visible cost in misappropriating chapel funds. The causal chain from music box repair to evidence leak to journalist is clear. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. Cost is legible in "knowing he still had to stand beside the gurney, but now also beside truth."

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where striking the bell transforms it from waiting for a clapper to waiting for a translator, with visible cost (arrow tip "dulled but satisfied"). The accumulative lens holds as patterns build toward this crystallization. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how the kaleidoscope translates mood into grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building through discovery pattern (hashtag→patch→server farm→crystal→mother) with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where keeper becomes living archive. The transformation has visible cost (employee file flickering, name dimming). Slight deduction for convenience in how easily she accesses the restricted server farm.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal chain from fragment's vision to rescue execution, with clear DC closure (Sira saved, relationship restored). The shard showing two futures effectively raises stakes. Deduction for slightly rushed final beat that cuts off mid-whisper without fully landing the cost, though the rescue's physical toll and relationship reconfiguration are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Mara's transformation into someone who "grips reality loosely enough to feel it breathing," with visible cost in her renunciation of the parasol heirloom. The accumulative structure coheres around the recurring "fold in patience" and builds density through the tea ceremony with elders. However, the temporal leap to "years later" dilutes immediate cost, and the extended coda past Mara's own aging weakens the closure's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and vineyard details layer toward Marcus's recognition that "staying could be the bravest journey." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he reframes the burned letter from "wound" to "window," with 37 years of isolation as the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the walker successfully preserving wisdom's echo through his consecration ritual—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (his permanent role as guardian). The orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for the prophet's departure feeling convenient and the "conjured clearing" manifestation lacking clearer mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the communal witnessing that transforms private archival work into collective healing. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from solitary ritual to shared catharsis with the town's "one lung made of many" exhale providing clear cost and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the pattern of collected sounds building toward revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the crystal beside the dictionary and leaves, transforming the library from repository to living testimony with clear conceptual cost—the end of defined language.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks, with the cassette tape discovery providing meaningful deepening that reweights the prophet's search. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the spiral marking act, though cost could be more viscerally felt beyond the philosophical "one forgotten tomorrow at a time."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's departure transforms the observatory into a photograph, with visible cost (30 years of life collapsed into a single frame). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated images (luminous ache, sound of falling leaf, clock hand) that reweight at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the textural logic holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensory layering (dishwater blood, bleach smell, petrichor) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara understands reunification means "carry both pieces forward." The closure lands with visible cost through Calderon's death and the daughter's drought-breaking tears. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (hospice, Room 914, Mr. Calderon).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with Lyra's sacrifice creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—shadows restored worldwide at personal cost. The piece teaches its pattern early (bent spoons, creased time) and builds through density toward the final image of "love bent into shape by light." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the cost is visible in her traded shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through garden transformation and constellation imagery, landing on Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts fractured certainty as strength. Cost is visible in her kneeling submission and acceptance of errors. Orientation anchors are delayed (character clear, but setting/situation emerges gradually) without serving closure, triggering -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira transforms from isolated star-watcher to communal light-bearer, with clear cost ("pearl dissolve between her fingers, its last weight the exact heft of a sigh released after long crying"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "who" slightly earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the burial ritual and amber pendant placement, with visible cost in "pressing the pattern left by drip of thawing icicles into the soil." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the Elias encounter feels slightly convenient. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara shifts from collecting hopes to releasing them, with visible cost in carrying "nothing visible, yet the shapes...rustled inside her." The accumulative pattern of encounters builds coherently, though the mechanism of how hopes manifest at the nexus arrives somewhat late without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the pollen release, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgetting becomes remembering. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The cost is felt in "the weight of centuries pressing against her chest" and the vine's sacrifice, though the ending's resolution feels slightly too complete for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis through the alchemist's relinquishment of the illustration plate, with visible cost in tearing something precious. The accumulative lens holds as patterns and waiting build toward this crystallized moment. However, the ending cuts off mid-sentence ("With steady fingers she tore the storybook"), leaving the closure technically incomplete even if the gesture is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the timer's reverse-engineering creating a pattern break that releases the trapped hours, culminating in Ansel's Earned Stasis of storing wonder "for later." The closure lands with clear cost—sealing away discovery rather than exploiting it. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving slowly (who/where clarifies gradually through inference rather than anchoring).

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the weaver collecting burden-threads that build toward her own confession—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (blood, cut finger). The bronze grotto's resistance and eventual opening create coherent pressure, though the mystical mechanics occasionally obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's acceptance of "here and gone" - she transforms from trying to contain memory to understanding memory as "both cage and key." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward this reweighting. Minor orientation wobble with "Through crystallized time she saw Emil's gloved hand slip into hers after the funeral" creates temporal confusion but doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when narrator and ghost exchange states, with visible cost ("remain, a fragment collector without pockets"). The accumulative structure coheres through the moon-wheel's year-frames and fragment exchanges, though orientation takes ~150 words to fully anchor who/what/where, slightly dulling early pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the terminal transforms from "departure gates" to "arrival gates" with visible cost in abandoned infrastructure and city desperation. The sextant's journey from Mara to child creates coherent accumulative pressure. The pattern teaches early through "maze of intentions" and pays off with "solvable circuit."

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's release of her dream transforms into the linden tree that "continues to count the slow breath of stars." The cost is palpable: forty years of carrying failure, the bear's destruction, and the dream's transformation into something beyond her control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of erasure/revelation building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases the sundial and commits to monument dismantling. Cost is legible in "felt both lighter and ancient" and the foreclosed path of comfortable myth. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "who" (Mara's identity emerges gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Ari plants the storm-corn seed in the dock's snow, with the shoot's emergence and rope's braiding of light confirming the weavers' continuity. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through rope-reading, fulgurite glass, and seed knowledge. Cost is visible in the confrontation risked and the death of the last tide-weaver, though the resolution feels slightly too neat with the magical plant growth.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the weft thread's revelation and the garden's transformative space. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the traveler realizes she's been writing her own obituary in reverse, with clear cost (seven years of self-imposed absence). The final image of the garden spelling new names for future travelers effectively reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the palace's fall becomes "the first spread of wings," with the prince's acceptance that beauty cannot be caged providing visible cost through the palace's destruction. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the assembly sequence, culminating in the ribbon's transformative release. Causality tracks cleanly from hypothesis through assembly to release, though the late introduction of the Genesis Finch legend slightly weakens early orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's promise to bring saplings next year, showing progression from carrying shame to cultivating growth. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from sand-grafting through memory to future commitment. Cost is visible in the "burned side of her own forearm" and the weight of annual pilgrimage, though the final transformation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with four fountain visits building to memory release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - memories dissolve, geese resume flight, silence transforms from absence to acceptance.

Orientation anchors effectively establish the nebula garden setting and Kael's role within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her name in forget-me-nots and laughs—a moment that reweights her role from observer to participant in the cycle of grief. The accumulative structure builds through ribbon, butterflies, and spiral patterns that converge meaningfully, with visible cost in the "tiny white seedlings" breaking through tiles and families weeping "without knowing why."

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when replacing the pendulum bob transforms the clock from debt-measure to forgiveness-teacher, with visible cost in the narrator's burning arms and the village's changed relationship to time. The accumulative lens holds as inscriptions, tidal erosion, and mechanical precision layer toward the final image of the rake handle ticking "for-give, for-give."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as repeating discoveries build toward Mercy becoming the next keeper. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she accepts her role, though the cost could be more visceral. Strong causal chain from coin→tapestry→map→cellar, but some transitions feel mechanically convenient ("exactly the diameter of the sovereign").

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dissolution that lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the cartographer becomes the constraint enabling future innovation, with visible cost in her complete transformation. The piece teaches its lyric logic early through frost flowers and shadow-tracking. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the spire-lake-cartographer relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens builds through dust-teaching-story layers to a resonant reconfiguration where inspectors become unwilling students of banned narratives. The closure lands with visible cost (Mila doesn't flee, accepts consequences) and conceptual repricing as the city itself begins remembering stories through mist and chord.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's art installation serving as both literal and metaphorical closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the act of scattering powder transforms grief into artistic expression with clear emotional cost. The pattern of fragmentation (porcelain, stories, memory) accumulates toward the final image of orbiting spirals that "mark the places where truth and fiction become indistinguishable." Minor orientation delays (gallery location, time of day) slightly weaken early grounding but don't compromise the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sedimentary layers of denial literally and metaphorically build toward Caldera's counter-narrative intervention. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she surfaces to speak publicly, shifting from hidden archivist to visible truth-teller with the crowd's "hesitation" marking changed stakes. Cost appears in her isolation and the physical labor of truth-preservation, though the immediate price of her public stance remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's silence becomes the city's root tone, with visible cost (rosette crumbles, voice sacrificed). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight the dominant stake of transforming hatred through subtraction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Ministry officers leaving "disarmed, pockets mysteriously full of plum-colored seeds" shows transformation spreading beyond Marisol's initial act. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers toward this crystallized image where cost is felt in "every scar carries the latitude of future sweetness." Who/where/when anchored early through "rusted greenhouse" and "twin moons rose."

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the open gate and cryptic matchbox promise "wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest," reweighting the truthfulness constraint. The causal chain from riddle to ascent to lie to lightning strike coheres. Slight dock for the boy's unexplained disappearance and the queen bee's agency remaining opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through displaced objects, breathing houses, and violet perfume building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mireille establishes a covenant with the sentient house. The closure lands with visible cost—the orris shard embedded as payment—and the final image of streetlights surrendering dreams while she wonders about a city asking to be held reweights the opening's daydreaming streetlights beautifully. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the garden transforms from "museum of certainties" to living ambiguity with clear cost (dissolution of certainties). The ampoule's breaking at the keystone arch causes cascading revelations that reconfigure the entire underwater city. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (underwater garden, statue POV). Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (dice landing on edge, step −1) that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara recognizes the missed opportunity as "a door never seen" and chooses dissolution over stepping through, with cost visible in the staircase forgetting her. The orientation anchors (infinite staircase, Elara climbing) establish by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the greenhouse transforms into "a lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood," with visible cost in Mira's seventeen-hour collapse. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern teaching (lost languages in objects, kindness as contagion). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the waterfall/grotto imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where art becomes "placement—of memory into muscle." The cost lands visibly as artisans risk return and Aurelia stakes her museum's future, though the Council's retreat slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the clockmaker escapes fate but loses his singular gift—a clear before/after with felt cost. The causal chain from reversed clocks to lighthouse mechanism to final escape is coherent. The ending reweights his entire identity from "counter clockwise clock maker" to someone who forges clocks "that told no time at all."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through recurring images (mirrors, clasp, luminance) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator gives the clasp to their fear-self and accepts the "lingering luminance" as their own. Cost is visible in the dissolution of the funhouse and the transformation from external advisor to "unfrightened heart." The pattern teaches itself early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "the obstacle become instrument, the silence become groove" crystallizes with visible cost (the Doldrum Wall's resistance overcome through collective effort). The accumulative structure coheres as sonic layers build toward breakthrough. Slight dock for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the revelation that the gate protects against voluntary exile reweights all prior material, with clear cost in the "terrible chart" that will guide others away. The accumulative pattern of whistle sequences, tremor matching, and spiral grooves coheres perfectly. Orientation anchors (cartographer, Chelon, desert watchers) land within the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal drive with Elara retrieving the letter and escaping with it. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she walks toward a future where "truth, though slower, traveled farther than noble lies" with visible cost to her family's legacy. The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains causality throughout, though the watchman's arrival feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration - Mara's ritual transforms the pavilion into a repository of memory with visible cost (the lightened inkwell, walking away without looking back).

The closure lands with "each step echoing like a newly catalogued truth," though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the maker transforms grief into living lanterns that will "glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye," with visible cost in the moonstone crumbling and her backward exit erasing traces. The paradoxical descent-while-ascending stair that "erased a day of sorrow from her face and added a line of luminous torment to her eyes" establishes pattern early and pays off through the ritual's transformative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's calculated fall creating a .003-degree shift that saves a village—clear cost paid on-page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments of potential pool and accumulate toward this final crystallization. Minor orientation debt: the floating observatory's initial relationship to the crater takes time to clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Mara discovers belonging isn't lost but waiting on a different frequency - this reweights the entire pursuit with visible cost (her journey, her losses). The accumulative structure builds through reveals about the chip, the press, and the frequency concept. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay and some convenience in the pilgrim having exactly what she needs, but causality holds and cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's casting of the shell rosary and acceptance of balanced emptiness forecloses her path of guilt-accumulation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors and the dolphin arrival that reweights navigation possibilities. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "the broken navigator is simply the one who keeps navigating" with visible cost (gashed drysuit, abandoned charts). Orientation anchors solidly by line 2. The pattern of utility pole navigation deepens from desperate substitute to legitimate wayfinding method.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the seeker transforms from amnesia to responsibility, with visible cost paid through absorbing others' pain in the lake. The time-loop structure with the baseball creates elegant causality. The lens holds consistently as accumulative/textural with causal support. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to establish the post-procedure context.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where two beings merge into one guardian, with visible cost ("the last tear either of us would cry alone").

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene, clean orientation, and an accumulative drive that lands in a conceptual repricing: decay as twin timelines, “No villains, only vectors.” Closure feels earned through repeated micro-choices and the spectrometer result; the cost is quiet (refusal of drama, acceptance of limits). Slight softness of overt cost keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: images and actions compound until the renunciation (crushing the ledger, turning back) reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure lands with cost—the map destroyed, the pursuit abandoned. One clean tightening at the ash circle and dawn wait precedes the decisive shift. The bus and new studio pay off the lens without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-beat densifies the pattern toward a Conceptual Repricing—the world isn’t silent but translated. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and set-ups pay off (scanner, forks, conservatory, battery). Closure lands on the page with cost (battery dies; she chooses to leave the image rather than chase a fix), and options are reweighted. The final image crystallizes a before/after without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is tight: package → descent → discovery → repair attempt → insufficiency → memory-fire amplification → keeper acceptance. Closure lands with cost (he stays as lighthouse keeper; the inland parlor is abandoned). The lens holds as Hybrid with causal dominance at the end; no orientation debt. Magical beats stay consistent with the story’s established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent and escalates via the bell’s chime, tightened checkpoints, flour scarcity, and Lila’s death; tactics adapt causally. However, the piece ends mid‑sentence (“Together they read the”), so no on‑page closure unit lands; the before/after cannot be charged with cost at the end. Without the final cadence, the drive lens can’t crystallize into RR/CR. This truncation materially undercuts structural satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: breath-linked perception leads to projection glow → condensation door → orchard of withheld kindness → return with redistributed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (storage as posture) with on-page cost (giving the bead, confronting withheld gifts). Orientation is crisp from the first line, and set-ups (camera, breath, wisteria, tear) pay off. The causal chain is lyrical yet legible at each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds from the garden’s first response to the fragment through the mirror to the crush, with a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end (seed/letting go). Orientation is clear early and the pattern is taught and honored. The decisive act (crushing) occurs on‑page and yields a coherent after-state that reweights stakes. Cost is legible: surrender of continuity/identity for a different relation to memory.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: decode → locate → distract/impede → wall falls → access vault → seeds scattered → banner arrow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (sirens nearing, chain still on, no time to secure safety). The piano‑cipher setup pays off without feeling convenient. Orientation is crisp from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent accumulative/causal lens that tightens through the forge sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she sacrifices the preserved absence and redefines her work’s aim; the cost is on the page. Setups (device, absences, aurora/forge) pay off without stray threads. The final image reweights the premise while honoring prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and causal turns holds: flower code → client’s plea → starlight as price → ring inscription reveal → reinterpretation choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (refusal to thin the fabric further) and a conceptually tightened world rule (memory theft/restoration ethics). Orientation is clean by ~120 words; the twist is logically prepped by prior thefts. The only softness is the on‑page cost, which reads more ethical than materially consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative design coheres cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: she decides to leave the dome, reweighting her flight into stewardship. Orientation is immediate and steady; each step (fuel → fire → construction → placement) links causally.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: clue on the cast leads to the shell, the shell reframes tactics, guards arrive, projection outmaneuvers them, and the plan to leak lands as closure. The lens reads Causal to Charged Poise; the decisive internal commitment changes options with on‑page risk. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the projector/stars payoff is prepped by environment. Cost is legible in the public self‑exposure and immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each “summarized silence” thickens pressure, leading to the fort’s transposition into the booklet and the star’s extinguishing. Closure lands with cost—names carried off, the world flattened, the oracle confined to the paper fort—constituting a Conceptual Repricing with tangible loss. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the pattern is taught early and paid off. The “last star waiting for her signature” is a crisp causal hinge within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds cleanly; the loop mechanism is taught early and governs timing and choices. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: repetition becomes the crucible for thought rather than the prison. Cost is conceptual—accepting endless cycles—and legible in the charged final return to maintenance. Minor exposition about the Program borders on told rationale but does not break causality or lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: cryptic ticket → search → overheard confession → retrieval of lens → public screening → social thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she withholds exposure, stages an image‑based apology, and limits the story to the walls with visible cost (relinquishing confrontation/punishment). Orientation is strong from the first line; lens holds consistently. The single turn is sufficient and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds: ritual → hidden grove → apple → glove → reframed partnership. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with a clear before/after in Elara’s stance. Orientation is clean from the outset; cause flows as patterned recognition rather than plot twists. The cost is implied but legible in the final acceptance of servant‑status and the house‑like garden image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: lever → projections → moth‑bat interference → realization → renunciatory return to stasis. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost: she foregoes altering the past and accepts the constraint of her mechanical lungs. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no causality breaks. The conceptual reweighting is felt through concrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural structure holds: images in the program cue steps (staircase → door → case) toward a closure that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and set-ups (program, ghost’s silence, flood) pay off. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—embracing the between-spaces and playing the unsung—but the on‑page cost is softer than ideal. Still, the because/therefore chain reads clean within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: instruments repeat “heavier,” the aurora intensifies, the root pierces, and the smudging/expulsion completes a decisive change. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence (who/where/when) and the speculative rule-set is learned through use. Closure lands on-page with cost (expulsion, environment stilled, the bundle buried). No causality breaks; each beat coheres toward the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative pressure coheres: confession → code on radio → key fits → ghosts demand weighing → burns and loss of the wheel. Closure lands on the page with cost and a reweighted premise (truth’s literal mass taken into the narrator). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern of coded beads pays off. No causality breaks; each move is a “therefore,” not “and then.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: river → library → river, with the swan and silence as causal links. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: acceptance that forgetting may be mercy and a future decision to remain stone-bound when the swan dissolves. Cost is conceptual but legible (the loss of vocation/self when the map dies). The final sentence fragment mars cadence but does not erase the closure achieved a line earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: eclipse clock, ritual objects, and the linking note build to totality, then resolve into a charged after‑image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world looks the same yet is “irreversibly linked,” with a felt cost in what the children carry and in the curl’s darkening. Constraints (alignment requirement, eclipse timing) shape tactics and the final image. No causal gaps or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: diaries → phrase → pattern (“displaced axis”) → final act that reconfigures space. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the mosaic steps are legible. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: she transfers the dragons and becomes the axis, altering the library and her status. Setups (tapestry, loose stone, axis) pay off in the decisive ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: repeated “open secret” and light/darkroom mechanics accrue toward the departure. Causality is intact—fortune written, film exposed, cookie planted, skiff untied—and the closure lands on page with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when on a lighthouse night). The final image reconfigures options and meaning without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (layered loops) and held through the reversal (infinite reverse) to on‑page closure: the possession passes because questions are resolved. Because/therefore linkages are elegant and legible (layers → hum of assumption → possession advances → reverse collapses the texture). The cost is present in the body and in forfeiting the built sound‑rope. Slight ding for the truncated final sentence, though closure already landed one beat earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Pattern is taught early (mapping memories with the nautilus on the spire) and accrues toward an on‑page closure where the ache dissolves and the horizon imprints her eyelids. The clock structures escalation, and each memory advances the design toward conducting. The final image (shell to sand; horizon folded into a line) completes a resonant reconfiguration with cost (exhaustion, loss of tool). Orientation is clean from the opening; the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: fractures, forks, and echoes escalate toward the decisive smash and the doorway image. Closure lands with conceptual repricing and visible cost (loss of the tablet’s power, dissolution of elder self, reconfigured identity). Orientation is taught early (Kael/viaduct/tablet) and remains legible through the surreal turns. Setups (procedural retracing, fractures, periodically eternal) pay off cleanly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile setup → repair → backward playback → drum‑making → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief fully arrives and is accepted, with the needle kept as a priced token. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is coherent and object‑driven. The cost is on the page—she trades numbness for raw pain and a permanent reminder around her neck.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: future‑dated message → tail in the shadows → lateral detour and secret shaft → discovery of the rogue zone → counter‑move via pigeons → charged poise ending. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she chooses solitude and a networked resistance with an on‑page cost. The maintenance shaft and lichen mapping could feel conveniently available, but they’re motivated by her routine and the setting’s secret history. Orientation is clean early and the lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure intensifies via UV activation, release of “Maybe tomorrow,” orchid resonance, and the offering that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—he foregoes tomorrow’s trade and accepts a new vocation of grief. Orientation is immediate (greenhouse, olfactory collapse, fungi) and sustained. The final image reframes prior beats without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the rope and grotto pattern the decision until the beings gather at the mouth and prompt closure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the narrator refuses transcendence and commits to walking, with the cost legible (forgoing “weightless eternity” under a dying world). Orientation is clean from the start. The scene coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each move—seed in bowl, unresolved notes, wire-bridge resonator—intensifies the premise and narrows options toward the charged dawn image. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with a felt price. Setups (shipwrecks, bell shard, bowl) pay off causally. The final leaf and humming bowl reweight all prior beats with cost and promise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the scent layers intensify until a resonant reconfiguration occurs. Closure is on‑page and costly—she relinquishes her armor and accepts pain as proof of reachability; the “vial cracked” and dusk sealing the grotto give tangible price. Spatial and temporal anchors are clean from the outset; no orientation debt. Setups (petal, static, resin) pay off in the final image with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative drive coheres: music → library → envelope → wharf → NGO → receipt → locket handoff → ledger entry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing the locket; formalizing the donation), and the “cycle” concept reframes prior acts. Coincidence (Beto’s nephew) complicates rather than resolves and is integrated into the cycle ledger motif. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the repeated dawn walks and widening circle culminate in a conceptual repricing—“the artist” is the collective act of looking together. Closure lands on the page with cost: the tag dissolves, leaves a scar, and Lira sets down solitary tools for communal commitment. Causality is clean and patterned, with setups (arbor, dawn, rumor) paying off in the discovery and communal illumination. The final reconfiguration forecloses the old path of solitude and recodes the orchard as a social vow.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens: cadence → reversed water → canal fork → aviary → payment → doorway → recovered syllable → restored timeline. Closure lands on the page with cost (future minutes surrendered) and reconfigures her options. Orientation is crisp from the first line, and the pattern of rules is taught and kept. No teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: mosaic → astrolabe → projection → seedlings → restoration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: music returns, options reweight, and the protagonist accepts a limit rather than certainty. Causal links are clean within the dream-logic; set-ups (chipped mosaic, dripping stalactite, glass eyes) pay off. The mechanisms succeed on first tries, muting the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fragments accrue into a charged reveal where the girl says “I see you,” a clean on‑page RR. Orientation is crisp early (library, outage, crawlspace), and the pattern is taught and paid off. The cost is emotional rather than logistical, but it lands in the final beat with a before/after. No extraneous detours or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cause chains are tight: storm → anomalous veins → sample/glass intensification → power loss → physical linking → surrender and transformation, followed by an aftermath shard that consolidates consequences. The lens reads Accumulative with causal steps, culminating in an on‑page Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible in the rooting/body change and in the altered nursery. The mosaic coda is clean and deepens the closure rather than resetting it.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition → encounter → charged making → exchange → repriced self. Orientation is immediate (causeway, tide, monastery), and each beat causally seeds the next (brooch warming → spirals → guide/mandate to paint → vial exchange). Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: insomnia reframed and counter‑pointed by the first deep sleep. The cost is felt more as history’s ache and traded memory than as a sharp on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative drive holds cleanly to a charged closure: the gift transfer with irreversible cost, sealing the exit. Orientation is swift and legible; causal steps (pearl → memory symphony → transfer → attempted return → cave’s cadence forbids) track. The price is on the page (her erosion into mineral song; his permanent scar and obligation). The vanishing entrance charges the before/after with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear because/therefore chain: exile returns; needs records; therefore seeks trumpet parts; therefore must gain entry; therefore must persuade mouthpiece‑keeper; therefore the note. The closure lands on the page with a decisive act that reconfigures the city’s sonic landscape. Cost is legible in the woman’s surrender and the narrator’s risk of public breath after erasure. The causal spine is tight despite lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: object leads to tunnel, to fortress, to confessional action, to reconfigured canvas. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: “began punching his own chest” and the tunnel sealing after the sunrise-hued paint replaces the punch. Stakes narrow coherently as options transform from mapping escape to mapping arrival. Orientation is strong from the outset, and no causal stitch is left unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: starlight → memory surge → elected listening → pattern alignment → transcription → whales’ answer → relinquishment. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (tower, coast, task, night frame). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with explicit cost: “confirming nothing she could publish yet everything she now trusted,” and placing the tile into a tide pool to erase data. The present-tense clock (till dawn) and midnight turn tighten cadence without mechanical plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: storm → fragment compulsion → encounter with mutineers → shards unite → door → Vey’s crossing. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing (choosing “proceed” over memory), and the price is legible. The lens reads Hybrid leaning causal, held consistently. No orientation debt; the single-scene arc stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: waiting → Rurik arrives → ink use consumes a memory → he rewrites the document → price and aftermath. Closure lands on the page with visible cost and a mailed document that reconfigures options. Orientation is immediate and stable. Minor convenience in Rurik’s swift compliance is justified by the ink’s rules and her preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: quiet setup → lamp/hum → involuntary dictation → glider ignition → bonsai transformation. Closure lands on the page with cost (sheet burned, “heart heavier by one truth”) and a coherent before/after. Orientation is established early (who/where/when) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; the reel discovery and “press” realization provide a decisive deepening toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisply set within the opening lines; the port/tide clock coheres the window. Cost appears on-page in the turn from poison/erasure to self-lamination and departure toward the harbor mouth. The beats link via therefore-consequence within an accumulative cadence rather than and-then drift.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative structure escalates cleanly through the sequence of notes—voices resurrect, shell cracks, compass appears, silence spiral—culminating in a reweighted premise. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: he abandons proof for a living compass and porous truth. Costs are on‑page (foregoing evidence, bodily tug, accepting ambiguity) and the pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear from the outset and the magical causality remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑POV, clean causality: graffiti → midnight assembly → overnight reorg → inspectors recoil → charged poise ending. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: privatization is postponed and meaning reweighted; the price—ongoing threat—remains on the page. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure with textural build) and holds. The only slight softness is that the “map” need is absorbed into tactics rather than progressing as a concrete subplot.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the two‑timer setup, the wind’s arrival, the synchronized opening/closing, and the final crimson flush tighten coherently. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she captures “the last possible second,” foreclosing further action with felt cost (extinction, contract’s end). The causal chain from reagent to wind to folding reads clean and motivated. The final clipped phrase “no margin” is a hairline stumble but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: damaged wing → deeper vein/battery issue → patch → feedback terror → retraining via water → launch. Orientation is precise from the first lines, and the internal logic of the repair world holds. Closure lands decisively with the drone’s reconfigured behavior and departure under the live clock. The on‑page cost is primarily time/risk rather than a sacrificed option, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Coherent causal chain: radio “convergence” → observation of condensation spiral → language-key test → descent → mapping/transmission → renunciation. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: she chooses myth over coordinates, with on-page cost and a reweighted world-picture. Orientation is established early and the magic rule is taught by action (phrase opens ice) before relying on it at the climax. No stray setups go unpaid; the final spiral/frost image pays back the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: ritual → response → partial rebuild → resistant north ward → personal offering → reconfiguration. The closure lands on‑page with felt cost (he becomes the tenth bell), and the lens (accumulative/textural with causal turns) holds. Orientation is immediate and stable. Setups pay off (archway keystone, footsteps/cobblestones, the fork’s evolving state).

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clean causal chain: hush dampens the call → discovery of organ → conversion of scent to signal → amplified broadcast → rescue reply and arrival. Orientation is swift and legible; single-scene pressure tightens logically. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the temple shifts from suppressor to amplifier, and Mira pays a visible price (vial, near-asphyxia). The persistent constraint (shrinking air) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each step requires narrative fuel, leading to the mirror/pipe trial and the charged emergence. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the prison/reef world gives way to the meadow and the path of light after he forgives but refuses to become silence. The rule “the path exists only while he speaks” is a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of the prior world and identity (“Cry‑Wolf”) for a new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Strong causal chain: bead → appearances → altar crisis → escape through glass → ice ritual that erases the tumor’s “blueprint.” Closure lands on the page with cost (her dissolution, bead lost, orchard fails to bloom). The drive lens reads Causal with a lyric surface, held through the end. No orientation debt; the rule‑set (bead/greenhouse/masters) is consistent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual acts compound until the sea returns. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (blood, dissolution of the plate, loom submerging). The before/after is legible and irreversible. Minor softness in causal resistance keeps it just shy of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: discovery → alignment rituals → reliquary → root‑road → dawn activation → rebuilt chapel. Closure is on‑page and costly (decisive rebuild plus the life choice to remain). Orientation is clean from the first lines; set‑ups pay off (sundial base, hymn, mirrors, rib as gnomon).

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single, coherent scene with a live clock and visible tightening when the drone arrives early. The causal chain holds: deadline pressure forces a decisive selection between two letters. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with felt cost (remaining unread, erasing the chalk map). Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: clandestine listening → encoded embroidery → public projection → pistol → reorientation via “adjacent possibilities” → coup averts. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when), and the bell at three tightens the clock. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (risk of death, cultural erasure confronted) and a visible turn (pistol lowered). Slight softness in paid-on-page loss keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual steps (shard → mirror → water corridor) causally open the seam. Closure lands on-page: “I’m sorry” seeds through time, with the cost marked by the healed cut and emptied pockets. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/drive). The final image reconfigures options without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding the cast deepens stakes from date to village to coral-spiral, culminating in a reweighted final image. Orientation is established early (field hospital atrium, twilight, anesthetic) and serves the closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the discharge line and star reprice guilt into sediment with cost (endurance, confession). The persistent constraint—the smudging ink and approaching dark—shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each move densifies pressure (failed sunbeams → fragment → Lattice → living wall → costly painting). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mural’s private dawn reframes “lost” into “developed,” with on‑page price. Orientation is clean from the first line; set‑ups (fog, fresco, Lattice, living wall) all pay off. The shard’s dissolution provides a clear before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: failed method → coin bargain → nested awakenings → final charged poise/CR. Closure lands with a conceptual price: she renounces completion as the definition of restoration. The garden/echo mechanics stay consistent and culminate in the last image. Orientation is clear from the opening and supports the ending without explanatory backfill.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: seed placement → coded confirmations → Voss intrusion + satellite clock → pollen distraction → warp‑assisted slip. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: by sunrise the planted word “Resist” reweights the world’s tax logic with social cost and personal risk. Persistent constraints (surveillance, taxable thoughts, ticking satellite pass) shape tactics. The on‑page cost is more conceptual than bodily, but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: wind → memory/dew → instruction → activation → glow → sleep/armistice sealed. Closure lands on the page with cost: he leaves “centuries of longing” in the shell and finally sleeps, while the armistice propagates. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). Causal threads are lyric but coherent, with the postcard’s postscript decisively triggering the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the guttering bulbs create a live clock, each payment escalates, and the chandelier’s rule cleanly governs tactics and cost. Closure lands on‑page with undeniable price when Lira sacrifices her self‑memory. Setups (tube, chandelier, museum) pay off causally without late rule changes. Orientation is immediate and sustained despite lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural pressure builds cleanly through the sequence of promises to the on‑page closure where she completes the symphony. The missing final section as “negative space” is a strong causal reveal that reweights options. Cost is legible: the ink well shatters and her voice transforms, foreclosing the “document only” path. Orientation is clear early and the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: measurement → spectro finding (3.7 mm) → confrontation → collaborative recalibration → on‑time installation → public test. The closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the gate quivers between open and shut, with both factions witnessing the controlled breath. Cost is legible (political risk, altered specs, fragile alliance). The final sentence is truncated, a minor textual seam that slightly blurs the last beat but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: from entry/hiding to alliance, dissemination of melodies, raid, and charged absence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she’s gone; the etched lullaby and children’s rope‑song reprice identity at real cost. Orientation is clean early; pattern taught and paid off. Slightly soft causal pin at the escape (off‑stage), but the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: terrace drift → table-grain decoding → coordinates → threshold step → between‑place realization. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The causal thread is soft but coherent—the spiral notches and terrace’s westward drift motivate the step into the maze. Cost is legible as a relinquishment of the prior story in favor of the “necessary distance.”

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries accrete (feather → echo → chalk constellations → exhale ritual) to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Cost is on the page via renunciation (no data, atlas page torn) under a live time constraint; the final promise reweights the premise. Orientation is clean from the start, and set‑ups (moon‑pipes, thermocline power, feather) pay off. The closure image (paper bird igniting as last burnt feather) lands with conceptual price and earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: seeds → glass fragments → personal cost → planting/farewell. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: her sacrifice is reaffirmed by the flood of saved emotions, with dawn and fading memory tightening the frame. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and maintained through to the beach exit. Causal seams are smooth for this lyric mode; no late rule changes undermine the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: meticulously seeded cues converge on the boy’s “lucky” win, then reprice meaning with the second bishop. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR—design and chance are reweighted, with Cass choosing anonymity and relinquishment. The because/therefore chain is intact even while lyrical. The truncated final line slightly blurs cadence at the end, nicking the otherwise clean landing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from first step to the final stanza as dust dwindles and dawn approaches. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes the forbidden memory—paid for by exile, risk, and sacrificing the moonstone’s last grain. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the sunrise clock provides tightening. No causal breaks; the fountain/dust/sunrise cadence coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual deepens from waiting to reading rings to the sacrificial throw. Orientation is crisp by the first sentences (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: she gives up the prism, which dissolves to heal the town’s windows, completing the “ledger.” The because/therefore chain is lyric but legible, though not overtly causal in a traditional plot sense.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative drive tightens cleanly from quiet ascent to ritual action to a reconfigured stance. The closure lands on‑page: he leaves the box open, spends the ash into a communal signal, and accepts a costly commission. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no lens ambiguity. Costs are explicit and carried forward (“innocence… is never returned”).

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure coheres in a single accumulative scene: patterns → balloon descent → equation/blood → release → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the shells’ sentence recasts the premise and she resets the gauge to “unknown,” accepting uncertainty as price. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no causality breaks. The cost is subtle but legible: she relinquishes certainty while seeding hope into a collective beyond control.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (diaries → negative → hatch → tunnel) tighten toward a charged transformation. Closure lands on‑page with cost—Mira becomes the echo/corridor, reconfiguring premise and options. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when after climate shifts) and the camera‑building logic is paid off. The coda with the rescue team cleanly seals the loop without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: song → resistance (infinite failures) → self‑alteration (dance/become mirror) → new mission. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the terrace’s rules (acoustics/prisms) stay consistent. Closure lands on‑page with cost as the bell toll ends the hush and the heartbeat becomes shared. A slight expositional tilt in the penultimate reflections softens causal bite but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: a ritual gathering that intensifies toward a collective signing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—accepting imperfect peace as the costed path forward—on the page with consequences implied in enforcement. Orientation is solid early; pattern is taught and sustained. Minor abstraction doesn’t harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive coheres: map → nest → winding → apparition → dissolution → egg as “fossil of sound.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with legible cost (a valley killed to house an echo, mines persist). Because/therefore links are clear within the lyric logic; no soft reset. A small textual fragment mid‑late (“He’d come to release them and found they’d released”) wobbles polish but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: gather echoes → weave/untangle to unlock → release memories → city wakes → she refuses departure. Closure lands on the page with cost (refusal of the weaver’s cloak; blooded footprints; lingering “alarming serenity”). The drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, held consistently to an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing end. Orientation is clear early and the on‑page countdown (“by dawn”) coheres the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: lighting the stick → backward speech → puppet retelling → burn pain → forward commitment reads as a clean tightening to a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when and why he’s here). Cost is legible on-page (pain, lost patronage, chosen ambiguity) and closure is enacted by the manifesto and ash-writing. A minor reliance on mythic mechanics (stick reversal) remains consistent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ascent → construction → visitation → lift → descent, ending in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page with cost (she surrenders the wing/memorial and accepts transience). A small logic slip—“needed [the monarch’s] singular wing” vs. using a moth wing that is then called the butterfly’s “twin”—introduces mild species confusion that slightly nicks causal clarity. Orientation is otherwise crisp from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the card dissolves; the keeper becomes carrier—while the environment charges the final image. Orientation is clean from the first line, and set‑ups (rope, card, aurora) pay off. The final cadence reweights the premise without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the storm’s approach, wafer’s melt, lens’s rupture, and consent to be “walked” tighten coherently. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the directive redefines continuity and she yields identity to enact it. Orientation is taught early (bunker, storm, seal) and pays off at the end. Persistent constraint (storm timing, architecture, lens) shapes tactics through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: drawing the schematics → lattice reveal → door opens → covenant scene → vow and disappearance. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal anchors, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis that reconfigures his role and options. The cost is on‑page (refusal to teach kings, life spent guarding the unknown). Orientation is firm by ~120 words and supports the ending’s charged return with the herald.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the sanctuary’s rules and the music box pattern escalate to the shadow-Lira turn and resolve in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise final image. Closure lands on the page with cost (music box broken beyond song; Lira metabolizes her own anger; she leaves the tool). Orientation is clear from the outset and remains stable despite the surrealism. Because/therefore linkages are implicit but coherent across image sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: gather tools → assemble device → hum → vision → refusal → scatter shards. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he abandons capture, changing his practice and paying a conceptual price. Causality holds under the textural lens without contrivance. Minor ding for the final fragment, which mars the last cadence without breaking the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: present-tense ritual beats accrue into a resonant reconfiguration where apology becomes sustenance, and the orchard heals at tangible cost. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/CR: she refuses amended contracts, binds wound with ribbon, and the final fragrance reweights the social covenant. Orientation is clean from the first line; cause-effect across items (gear, pollen, ribbon) is coherent. The “years later” epilogue enhances rather than disperses the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain: note → bathroom inquiry → descent → shell temptation → Quell’s warning → refusal and purge → departure. The closure unit (Earned Stasis/CR) lands when she declines to carve and burns the memories, reconfiguring inheritance. However, the very last sentence is cut mid‑action (“to spit out”), marring the cadence and modestly dulling the final hinge. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure with causal moves), held to the end despite the fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: diary-guided descent → rescue via seeds → cipher requiring an unprecedented word → negotiated time-cost → theft of absences → release. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: she alters what “rescue” means by planting absences in the world, accepting an ongoing mission at cost. The year transfer provides concrete price, though its immediate repayment softens the bite. Orientation is strong and the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: the piece teaches its pattern early and closes with a Conceptual Repricing—“the garden” as a moment—with felt cost. Orientation is clear from the opening (who/where/what) and stays coherent. Setups (swatch, ship, chimera’s rules) pay off in the final stepping‑stone image. Cost is on the page (childhood shedding, dissolving identities) and inflects the option-space at EXIT.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal links: the seal placement triggers the mechanism, the rope reconfiguration culminates in the reweighted seal and time’s shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the tower’s purpose is revealed, the treaty’s logic reframed, the door fades, and time resumes differently. Cost reads as conceptual and custodial, not visceral, but it’s on‑page (her palm authorizes the return; remembrance is bounded to avoid weaponization). Orientation is clean early; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with crisp causal linkages: augury → timing the hush → Warden test → dome fracture completion. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the circle closes, beings fold inward, and the stone releases silent meaning. Cost is legible in the cracked relic and the relinquishing of stored voices. Orientation is clean from the start; no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: missing shard → retrocog vision of child → desert retrieval under silence → return → assembly → ignition. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she becomes the prism; voices and rose light reprice coincidence). The accumulative lyric pattern holds without orientation debt. Stakes are resolved through her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: measurements → tribute → map/spiral → verdict/signature → release. Closure lands on the page with cost: her signature functions as verdict, the forecourt hovers awaiting it, then opens to melt and scatter memories. Orientation is established early and remains legible. The causal connection between her verdict and the release is implicit but clear enough through the “waiting for her verdict” line.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: hush → code → staircase → sphere → mosaic of stars. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): chain of hopelessness “snaps,” the rag is ash, and the night is reweighted by invented stars, with a felt cost of surrendering the old tool/state. Orientation is clean from the outset; the “ascend”/“Catch” notes provide crisp, legible turns. Because/therefore linkages are lyrical but coherent, and the final descent toward the child fixes the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pattern of noticing → invitation → offering → acceptance culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (chronicler, grotto, tide) and the closure lands on-page with cost (charged sharing of the cicada, dawn’s threshold). The “memory-forward” foresight elegantly seals the cadence without mechanical wrap-up. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is immediate (who/when/where in the first line), and the accumulative lens holds through closure. The final beat lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she refuses to collect the ultimate silence, releases what she hoarded, and returns altered, with a cost on the page (lost memory, surrendered doll). Causality is coherent and sequential despite the lyric mode. The live hour clock tightens pacing and keeps turns legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: constraints (hexagons, vial phases, dB limit) pattern the scene toward a charged confession. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: fear spoken, the terrace steadies, crystals “seal” a cost; Nilo returns to earned stasis with altered charge. Orientation is clear early and the build is coherent. The persistent constraints shape both tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    A coherent causal chain runs from wall to torch to murals to door to spiral to crown to throne. Orientation is clear early and the drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal with an accumulative lyric texture. Closure lands on the page as a role-shift (bridge, not monarch), though cost remains conceptual more than felt. The sequence lacks a complicating turn beyond the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a coherent accumulative drive toward the ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he crosses and leaves her with a reweighted “breath” while she remains in chosen exile. The doorknocker ring and scorched circle pay off set‑ups, and the cost (remaining, practicing suffocation) is on‑page. Minor neatness in the final aphorism slightly softens the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean single‑scene progression from page to drip line to root‑cave to ocean; because/therefore linkages hold. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: bolt shears to diamond, then renunciation via the throw calms the sea. Cost is on the page (blood, lost bolt/diamond, refusal of unpaid labor). The “tonight when concepts become physical” clock is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight: discovery of the crank via standing waves → activation → confession → public proclamation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as images and objects accrue to a charged final act with cost (blood, snapped handle, identity shift). Orientation is clear from the opening sentence. Closure lands on the page with consequences extending into the city (statues reflowered, door left open).

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring “Reality shifted” marks escalations toward a clear CR/RR closure (“the greenhouse was not a place but a question”). Causal beats link cleanly (program → soil → mercury roots → living script → seed), with cost legible in the reckoning of deserters’ names. The final move to plant is nearly complete but marred by an incomplete last sentence, softening the cadence. Still, the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → reading dust → database act → placement in Marcus’s folder → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: archives reframed as futures via a concrete, risky cataloging choice; the cost is emotional exposure and accountability. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and causality is intact; coincidence is acknowledged without abused certainty (“Unknown, but breathing”). The ending’s snow/kindness image coheres with the drive rather than explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp by the first lines (who/where/when anchored), and causality holds: drones reappear → sprint → booth activation → broadcast → confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the city’s soundscape is reweighted with a cost on the page. The “because/therefore” chain stays intact without convenience, and the final hesitation by officers pays off the build. No loose props or rule slips.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure coheres as sound, space, and refracted glass tighten toward the erasure note. Closure lands on the page with cost via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): he averts the naming at the price of ongoing vigilance. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught early. Setups (atrium echoing, prophecy encoded in intervals) pay off causally in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: beats accrue via leaf‑syllables, monuments, and a keyleaf that completes twelve, leading to on‑page DC (naming) and visible effect (rain, descent). Orientation is clean from the first sentence; causality is consistent. Cost is modest but present in the ticking clock (tree rising, wind) and her physical risk aloft. The reveal line borders on mechanical (“The forgotten thing…”) but the sequence earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: greenhouse gust → cellar seam → waterfall pool → aligned artifacts → renunciation → epilogue confirmations. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he chooses uncertainty, leaves the tools, and resets his life; cost is on the page. 3:17 functions as a persistent constraint shaping choice and the final image. Causality is lyric but coherent; no teleports or late rule patches.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ritual step coheres toward a closure image (the tube into the downspout → wells) with an on‑page cost. Orientation is fast and clean (who/where/when established in the first lines), and causality flows through motivated actions rather than coincidence. Closure reads as Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing: redemption reframed as illuminating breaks, not erasing them. The single artifact—an incomplete final sentence—doesn’t damage structural closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: giggle appears → harp as conduit → lure and pause → capture → cost. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the closure lands on-page with felt price (tooth dissolves, snapped string, promise to return with an empty cord). The final reconfiguration—laughter integrated into Elara, gorge’s exhale—reads as a resonant cadence, not a soft reset. The drive holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: equations accrue until the decisive offering of the strap reweights everything. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with cost (surrendering the anchor, accepting approximation). Orientation is clear and consistent, and the final image retrofits earlier beats. The price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural progression tightens from market observation → painting’s micro‑detail cue → portal crossing → return and renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (giving up the fragment and identity shift from “translator” to “listener”). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the pattern (hidden details as doors) is taught and paid off. Final images (makeshift lighthouse, laughing children) are causally and thematically reweighted by the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: lights die → ghosts arrive → ceiling spiral → ladder → cupola → mainspring unwound → release → partial re‑coil and carry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts the burden and alters the rule by exporting it via elevators. Cost is legible in her self‑diagnosed “cracks” and the choice to carry tension forward. No orientation debt; pattern holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural causality is clean: reading frost code → composing the sentence → uncorking the whisper → rupture. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the library destabilizes, the keeper dissolves, and Corwin accepts a new stance (stepping onto negotiable air). Orientation is precise from the first line, and the pattern is taught and held. The price—loss of the “perfect system” and ink of the sentence entering his skin—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural drive, the piece builds from dispute and storm to the elegiac intervention that reweights the frame (Conceptual Repricing). The cost is legible: bodily blood given, defiance of guild doctrine, and the storm’s jeopardy as the mirror fractures and time “pauses.” Orientation is clean early (asteroid, forum, guilds, storm), and the pattern teaches itself and pays off in the mirror’s reaction. The closure image decisively reframes stakes: history becomes rewriteable via symbol, not empire.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is tight: covenant → truth‑tether → chip seated → orrery sings → sky breaks. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the drive lens holds through closure. Cost is on‑page in the confession and surrender (“pockets lighter”), and the final rule change (lies to sparks) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The boyhood chip coincidence is seeded and doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clean accumulative drive: compass → cliffs → stair → lagoon → tribute → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost (she forfeits her collected rains; the compass dissolves into her), achieving a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early and the folklore rule (lagoon reachable after shutdown) coheres and pays off. The final image reweights the premise without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: storm, slide, archway patterns densify into a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page via the sculpture’s creation, the slide dissolving into wood, and the GPS refusal (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise), with conceptual cost legible. Orientation is clean from line one; no lens ambiguity. The final image reweights the premise (arch as ledger; Maela as scribe) without an explain‑everything coda.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds as seasonal beats accrue toward a conceptual repricing (“the dark remembers what the day forgets”). The postcards → glass → painting pattern coheres causally, and the moonflower opening provides a credible tightening. However, the final line is truncated (“reminding the world that the dawning hush is”), blunting the closure cadence and dulling the cost’s final imprint. Earlier closure signals still mitigate, but the ending’s execution hurts immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clear causal chain under an accumulative lens: lagoon traps via memory, she learns its rule, trades future for past, receives the decisive page, then chooses to publish. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and sustained. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost: futures foreclosed, reputation/life at risk, truth irreversibly released. Persistent constraints (lagoon’s trap, sand, storm, Council threat) shape tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: scavenging → mandala → bell → lanterns responding → blueprint → decisive smash → first exile’s return. The closure lands with cost (sacrificing the relic to catalyze revival). Minor ding: the final sentence truncates, blurring the cadence of closure even though a clear turn has already occurred. Causality is clean with pattern‑taught motifs paying off.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural drive is taught immediately and held through closure. Causal steps are legible within the lyric frame: shaving appears → decision to immerse → memory loop → realization the foghorn migrates into him → acceptance and ritualized inscription. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the orchard will be gone; he becomes the city’s subsonic grief. Orientation is crisp early (Harriman Tower orchard at dawn) and consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat concentrates order against chaos (seeds → breath → cap → oak) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost: she pays heat, foregoes passage, and accepts the archivist role as the dome reseals. Causality is clean and motif-powered, with no teleporting props or late rules. The future-doorway deferment reads intentional and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative pressure (barometer dips, rope’s tug, clock to 04:00) coheres toward the bell substitution and a clean on‑page closure. The final act reconfigures the premise—civic siren replaced by the bell—at real conceptual cost. Causality is tight: anomalies prompt tactic change; the timer fires; bell tolls encode the microclimate. The earned quiet after zero hour reads as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterns of hush → glow → vision → renunciation culminate in a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Closure is on-page with cost: he abandons the lantern and the post after reweighting vulnerability as “atmosphere.” Causality inside the magical logic is coherent (the fleck catalyzes the vision; empathy deepens the glow). The final images (open dome, afterimages, shard by the road) lock a before/after with durable consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual → new ghost → discovered fracture/dream → choice/vow → sealing. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the vow and placement of the box in the hive reconfigure stakes with cost. Orientation and rule-set are taught early and pay off. The fracture functions as a concrete pressure point tightening to the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: from discovery (time capsule, tags) to experiment (noon taste) to exchange (garage sale trade) to conceptual reframing. Causality tracks and the damaged capsule cleanly motivates the tag‑economy. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—time becomes story/currency—though the final line (“By dusk, the sale dispersed”) feels clipped, softening cadence and cost on the page. Orientation is strong early and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first image through closure: fragments accrue, music joins, spiral unwinds, and the final repricing lands in the erasure. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid with visible costs (sleeve torn, feather given, words surrendered) that reweight his ongoing practice. Orientation is clean from the opening; the storm and snapped kite seed the later reconfiguration. The final “door left ajar” image crystallizes the before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught and held: copper network expands, animals join, and the on‑page closure is the bodily circuit that lights the temple. Causality is clean within the magical‑real rules set by the grown architecture. Cost is legible in the self‑soldering act and the horizon “dissolving.” Orientation is established early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from observation to realization: footprints → measurements → conceptual repricing of “home.” Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and the system of the pilgrimage is legible. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she leaves to fight, with “last free choice” underscoring cost. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but the before/after reweighting is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and holds: ritual acts layer until the concord accepts the “truce encoded in chlorophyll.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality is lyrical but coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost—the first shoot breaking, the box emptied, and his inward constriction easing. The price remains mostly emotional rather than situationally forced, holding it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: relics → riddle → decoded coordinates → trek → rescue. The phonograph/leaf mechanism is seeded early and pays off without feeling like a late rule change. Closure lands decisively with a reunion image that reconfigures the premise (distance taught to kneel). The cost is more lyrical than punishing, but it’s present (time, labor, Scraps’ limp, the leaf’s softening).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure tightens from compass twitch → voice → illicit light → hidden crawlspace → moving maps → apparition → hand-taking, delivering an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the accumulative lens holds to closure. The final jacket/sketchbook tableau provides cost and aftereffect without mechanical explanation. No causal breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens reads as accumulative/textural with clean causal pivots (the bishop swap alters the board’s gravity; the sundial’s shadow becomes a stair). Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Halcyon departs, the spire collapses, and the mantle is passed. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the pattern taught at the outset pays off at the end. The price—surrendering the hour, losing the lord/spire—charges the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Situational lens holds: the patrol’s arrival tightens pressure, the improvised “game” reconfigures options, and the closure lands as Charged Poise with a felt price (foregoing violence, carrying the board into risk). Orientation is clear from the first lines (interregnum, gallery, chessboard) and pays off thematically. The on‑page cost is legible in the vow to resist erasure and the rifle rendered “useless” against their declared kingdom of small gestures. Clean single-scene arc, one decisive deepening, no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: each step (stone hum → descent → feather writing → cracking) tightens toward a ritual culmination with on‑page cost. Closure largely lands (mercury shell breaking, stone crumbling), but the final sentence is truncated (“unfurl like”), blurring cadence at the moment of release. Orientation is clean and maintained; cause/therefore links are solid. The price of shedding the shell is legible but the incomplete last beat undercuts impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fountain → tapestry → internal chess diagram → physical maze → righted king → resumed time. Closure lands on the page with cost through a decisive act that reconfigures meaning and consequence. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and setups pay off cleanly. The causal throughline is quiet but consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens coherently: light→echoes→images→listening→crack→feather→departure. The closure lands on the page with cost (Earned Stasis/CR): she accepts the price, rejects the priests’ ritual, and redefines the truth’s ownership. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the one-hour clock plus approaching bells maintain temporal pressure. The lens holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single continuous scene with a tight causal thread: mapping → alignment → healing → sinking. The breath clock and chain countdown provide persistent constraint and visible cost at closure. The decisive act (pressing the charm) triggers a paid consequence on the page. Hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds cleanly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative causal chain holds: the cracked mirror prompts the inland turn, which leads to the cave, the shell, the copy, and the transference. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the quay is preserved below as the real coast is erased above, with a visible price (departure, relinquishment). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the pattern of discovery is taught and paid off. No unkept setups; the mirror returns conceptually via the junk dealer beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: waiting → ritual assembly → release → response → repricing of the mother’s fate. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the boat’s slight course change and the mother’s “vibrations” recast the world’s rules with emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first line; no causality break. The price—lifelong transmitting in solitude—registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens coheres: midnight calls escalate tasks toward a clear closing act. Closure lands on the page with felt cost as her seams loosen and she becomes the place (RR with DC overtones). Moon‑phase constraints and failed hydraulics persist through the ending image. Every beat causally or pattern‑logically feeds the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: find relic → involuntary confession → attempted cure via texts → planting → orchard’s transfiguration → chosen stasis. Closure reads as resonant reconfiguration with cost (she forecloses secrecy and chooses the ravine’s confessional ecology). Setups pay off (storms, roots, relic’s radius). The final line fragments mid‑thought, slightly blurring the last cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Patterned anomalies escalate causally toward a clear closure: apparition → understanding “gift as loan” → decisive release with cost → world resets. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) with a taught “observe gaps” method that the plot pays off. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid with a legible price. No dangling set‑ups; the logbook line returns as conceptual glue.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: promise → search → chip → dream/ants → cavern → doorway → keying → repriced vision → altered stance. The closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis, with the shop vision reframing the premise and a post‑vision behavioral choice (leaving the door unlocked). Orientation is crisp from line one, and the lens holds. The rising water adds a physical deadline without resolving the choice by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: climb → recognition of starlight as memory → shard’s reveal → decisive acceptance of the crown, with cost. Closure lands on the page with felt price (erasure traded for the kingdom’s remembrance and cosmic repair). The firefly clock and “final warning” create a persistent constraint sharpening the end. No causality breaks; set‑ups (astronomer, dream-map, crown) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative build lands a clear closure: a conceptual repricing as Corin chooses release over capture, paid for by destroying his product and revaluing his craft. Causality holds: confession → Mira’s counter‑move with the shell → crushing the sun → reweighted meaning. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean within the first lines. Cost is legible on the page and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images (scroll, stove, wind, footprints) build to a closure where erasure is chosen and reinterpreted as continuation. Orientation is clear early (cabin, date, grave) and the final act—setting the scroll to be erased—lands a cost on the page. The pressure coheres around whether to fix an ending versus accept the wheel. The scroll’s dissolution functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and motifs intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration where absence becomes method and the clock “breathes.” Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting loss while claiming meaning). However, a prop‑state inconsistency—reassembling the clamp inside the base, then later pocketing the screw—introduces a causality seam. Orientation is otherwise clean and the scene’s one‑window structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain is tight: plume threatens inversion → Lina risks the superstition → the rune clicks → breath crystallization reconfigures into text → release. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence: the story literally reweights the rune from trap to spiral. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when established) and sustained. The final image (rock lifting) seals a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: perfume → currents → confession-as-sound → renunciation → dissolution. Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis) is on the page: she will not exploit this, he departs, and the archive’s hum is altered. Stakes and costs are enacted, not explained; the orchard clock and “imperfect miracle” rule constrain the attempt and ending. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds from hush to self-erasure, with pattern-deepening beats (the spiral, the dictionary’s reweighting, the rules of arbitration) culminating in a clear on-page closure. Cost is legible in the name’s erasure and the slide of memories into the book, and the final Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing lands (“The witness is the witnessed”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and every beat coheres to the final cadence. No causality breaks; progression tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: anomaly → trace to last Tuesday/daughter → counterclockwise turn → identity reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with legible cost (he ceases to be “shepherd” and becomes the liminal measured space). Orientation is clear and the reflective shard (telegram/dream) is anchored to the present pressure. Minor reliance on stated philosophy over dramatized turns keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine supported by accumulative texture: laser reveals folds → two Lucs → choice to merge at the spiral. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she relinquishes the original/copy distinction to achieve a single, altered self. Orientation is clean from the first lines; set‑ups (laser, folds, “familiar strangers”) pay off. The speculative mechanics are suggestive rather than exhaustive but hold under the story’s own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear accumulative drive: scrawls → wet bleed message → hidden mezzanine → lectern/apology → burning lantern → morning refracted pane. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she leaves the lantern, forgives probability, and forecloses the compulsion with an on‑page price. Orientation is clean early (library in rain, midsummer; subway to mezzanine) and payoffs honor set‑ups (mica, clover, “house wins”). The causal seams hold even within the lyric strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs compound into a clean on‑page closure: he refuses the early “line,” then later pays by severing the booth and leaving. Because/therefore linkages hold: calls → meeting → renunciation → emergency call ignored → decisive cut. Cost is legible in the specific act of clipping copper and abandoning the post. The pattern taught by “loop/line” is kept through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: details accrue toward the decisive act of “planting” memory before demolition. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and time pressure tightens with engines, headlights, and the looming morning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she relinquishes the locket into the tube with the boy’s name, reconfiguring what preservation means. Cost is on the page and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene accumulates to the decisive act: the laugh‑catalysis and twin shards under tongue push the clock forward and reconfigure the world’s channels. Causality holds within the taught magical logic (rumor → rendezvous → reciprocal act → broadcast). Closure lands cleanly with a charged departure and the station’s renaming revealed. The conceptual cost (barter of solitude; accepting a shared debt) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: sound → spiral → stillpoint → release → reconfigured return. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he becomes the map, with the ring emptied and the forest’s pause ending. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the rule-set (ultrasonic, ring-translation) stays consistent. Cost is legible in the surrender of the tool’s hoarded language and the acceptance of inner cartography’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly flare → pen activation → contingent-filament editing → reweighted scroll and final stance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (station dims, gravity shifts, acceptance of echoing edits). Because/therefore linkage is soft but coherent within the taught rules. The ending’s charged poise (“I am listening”) reweights options without false neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: small disruptions accrete into conducting the harbor, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost: she accepts being unremembered and chooses presence over preservation (opening the empty camera, “unexposed emulsion of now”). Orientation is clean from the first lines. The ending reweights the premise without explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: the descent → discovery → deciphering → reweaving → collapse → emergence progression coheres. Orientation is firm early (who/where/goal) and the closure lands on-page with cost (archive collapses; identity and mission redefined). Causality is light but intact, with the art-cipher trail motivating each step. A bit of explanatory summation near the end trims potential sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rhythmic escalation alters options until merging becomes the only meaningful exit. Closure lands on the page with cost—“her form dispersed into golden light”—and the world rule (sound stored in matter) pays off. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/when). The “scientists in the morning” tag is an extra grace note that doesn’t undercut the earned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single‑scene causality is clear: storm disables GPS → maps/ear guide them → whisper‑key sequence opens the chamber → conceptual repricing of the labyrinth’s purpose. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, held through the resonance motif to closure. Closure lands on‑page via discovery and reframed purpose, though cost is conceptual rather than visceral. No orientation debt; the early anchors are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: shutter codes, mirror use, and darkness’s responsiveness thicken toward a cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: darkness learns to hold light; she transfers the secret and accepts ongoing maintenance. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the opening lines. The cost is conceptual but legible on the page (her silence/endurance; stars’ ephemerality), avoiding an explain‑everything tie‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images (grotto, sapling, windows) build toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page when she fuses the real sapling with the diorama—after which the town subtly reconfigures. Orientation is clean from the opening. Cost is conceptual/social more than dramatized resistance, keeping this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: whale call → raft → council confrontation → departure → harpoon unmaking. Closure lands on the page with cost as she forecloses the rebuild path and transforms the weapon. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph and pattern remains coherent. The “freedom” statement risks over‑explicitness but does not blunt the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: narration → crow exchange → wooden feather lodged in turbine → planting → sky’s lone tear → log-line repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: performance suspended, grief given weight, possibility admitted at cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (porch, turbines, mandate aftermath), and the “silence ordinance” constraint persists to the end. Causality is soft-lyric but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: harmonics → paraphrase shift (“None shall pass” → “None shall stay”) → stepping onto re‑liquidizing lake → final couplet propagating valley‑wide. Closure lands on the page with conceptual repricing and real consequence (the lake and law reconfigured; risk of entombment acknowledged). Orientation is crisp from the first sentence. The cost reads through the relinquished identity (“self‑erasure”) and the world’s changed parameters rather than a tidy victory lap.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: barter → plant‑conversation → eye‑revelation → collaborative creation → deliberate shattering → spiral garden. Closure is on‑page with cost: Milo returns the eye and “never painted again,” an Earned Stasis/CR that reweights the premise. Setups pay off (reed, marble eye, ash, courtyard arrangements), and causal links are clean. The persistent constraint (colorblindness reframed rather than cured) shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural design coheres: arrival → challenge → dissolution of routes → communal creation → offering. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lab is redefined from “lost sounds” to “learning sounds,” with the price of renouncing preservation and leaving the lens. Orientation is strong early; set‑ups (routes, lens, grid) pay off. Costs are legible though gentler than they could be.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each placement intensifies toward the decisive act of folding the final figure and choosing to leave. Closure lands on the page with cost—the mother exits the sanctuary, reweighting her craft from preservation to celebration. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/why) and the pattern is taught early and paid off. Minor softness in causality (few obstacles or reversals) keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: the ritual intensifies to the discovery of the leveraged‑debt sigil and a conceptual closure (“infinite regression of exits”). Anchors are clear early (who/where/when/post‑crash city), and each step is a legible therefore from the last. Closure carries conceptual cost—prophecy no one wants, maps that loop—without flattening into summary. The beat architecture is linear within a lyric mode and lands decisively on the reweighted final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring objects and rules (pagoda, veil, algorithms, “avoiding patterns”) build to a conceptual repricing—purify = carry gently. Orientation is clean early; transitions from archive to wasteland to tribe are legible. Closure lands on the page with a charged final image (lanterns, pagoda in bones) and a felt cost. Minor softness in causal tightening (few direct tests resist her) keeps it below 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: pattern intensifies from noticing to vault comparison to metamorphosis to charged decision. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she sacrifices self-presence to preserve hope—clearly on the page. Orientation is clean early (Mira, balcony, library above clouds) and never slips. The price is legible in the final vault and “becoming the last dusk” image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each ritual shedding deepens pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration: vows are inscribed, the plaque erected, and Aster is released. Closure lands on the page with cost (loss of reputation and certainty) and a charged final image. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cause chain is internal but coherent and motivated by the revealed con.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: serum → plant telepathy → coffee‑ring tunnel → trade → blood → miracle released → seed swallowed. Orientation is established by ~120 words (quiet tower at dawn; anesthesia). Closure lands on the page with cost and a legible before/after (question mark to period). The pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clean: psychometry → vision → projector animates → Mara inscribes release → retrieval and reading of the letter → transformation. Closure lands on the page with cost (burned envelope, relinquishment) and an RR/CR final image. Orientation is firm by the first paragraph and the accumulative pattern is taught and held. No major causality gaps or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: meteors deliver syllables that tighten meaning, leading to the decisive act of dismantling and the final dissolution. Closure lands on the page with cost (she becomes a filament), a clean Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early (tundra, aurora, equatorial mount), and set‑ups (archway, instrument) pay off. A minor grammar slip (“She tilt the tube”) is the only seam.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual intensifies into a charged act where time splits and the clock is planted, producing a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is taught early (guard, burned forest, frozen clock; glowing dune) and pays off at closure. The price is legible on the page—the guard relinquishes the clock to keep divergent time for children and forest. The ending image reweights all prior beats without explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned motifs (hum, wind, gears) tighten toward a clear decisive act (giving away the gear) that reconfigures options. Closure lands with cost—identity flake surrendered—and a resonant reconfiguration (becoming the banyan) that repurposes the opening rules. Orientation is taught early and pays off; transitions (elevator, cyclone, shore/metro flicker) are legible within the pattern. The final cadence reframes the premise without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal line: leash broke → routes tangle → guides seek hound via indirect paths → star stamp rebinds as partnership → routes clarify. Closure lands on the page with the stamping and the hound’s return (a Decisive Change with a resonant reframing). Cost is conceptual more than felt; risk and consequence for the guides are understated. Orientation is solid and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image tightens toward the charged poise of the final breathing and the “microscopic fracture” in silence. Orientation is clear early; cause-effect is lyric but coherent (carry boy → surgery → charged exchange via bolt). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—safety recast as a ledger of stolen voices. The persistent constraint (ban on speech) shapes tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is tight: lure via marginalia → contact with ink → rune activation → glamour undone. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains legible. Closure is an on‑page decisive change with conceptual cost (identity stripped; history’s “mercy” via forgetting). The drive lens reads primarily causal, held cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong accumulative structure: tapping → hollow panel → atlas → hydrophone pings → descent → pillar mechanism → conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on-page with the page sealed and the role redefined. The underwater tech is a bold turn but sufficiently foreshadowed by the rhythmic code. Cost is felt via relinquishment and duty, not spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural drive coheres: lullaby → stone hum → resonant duet → consoles wake → ignition via opera glasses → launch/broadcast. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure is an on‑page decisive change. World rules are learned through action; the causal chain holds within the piece’s magical‑tech logic. The off‑stage antagonist pressure lowers immediate consequence, softening cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: kite → coordinates → grotto → alteration → evasion → concealed exit. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: the embryo altered and hidden on her person, culminating in the “why” future that reweights institutional control. Cost is present (risk of discovery, physical strain, stolen destiny) though not catastrophic. The single‑scene window with one brief future flash preserves coherence and the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: ritual → freeze as microscope → resin‑transfer → release. Closure lands on the page with cost (letting the photograph go) and an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise vow at the tree. Orientation is clear early (arboretum on a cliff, dusk, survivor), and the ending reconfigures options without contradiction. Constraints (cliff, resin, the arboretum’s endurance) shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds from the opening tactile anchor to the final portal; the lighthouse’s contraction and the mirror’s reconfiguration build to a clear, costly closure. The Decisive Change lands on the page when he paints and steps through a door “only the drowning could open.” Causal threads (box → card‑lantern → mirror‑door) are clean and integrated. Cost is unmistakable: collapse impending, descent into drowning as chosen fate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: bootprint → ink → drone patterning → symbol/hourglass → well/journal → portal → choice. Closure lands with on‑page cost: he abandons his world to enter a temporal fold, a decisive change with conceptual repricing of “crisis time.” The only softness is a slight info‑delivery via Lyra’s portal explanation, but it doesn’t break the lens or the cost. Orientation is solid from the opening line; the accumulative texture supports the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening and the causal chain is tight: wake → discover letter → decide → transmit → consequences bloom. The closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: she seeds upheaval then chooses suspension, accepting potential destruction. Cost is legible on the page via explosions, incoming footfalls, and her pledge to share the archive’s fate. The drive lens remains coherently causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images accrue toward the planting and the root-pulse. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when, cause of loss). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost—braiding violence into peace—enacted by planting at the airbag’s fall site. Because/therefore threads are soft but coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative design coheres: constellations descend, threat issued, spike driven, echo reframed into “Stay,” and a resonant reconfiguration lands. Because/therefore links hold even in the lyric register (silence method → garden behavior → spike as channel → reweighted insight). The cost is subtle but legible—the trade of pursued capture for conversational reciprocity and the foreclosed path of “the first cry.” Orientation is clean from the outset; closure lands with on‑page images and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the projection, inscriptions, and escalating contradictions form a taught pattern culminating in “The story continues.” Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: the orbit cracks, tactics shift, and papers below change. Cost is on-page at the peak beat (the nib breaks), and the lens holds cleanly. Orientation is early and solid (observatory, journalist call, projector).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Patterned causal chain (tether → projection → menu → letters bind → second menu → release) reads coherent under a hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is strong from the first line and holds. Closure lands via a decisive choice (RELEASE) that reconfigures the premise with a legible emotional price. The cost could be sharpened, but the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the hush thickens, the mandala densifies, the tile reorganizes into one whisper, culminating in a conceptual repricing. Orientation is immediate (Mira, grotto, unlearning) and the closure lands with cost: she empties pockets, blanks the tile, and accepts erasure as necessary. Because/therefore pressure is subtle yet coherent (inviting the hush, receiving its answer, choosing to scatter). The final image reweights the premise without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present labor interleaves with charged recollection, culminating in a CR/RR where “map of forgetting” reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early (plaza, minaret, shattered sky), and the closing legend beat lands cost without soft resets. The forty‑nine‑day motif and dawn timing provide subtle structural tightening. No causality breaks; the closure moment is on the page and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes and threads densify into a present-tense reconfiguration (heartbeat/applause) with a felt price (Lila’s vanishing; continued invisibility). Orientation is clear early and remains stable (theater → maze → orchard stage). Closure lands on the page with a decisive cadence shift, though the cost is more bittersweet than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clear: static shock → awareness → compulsion → collective web → shutter closes/photo remains. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance and a captured image that outlasts the telepathic fade), with conceptual cost. However, the final sentence truncates (“looked at each”), blurring the intended cadence and slightly dulling the closure’s punch. Causal links hold, but the incomplete final beat lowers confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: mapping → anomaly → contact → inversion → voice → reconfigured tool/mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (drain, collapse, transformed staff). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the decisive act reweighting all prior material. The final image (floating staff guiding future wakers) provides a concrete after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: warehouse arrival → classification → echo release → spiral → resealing → outward offering. Closure is a conceptual repricing: prophecy reframed from narrowing fate to communal reassembly, with the jar’s changed weight as cost proxy. Orientation is clean from the copper sky opening onward; all set-ups (jar, buttons, prophecy) pay off on the page. The final image (sharing warm silence to a villager) crystallizes the new tactic and forecloses her former role.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is tight: code → hatch power via pillbox → transmitter boot via limited turbine trickle → confession → burst transmission → destruction of the tool/legend. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with cost on the page (self‑exposure, burning the last cover). Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the drive lens remains coherent through the final image. No unkept setups; each object returns with paid purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the gutters’ clock, the needle-threading, and fog-walk build to a clear CR/RR at the end. Closure is on the page with cost: the coach dissolves; he internalizes the sphere and leaves his role. Orientation is clean from the opening; the taught pattern pays off when silence triggers the river’s reconfiguration. No causality breaks; each beat follows the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: thrum → visions of fractured timelines → clay hive → alignment of glass → bees’ return → covenant with the child. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the rule that memory travels forward only when carried by kindness, with the lantern glass as conduit. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single‑scene flow honors scope. The cost is legible (transience, departure), though escalation remains gentle rather than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: theft → lock → descent → boy → ascent → garden → relinquishment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy leaves with lavender and “a small reflected moon,” while Mara pays with risk and the lost tool. The lock’s click and the tooth’s fall provide on‑page cost and a before/after hinge. Orientation is anchored early; the lens holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: library → leap → henge choice → ascent; causal throughline is clean, with the core turn at the stone circle. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis when she chooses “self” and splits memory; later images extend rather than undercut it. Minor ding for the final sentence’s truncation, which blurs the last cadence even though the earlier closure is intact. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story builds through image and ritual to a resonant reconfiguration and quiet decisive change. The closure lands on the page with the offering, the confession, and the choice to stop ghosting; cost is conceptual but legible (foreclosing the role that once defined her). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (twig spiral, “keeper of secrets,” mirror labyrinth) pay off at the pond. The throughline from temple to installation reads coherent and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal drive is solid: discovery → plan → eclipse window → interference → retreat. The climax lands with a decisive change (entities veer away) and some resonant repricing (trust as battleground), though execution leans expository. The truncated final sentence is a polish flaw but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is clean by the first lines (fallow period; nexus; Arin’s aim) and the structure escalates to an on‑page closure. The closure unit lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she takes the key and forecloses return; the world reconfigures with cost. The accumulative pressure (organ, spatial mutiny, shaft, mirrors) coheres under a tight causal thread. No dangling setups; the missing pane and dawn image finalize consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coherent causal chain: research → quarry setup → pigment from ribbon → painted puncture → water clears → mask recovered → name triggers divers. The magical mechanism is taught early and enacted, not tacked on, and the closure lands on-page with concrete consequence. Cost registers as relinquishment of the work to the sheriff and a charged acceptance of her cognitive limitation. Orientation (who/where/when) is secured quickly and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens reads Causal: decoding → confrontation → joint model overlay → dirigible retrieval → appeal → chosen stasis. Closure lands with cost as she refuses immediate return despite reversal granted, reframing exile. Orientation is clean from the first line; constraints (storms, restricted zone) persist and shape tactics. A small coincidence (wreck proximity) is acknowledged and then solved through agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: music→echo→doorway shadow→pixel reassembly→bridging. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she crushes the flake and steps onto the unfinished bridge; at dawn only the violin remains. Orientation is clean early (single POV at a mountain pullout at dusk), and the magical logic is taught and honored. The causal chain within the poetic rules reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure builds to a resonant reconfiguration: reinterpreting territorial markers and releasing the notes recasts the loop. Causality is coherent and anchored early; the persistent constraint (orphaned train/startup fallout) shapes options. The cost lands on‑page (abandoning the satchel, foreclosing return). The final sentence truncation slightly blurs cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star‑timed witnessing → doorway vision → healing act → vow and shared burden. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: temple’s credo, the healed instrument, the handoff of the telegram, and the star’s wink, with cost (temple crumbles; she carries the echo). Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and set‑ups pay off. Slight smoothness in obstacles keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene causal chain is tight: failed mirror trick → lake trial → expanding circles → confession → environmental reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the confession alters the orchard’s motion and binds her arm, with conceptual and physical cost. The drive reads accumulative with a clear cadence break at the seventh circle. No orientation debt; the pattern taught early pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive lands a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant rekindled as photosynthesis and the maze blooming from the narrator’s scar. Because/therefore links are steady (heed whisper → enter maze → gardener’s offer → chosen “now” → communal rooting). Cost is conceptual but legible on the page: surrendering paved time and hosting a living hedge in a wound. Orientation is taught early and retained; closure feels clean.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    A tight causal chain: the orchard as market → the ask shifts (sunrise rejected; mother’s hum demanded) → the trade → immediate cost → attempted renegotiation → thematic refusal with a reweighted final image. Orientation is swift and stable; the drive lens reads Hybrid with accumulative texture and causal beats, held through closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: acceptance that some holes must remain, with a price borne by both. The cost is on‑page (lost memory, Lira’s depletion) and charges the last image (star sprout humming).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-POV, one-scene frame with clear anchors and a tight accumulative build from cloth → echo → speck memory → call. Closure lands as a decisive change (she initiates a workshop), with an implied cost of reentering a judged arena. Because/therefore linkages are clean even in lyric mode. The cost is present but a shade soft, keeping this just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative design tightens cleanly: arbor signals → seed activation → mirrored sky symmetry → mother’s waveform → archive restored → new plank. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (“haunted ambitions” reframed as love learning new shape) and a concrete world change (bridge extends). Orientation is crisp from the first sentences; no causality breaks. Cost is legible as relinquishment of a literal return in favor of a pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lunar tide and catalog entropy mount toward a Charged Poise closure. The decisive act is planting the creel to anchor memory against her future forgetting; the cost is legible in “feeling the hollow adjust around absence” and the acceptance of releasing the ribbon later. Orientation is clean from the first line; pattern is taught early and paid off. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor → ajar door → etched confessions → crown → mirror → dissolution into caretaker. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the final image makes the forfeiture and new charge undeniable. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph; the motifs are paid off in the mirror scene. The pearl’s dissolution provides a concrete hinge that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural structure tightens cleanly from arrival to ritual to release; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the offering and final forgiveness. Costs are on-page (withdrawal tremor, ritualized relinquishment, choosing to “stay” rather than eternally chase). The final truncated sentence (“For the first time, the”) mars the cadence and slightly blurs the landing. Orientation is solid early; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rules accrete (backward watch, echo‑grammar, mirrored debts) and culminate in a conceptual repricing with cost. The closure lands on-page: trade made, collapse triggered, reset at riverbank with altered terms (lost lullaby, missing second letter). Setups pay off (cipher’s reversal, watch’s stutter as warning). Minor ambiguity in mechanics never harms the closing beat’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: note → coffee augury → droplet vision → orchids’ pressure → coffee poured on violin → song → doorway. Closure lands on the page with a reconfigured world-image (perforated garden destiny) and a concrete aftermath (puddle, coffee ring, rumors). The drive lens holds Hybrid with causal dominance at the end. The cost is legible: personal vanishing and a world that accepts ambiguity over seamless order.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: ritual actions stack until the aurora’s contraction precipitates the reweighting. Closure lands on the page with explicit cost (“one life surrendered”) and a reconfigured premise (she becomes the lantern/ferryman). Orientation is clean within the first sentence (who/where/why). The ending’s studio coda seals consequence without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Causal: each image-triggered beat tightens causally (forgiveness births the boy; his dissolution forces the hairpin stab; the fused relic installs cost; the grotto’s law requires a death). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she renounces the upward quest and descends with felt cost (the boy’s death) and a reweighted rule‑set for the valley. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind chime codes, the voiding shard, and dawn cohere toward a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on the page when her offer reframes the project from data to “killing something ancient,” and their certainty is “unhooked,” with the cost of investors, careers, and grief present. Orientation is clear early and the single scene sustains pressure. The shard’s final image as a vessel of grief returns to the sea with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure teaches its pattern through the rings, culminating in a clean on‑page conceptual repricing: appearing/vanishing redefined, with Elara’s disappearance as visible cost. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). Setups (stone, withholding, meridians) pay off coherently in the closure image. The causal weave is light by design, but the pattern holds and the price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs (pulse, birds, bone towers) densify to a closure where he “becomes the echo.” Closure occurs on the page via the arrowhead merging and the canyon singing back; the conceptual cost is the surrender of movement/individual separateness, which reads as an Earned Stasis/CR. Orientation is firm from the outset (who/where/what he seeks). The tightening is singular but meaningful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive holds: glow → doorway → traversal → marigold → petal → crack → mailing → charged return to balcony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts a cost (keystone fracture, relinquishing the flower to a petal sent away) and awaits unplanned scatter, not the scheduled sunrise. Orientation is clean from the opening and causality tracks without patching. Cost is legible on the page (“the keystone cracked… runes that no longer needed to pretend they were useful”).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → key → wreck → safe → cylinder → repricing → return, with each beat intensifying pattern and meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sound becomes light “still searching for an eye,” and Jin’s return to signify vows reframes his vocation. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence; the through‑line never tangles. Cost is implied (risk, abandonment of post) rather than dramatized at peak stress, keeping this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to closure: coin‑by‑coin intensification → Earth coin scream → mandate to “become the static” → self‑sacrifice. On‑page cost is undeniable: she dissolves, memory sheds, coins transmute into regret frequency. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) and pays off as the deck itself liquefies into the ending image. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: each magical action reweights meaning toward the conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when), and causal links are legible (ink pinhole → observatory wakes → star‑sentences → question → memory → copper mirror → release of voices → ledger). Closure lands on‑page with cost: his existence has been fed by others’ terror, and he acts to name and release what sustained him. No dangling set‑ups or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the drip cadence, doubling days, and the bell’s charged reprises escalate toward the ankle-deep wave and community adoption. Orientation is clear from the outset; causality is earned through ritualized action rather than plot contrivance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s death, the bell’s crack, and communal belief sustaining the ocean show felt cost and a reweighted rule-set. Persistent constraints (drip rate, brittle faith) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: the resurfacing town and laid photographs build pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the start, and the closure lands on the page with cost (releasing the label; choosing communal memory over secret). The wind chime’s reprise tightens the cadence into a clean, felt ending. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: discovery → ritual → revelation → decisive melting → repriced world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she exits altered in axis with costs implied by foreclosing the false split between reason and wonder. Stakes around “final transformation” stay mostly conceptual, lightly blunting felt cost, but the decisive act and its aftermath read on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid situational/accumulative lens holds: anomaly arrives → code challenge → descent → mirrored pilot → transfer of buckle. Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: she cedes the token/tool of office and reframes the oath. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (code, buckle mechanics, radio) pay off. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    The scene is tightly causal under a situational/accumulative hybrid: the confessional rounds vivify, Zero’s falter opens a narrow option, the bell imposes a clock, and Mara chooses merging. Closure lands on the page with cost (self-dissolution and a new singular parent), clearly reconfiguring the custody stake. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern is taught early and paid off. No teleports or soft resets; setups (brain, creed, rewrite) all return decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clean: envelope → planting deadline → architectural upheaval → tactical guidance → guests’ riddle → repriced ending. The closure reads as a conceptual repricing: she accepts the labyrinth as co‑author, with tomorrow’s empty envelope sealing the new rule. The cost is mostly conceptual (ceding control), not strongly dramatized as a sacrifice. Orientation is firm from the outset and the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Track A single‑scene arc with a clean accumulative/textural drive: experiment → failure → faint return → tentative success → engine death → reconfigured silence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the house “exhales” and the hourglass/cord image reweights the rules of loss with cost. Orientation is clear within the first lines (hourglass, house, Ellery, tunnel), and each beat follows with purposeful therefore/so moves under the lyric lens. The persistent constraint (tunnel acoustics and machine limits) shapes tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: recurring objects and sensations (mist, pendant, sundial) ratchet the pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when the pendant cracks and she accepts dissolution into attendance—an earned stasis with felt cost (identity surrendered, prowling foreclosed). Orientation is clear early (feral guardian, frozen garden at night), and the ending image cleanly reframes the premise. The before/after is legible in the shift from guarding books to guarding boundaries as self.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with strong causal spine: theft → ritual assembly → frost repair → ash contradiction → creature → sacrifice → sealing the nexus. Closure lands on the page with cost (blindness; sealing power) and a conceptual repricing (“nothing whole stays holy”). The ending’s price shapes future options: he commits to preaching blind beside a volatile miracle. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and every move pays off a prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → reorientation → decisive tuning culminates in a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (sublimating the gold). Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and causal linkages are coherent (“she set the fragment... the shard slid toward it... she tuned... silence expanded”). Closure is strong and legible in the final image (“needle finding the groove”) reweighting all prior material. Minor limit: danger window is felt but not sharply constricting, tempering the cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, beats link cleanly: barnacle coordinates → radio self-warning → half-here hull → hourglass maneuvers → grotto closing → decisive merge. Closure lands on the page: engines catch, passengers solidify, hourglass crumbles, and Arden pockets the brass caps. Cost is present (surrendering the hourglass and accepting a chosen transience). The “reverse the pour” solution slightly softens the starkness of the earlier stated price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural structure tightens as weaving alters the gallery, culminating in a conceptual repricing: she is the thread and the space between. Orientation is strong from the outset; the pattern is taught and coheres. Cost is legible at closure (spool emptied; the composite man dissolving). Minor softness in causal stakes prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: class → alien craft confirmation → private lesson → transfer of the link → charged poise at dawn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she gives up the link and reframes absence as a “perfect, navigable void,” with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and causality is coherent. Persistent constraint (benthic life, sealed sky) shapes tactics through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative drive is clean: photo → atrium → pulse → name → encounter → synchronized release. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration (Eleanor’s heart at rest; Mira’s aid silent) with a felt cost. The coincidence of the niece arriving at the same time is acceptable under the chosen lens given the taught “call” logic. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive holds: gold fleck → narrowing corridor → naming the fused crew → hand over trunk → reverse phase and emergence. Closure lands with cost: restoration achieved, but the obligation to remember reweights the world (“names repeating in her chest”). Orientation is clear from the outset and the causal chain is legible without patches. The only convenience—swift restoration—has groundwork in the gold fleck and Voss’s kept circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure coheres: clerical error → ghosthood tactics → ink‑map defrag → reentry → clerk encounter → exit before dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: failure reframed as corridor/telescope with the shard and heartbeat count charging cost. Stakes tighten with the dawn correction clock and the risky return to flesh, paid off on the page. The ink mechanic is poetic rather than literal, but it’s taught and functionally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: river‑tongue’s last breath → descent into the echo tunnel → syllable amplification → self‑sacrifice. Closure is on‑page and costly: calcification and death reconfigure the world so the language persists. Causality is clean (diamond whispers → translation attempt → curse seeps → swallow → towers speak). Orientation is clear and functional within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: environment and motif density build to a resonant reconfiguration as Vale becomes the “harmony untamed.” Causality is legible (phone → realization → arrowhead resonance → ascension) with on‑page cost. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, aim) and the ending’s charged image lands. Minor late flourish beyond closure is fine, though a clipped fragment slightly mars the final third’s smoothness.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene causal chain is tight: music disrupts statues, access opens, seed is uprooted, orchard transforms. Closure lands decisively on the page with cost (shell sacrificed; bridge dissolves; Calla leaves), and the final image reconfigures meaning (statues become trees; rumor replaces presence). Orientation is clean from the first sentence; no teleports or soft resets. The drive lens reads predominantly causal with a lyrical finish, held coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid but leaning accumulative/causal: the plan (data‑dot + storm decoy) tightens pressure into the drone sweep and escape, landing in a charged poise. Closure is present (message planted, diversion sprung, stance set), but the final incomplete sentence blurs the cadence and dampens cost. Orientation is crisp early; set‑ups (Sky Empress, neon EM) pay off. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping it below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: search → corridor of backward aging → oasis/pool → halo revelation → memory-song → departure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as music-bearing, with the halo dissolving into him. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the final image reweights earlier motifs with on‑page cost (leaving, not looking back). No causality breaks; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each step (polaroid → mirror/endcap → catalog number → door → shell‑room) tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page with cost (scarf torn; time released; geometry relaxes). Orientation is clean early and used to charge the ending image. Minor note: causality is lyric rather than obstacle‑driven, but coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: preparation → causeway crossing → dawn painting → decisive shutter → transfer of image to shelves → voices restored. The drive lens reads accumulative/textural with causal turns, landing a resonant reconfiguration when the archipelago “develops” and the library pulses with longing. Closure is on‑page, but the price—implied memory trade or self‑transformation—is evocative rather than explicit. No orientation debt; the pattern is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid: star’s hint → bruise/lock → song → unraveling → disorientation → release. Closure lands with a decisive change (the idea freed) and a resonant coda (his own silver curl), though the cost remains soft. Pattern is taught early (star/nexus rules) and held through the end. The final fragment (“And though the”) slightly mars cadence but not the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: return → detection of Pleiades bruises → sextant mirrors → temptation → decisive cut → star realignment and memory return. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing (“never stolen; offered”), and the environment participates. Cost is primarily reframed rather than paid anew, softening impact. Still, structure is tight within one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: tea leaves → sealing ritual → library’s response → mentor’s name → child’s choice → repriced exile. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: exile rewritten into a loop with a conceptual and emotional cost for Lira. Orientation is clean from the first line. Persistent constraints (reversible exile, pinned shadow) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive with clean causal steps: build → attune → capture → backlash/door → renunciation → seeding the world. Closure lands on‑page with conceptual and felt cost (sacrifice of the loom, personal aging, life-direction shift). Orientation is clear by the first lines, and the lens holds to the end. The persistent constraint (the veil widening) shapes the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: each knot unspools stored speech, tightening pressure toward the personal secret. Closure lands decisively with a renunciation and immediate world reconfiguration (mask to sand, spirit freed), with felt cost on the page. Orientation is clear from the opening (who/where/what) and the causal rhythm of needle → release → pressure intensifies holds. The final image redirects the premise without back‑filling exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: investigation → site entry → charged waiting → map reknits → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands on the page via RR/CR: the henge’s rule clarifies and the map mends, with a felt price in her stance shift. Orientation is clean early and the mosaic with reels is legible; the clipped final dash hints continuity but doesn’t undercut the closure already achieved. Setups (films, tear, axiom) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: details and objects accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The decisive reconfiguration is clear and costly on the page—she replaces the DC‑3 with her brother’s tags and ascends, reframing the “last transmission” as her own heart’s admission. Setups (journal, measurements, globe) pay off in the ending image and note. Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, why) and the price persists in what she leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: painting → echo’s intervention → moths awaken → release of petals → communal broadcast. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she abandons preservation for communal signal, with the cost visible in the emptied plate and dissolved echo. Orientation is clean from the outset (courtyard above clouds; lightning/thunder clock). The causal linkage is lyrical but legible at each intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: goggles → cipher → observatory → diary → map → descent → seed planted. Closure lands with a decisive change (she stops ascending socially and commits to rooting below) and tangible costs (forsaking duty, giving up her thimble, choosing a new role). The gust unlocking the diary reads as rule-consistent magic rather than convenience. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the fraying cable and intensifying catalog accumulate toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure. The on‑page cost is legible as she relinquishes safety and lets the telescope become memorial while she floats—ending options reweighted. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the constraint (snapping cable) shapes tactics throughout. The final image (“a brass telescope full of spooled wholeness” falling) seals the repricing with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: coin code → method → siren countdown → explosion → charged exit. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines “portrait” via absence and preserves memory with visible cost as the building falls. Orientation is anchored early and never wobbles. The coin mechanics and demolition clock motivate each intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal spine is clean: dimming lamps → Lira’s pattern‑finding → story as fuel → reading the dog‑ear → ship relit and a new charted route. Orientation is strong from the first lines; the drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric inflection. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a resonant reconfiguration of social dynamics. The cost is mostly emotional/vulnerable rather than materially felt, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: prophecy → search → failed gear tests → mirror insight → key repaired → door/chamber → irrevocable step. Closure lands on page with cost: the doorway vanishes and he accepts custodianship—an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid. Setups (eclipse-timed lock, broken key) pay off cleanly without coincidence solving the problem. Orientation is crisp from line one; no penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean accumulative structure across three dawns: messages → mobilization → coordinated harvest → release. Causality holds: dying anti‑grav seeds necessitate harvest; chalk prompts action; bell organizes cadence; success loosens Mara’s tether. Closure lands on‑page with cost as Mara rings farewell and dissolves into the nebula. The epilogue reweights the arc without soft‑resetting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (hush, nested patterns) and coheres through the iterations of the lullaby to a clear Earned Stasis: she becomes the pane’s backing. Orientation is clean from the lighthouse entrance onward and the cost is on the page. The backward ticks and branching lifelines provide decisive reconfiguration without mechanical over‑explanation. No causality breaks; the closure image is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene structure with a clean clock, consistent rules, and a tight causal chain culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. The decisive image—the travelers’ escape as frost seals her prints—lands with felt cost (she remains bound; the seed is spent). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the drive lens (situational pressure with causal tactics) holds. No stray setups; all introduced elements pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear accumulative structure: ravine → insight → weeks‑later execution → installation and departure, with because/therefore linkage intact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara converts absence into communal resonance and relinquishes the artifacts, paying a visible emotional price. Orientation is clean early; the lens holds through the finale. The causal chain keeps faith with set‑ups (foam pattern → foam‑templated resin → touch‑activated laughter).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each sale reweights the environment until the library tilts, prompting the decisive act of self-becoming-a-door. Closure lands with conceptual and felt cost; before/after is unmistakable. Orientation is strong from the opening (“glass orchard library,” “opening-day lull”), and setups pay off (bottles, scales, parole). Minor causal leaps stay poetic rather than incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-POV accumulative structure tightens cleanly: fortress → descent → drowning pressure → reciprocal offering → altered gift. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: “now they passed through her like breath,” with the environment visibly transformed. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words and the drive lens holds. The cost is legible at the pivot (“subsume… completely”) and the ending image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions cascade from the snapped weight to liturgical repair to the 4:43 transformation and reciprocal song. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the system’s conversation is restored and reweighted (bird becomes elevator; shared custodianship). Causality is legible and tidy without contrivance. The cost is modest but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single continuous scene with clean causal flow: calibration → activation → possession/fusion → partial creation → lunar shift → collapse → aftermath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (blood, burned mirror, failed extraction) and changed options (sketches, new seams, renewed plan). The lunar angle functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the climax. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; lens reads as Hybrid with accumulative texture paying off under causal constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: inversion opens thresholds → doodle reveals lock → palm press releases combinations → self‑translation. Closure lands on the page with cost (she becomes the archive; grotto emptied; symbol inscribed). Orientation is clear by the first paragraph; the hour constraint frames the window even if not actively counted down. The chain is motivated and clean without late rule cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: mapping cracks, then strumming, then the grove’s response, culminating in a charged poise ending. Orientation is immediate (grove, fallen alder statue, Ilay) and the causal sequence is coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost (self‑slowing, trembling, refusal to cheer) and a reconfigured option (tomorrow’s wire to carry song). If anything, the cost is subtle, but the RR is clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural structure holds: the silence’s “electromagnetic whispers” cohere into legible patterns that prompt the charged decision to act before the “next phase.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he reframes exile as transposition—and the turning from the nexus embodies that shift. The price is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each tuned frequency deepens pressure toward the clasp opening. Closure lands on page (clasp sighs, mirror/poppy reprice the premise) with cost reframed as chosen burden. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when and the fireworks clock). If anything, the obstacle yields a touch smoothly, but the internalized price maintains stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density and ritual actions build toward a quiet but clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with a tangible price—she relinquishes the urge to astonish and offers the journal to the “wind‑spirits.” Orientation is swift and firm (who/where/when clear), and set‑ups pay off (custom, seed, tide, indigo paper). Stakes are modest but coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: water-reading → Silent Core → arrow-tip → inversion → sapling insertion → repricing of “resilience.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on‑page cost (she gives memories) under a live clock (the hour) and persistent constraint (inversion). Orientation is crisp from the first sentence, and the pattern taught early pays off at the apex arch. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure coheres: investigation → discovery of spiral → transmission → escape as the convergence collapses. Causality holds with a slight magical nudge (the patch’s pull) that was seeded and doesn’t undercut agency. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: she exits with knowledge while the port transforms irreversibly. The stakes tighten cleanly without digressions.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single, coherent scene with a live clock culminating in a simultaneous strike delivers on‑page closure with cost (bell cracked; world reweighted). Because/therefore linkages are clean: glyphs → tuning → poised strike → fused impacts → release. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds. The trailing fragment (“The amber music sheet, now”) is a line‑level slip but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the hush thickens, the seam glows, the driftwood reconfigures, and options reweight toward a charged refusal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she leaves the flute and forecloses the crossing, with conceptual and material cost on the page. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and causal beats stay coherent within the lyric frame. The final image reconfigures the premise without breaking world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is clean: halo → unintended sentence → personality‑borrowing intensifies → child of light → reversal with rekindled stars and eroded self. Closure lands as a decisive act with conceptual repricing: empathy as subtraction with the cost of losing carried lives. The drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal and holds to the end. Price is on the page: “his own heart blank as unprinted paper.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural design is coherent: pendant vibration → apparition → revelation → dissolution → step forward. Closure is on-page via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: courier becomes message with a conceptual cost (identity surrendered to myth). Orientation is clean and the ridgeway seam reweights prior detail. Minor reliance on the stranger’s exposition keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens through the “shifted hush,” the lies, and the prism’s flare. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration—he repositions grief, leaves the prism, and walks out under a reweighted rule set. Cost is legible on the page (fractured prism, acceptance without consolation). Orientation is clean from line one; no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → assembly → portal → bargain → sacrifice → aftermath. Closure is on-page and costly; the final image (petal with runes, beadless tears) confirms consequence. Orientation is solid from the outset (loom spinner in orchard at night) and the accumulative texture supports the causal throughline. A minor gap in pre-bargain motivation prevents the leap to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal flow: barter → descent → jam → cut → smelter/mural projection → gong → confrontation → arches tremble → capitulation. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (collectors yield) and a cost (loss of the silk, risk in the fall). The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric inflection and holds through the ending. The collectors’ quick reversal is the only soft spot, though the arch tremor provides sufficient forcing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: shard → loom → locker → note/cube → repriced mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—her complicity and a redirected life’s work—on the page. The shard/tool functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and exit image. Slight convenience in the note/cube mechanism, but it fuels, rather than replaces, the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure holds cleanly to the end, with the lamp’s earlier failure tightening the present beat. Closure lands as a charged poise: the stone’s click reconfigures options (she lives; the chain holds) while his bottled light marks a costly, chosen endurance. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no causality breaks. The final image pays off seeded motifs without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure compounds through patterned acts (laughs, lens, wick) to a clear CR/RR: she relinquishes the lighthouse and role as herald to become a reader sowing prophecies. Orientation is established early (emerald lighthouse; post‑print world) and the pattern is taught and paid off. Cost is explicit (stars erased, wick consumed, lighthouse dissolves) and shapes the ending. No causality breaks; each escalation grows from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: tea house → bridge crisis/vision → meadow discovery → absorption → return, delivering a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Costs are emotional and conceptual, scaled to length, and the journey’s because/therefore links are coherent. However, the final line truncation (“—an ir”) blunts the closure image and cadence. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mapping dreams → pin’s chime → moon‑refracted trees → deconstruction → cedar. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: sorrow is transmuted and the tool redefined; the “Instructions” line locks the before/after. Orientation is clean from the opening; the pin beat cleanly tightens cadence. Cost is legible in the loss of the sextant and the acceptance of a non‑quantified future.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure tightens cleanly: attempt (solo lullaby) → complication (tarry vines, broken mica) → decisive turn (self‑wounding, recovered name) → reconfigured tactic (canon inviting mirrors). Closure lands with visible cost and a felt before/after: night scab lifted, dawn self‑sustaining. The accumulative lens holds, with causal beats linking each escalation. Orientation is clear from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive coheres: the midnight purge and Vale’s approach compress options until Elara enacts the invitation’s paradox. Closure lands on‑page with cost—the invitation goes blank as it “drinks” her, foreclosing a future. Setups (purge signal, Vale’s guilt sense, the calligraphy’s “gift of absence”) pay off precisely. Orientation is crisp from line one; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the loaf discovery → planting → sprouting → unclocked mosaics → reopened bakery form a coherent, tightening sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (secrecy, restraint, vigilance). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality cheats. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive taught early via ritualized measuring and intensifies through apparitions and the book recording her backward life. Closure lands as an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she refuses measurement, reframes the slide, and exits into unwritten air. The causal chain within the lyric mode is coherent and the cost legible; one tight turn (the archive starts archiving her) meaningfully narrows options. Minor copy slip at the very end doesn’t break closure but mars finish.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single continuous scene with a clean clock and causal turns: arrival → waiting → dawn → handover → labeled cylinder. Closure lands on the page via the decisive exchange and the recorded “small wet click,” with cost legible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of hush and rising tide tighten to a cadence shift at sunrise. Orientation is clear by the first lines; no rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural structure coheres: the staged arrivals (storm woman, frost man, aurora child) build to the election reveal and reconfigure Mira’s aim. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: from hunting anomalies to recognizing distributed emotional weather. The cost is primarily conceptual (abandoning skepticism), legible but soft. A truncated last word (“The lavender”) doesn’t break closure but slightly scuffs cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → drawing → cave response → lock/laughter → aboveground reprise. Closure lands on the page with cost (she refuses to sell portraits; leaves the lock open) and a resonant reconfiguration of the premise. Objects and environment recur causally without teleportation; setups (4‑7‑9) pay off (9‑7‑4). Orientation is clear early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal beats (map → trials → vault → letters). The closure aims for a Conceptual Repricing (“not a place but a practice”) but the final sentence truncates mid‑line, undermining the felt cadence and cost on the page. Stakes (“Speak true or the path closes”) are tested but never truly threaten loss. Without a complete final image, the before/after boundary lands soft.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural design escalates toward the comet’s pass, with clean causal links (calibration → insertion of ice → comet excitation). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ice’s costly diminishment and her wordless bequeathal reweight “wonder” into communal stewardship. Orientation is firm immediately (who/where/when), and the cost is on‑page (“iceberg shrinking,” pockets emptied). The lens holds from craft buildup to charged poise in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: the magnetic shift clock, ignition pattern, and box’s resistance stack toward the closure. Closure lands with cost as K-17 chooses to integrate and wait centuries, reconfiguring identity and the farm’s fate (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). Causality is coherent—timing and rules constrain options and shape the final image. The before/after is legible and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor → heartbeat → vigil → communal listening → quiet absorption. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses opening the box, pays the conceptual cost of unanswered mystery, and reconfigures the courtyard via the offering cushion. Orientation is clean from the first sentence, and the mailbox constraint persists. The price—relinquishing answers for witness—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure holds under a Hybrid lens with accumulative texture powered by clear causal links: decoding → dice cue → vortex ride → archive → ingestion → buoy → broadcast. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (sunken lab, timeline via spider, goal to finish the scientists’ work). Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes the vessel and pays by flooding the lab’s last air and risking herself. The final image (code as lullaby reaching a child) reweights the premise with a visible, consequential aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held; gravity fluctuations and ritual acts compound until the projection and reconfiguration of memory. Closure lands on the page with cost (matchbook sacrifice, wildflowers consumed, flame feeding on absence) and a reweighted final image (resumed rounds with reclaimed name). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/when), and causal seams are tight within the lyric mode. The before/after is legible without over‑mechanizing the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens logically: offering the wing → murmuration → anti‑sound → counter‑word → ingestion with cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and the lens holds. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he internalizes a burden that continues to “murmur against the bone,” reconfiguring options with felt cost. No unkept setups; the river and origami logic pay off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: meteor shower → seal → gargoyle speaks → tutor vanishes → narrator assumes role. Orientation is crisp from the rooftop arrival; the magical rules (meteors in hexameter, buildings speak via stress) are taught through action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (loss of tutor; inheritance of burden/“agreed upon lies”). The final “stay” reprises and reweights the premise without a mechanical tie‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each because/therefore step (shell → gate → pond → hum → archive) tightens toward a clear on‑page cost. Closure lands with a decisive change (color loss) plus a conceptual repricing (memory made communal). Orientation is clean within the first lines, and no causal seams show. The discarded shell as a period seals the structural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the sanctuary, aurora, dripping stalactites recur until the cadence break of writing in her own hand and leaving the thorn. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (identity relinquishment, blood on stone). Orientation is clean from the outset, and set‑ups (thorn, key, sister’s manifesto) pay off. The because/therefore chain is lyric rather than causal, but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: shell → descent → gallery → mother’s cocoon → finishing cadence, with on‑page closure and cost. The decisive act dissolves the cocoon and reconfigures options (travel vs reverberate). Orientation is swift and stable; the accumulative lyric texture supports, not obscures, causality. The price—letting go of the mother’s echo and foreclosing haunting—lands in the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: dream → shrine → glacier’s crack → corridor of memories → retrieval → exit → reflective coda. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the intact globe recasts the “windows of connection,” and leaving the mirror to the glacier carries conceptual cost. Orientation is clean throughout, and set-ups (cameo faces, snow globes, cold candles) pay off in the ending image. No causality breaks; the world’s rules are consistent within the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: whistling → moon paths → whisking → shadow path → step. Closure lands on the page with cost as she chooses absence over stone. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each turn grows from prior images. A minor late typo does not harm causality but prevents higher-band polish.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: letters → stillpoint → resonance → diamond → playback → decision to broadcast. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she sacrifices comfort for a truth that accelerates decay. Orientation is immediate (Geiger, “Paradise” gate), and the rule‑set (resonance access, playback at 3:03) stays consistent. The final image reweights the world’s logic without resorting to coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: motifs and transmissions intensify toward a closure where her song alters the field (followers’ doubts return; the prophet flickers). Orientation is clear early (observatory, exile, storm) and remains stable. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise, with a discernible before/after. The cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: gathering sounds → child’s request → opening the box → speaking jars into it → holographic closure. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: “We are still becoming” reweights the premise, with the cost implied in emptying the jars and surrendering curated memory into a communal device. Causality is clean and object‑driven; no teleporting rules or late cheats. The price is more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene causal chain is clear: artifact cracking → shadows manifest → sonic attempt → moral trade‑off → inventive reconfiguration that lands on the page. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (key abraded, emotional toll, implied future duty). Orientation is clean from the first line, and the lens holds through to the final spiral image. No unearned turns or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive is clean: pattern‑tracking → anomaly → spiral focal point → timed act. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (compass surrender, village signals, viaduct sparks), reading as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the price of not acting “a breath too soon” is integrated as the key narrowing. Offstage political outcomes are implied without weakening the on‑page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: descent → alcove → tallies → hidden journal → personal tie → decision. Orientation is firm early; the single‑scene investigation tightens logically around the discovery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (choosing to speak truth beyond data), with a felt cost implied by the father tie. The father reveal is abrupt but plausible and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: second opinion sought → partial revival of the heart → revelation of alternate evidence → decision to involve a journalist and rush the music box to Rowan. Orientation is strong from the first lines (shop, rain, skylight, stakes by dawn). Closure reads as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with concrete costs (risk, money, moral burden) and reweighted options. Nothing resolves the execution, but meaning and tactics decisively shift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑POV, clean orientation, and a tight accumulative build pay off in a conceptual repricing: the bell needs a translator, not a clapper. The causal chain holds (kaleidoscope → code → Algorithm → “Descend” → solution), and closure lands on the page with a felt price (risk of acid, dulled tool, bodily after‑ring). Stakes are intimate rather than perilous, keeping this just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is strong: anomalous hashtag → patch chord → map → infiltration → bargain → broadcast. The closure lands on the page with a decisive cost (losing identity/employment) and a clear after-state (becoming a living archive). Minor plausibility leaps (audio-to-map, AI conspiracy dump) are carried by the established world logic and do not disrupt the drive lens. The final blank-user cadence seals conceptual repricing cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: shard → mirror vision → improvised spear → ladder descent → net haul → on‑page rescue. Orientation is established early (who/where/when) and held without confusion. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost and a reweighted final beat. The motif of the “weighted breath before reply” coheres as a ticking frame rather than a gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: the horn’s call, the boy’s misrecognition, the chime, and the offering of tea build toward a reweighted stance on endings. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (hinge over delay) with cost visible on the page (relinquishing the heirloom and original plan). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the mosaic coda coheres under the same lens. No causality breaks; each image earns its place in the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive toward a resonant reconfiguration: staying reframed as pilgrimage, the letter as wisdom. Cues of who/where/when are clean, and the pattern of vineyard parallels is taught early and held. However, the final line truncates mid‑sentence, blunting the closure cadence and the cost’s felt landing. Even so, the decision to graft tomorrow and the reweighting of the letter furnish a workable, if softened, closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: search → manifestation → consecration → stabilization by dawn. Orientation lands early; the ritual procedures and the pavilion’s responses maintain causal coherence. Closure is on‑page and legible, with a before/after (echo threatened vs. stabilized) and a visible price in discipline/vulnerability. The beat structure is tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual actions (arranging arcs, the key, whispers) build to a communal witnessing and the town’s exhale—an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the start; the scene coheres in one window. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (labor, patience) rather than a sharp trade-off, which trims the apex. Still, the before/after cadence shift is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: hush → sequences → testimony → book/flower → “zygote.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she chooses witnessing over definition with a felt conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words; the crystal and dictionary motifs pay off on the page. The only limit is the low-friction path—escalation is elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: preparation (markers) → search through fog → discovery → listening → reweighting at closure. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when) and never lost. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: the realization that he becomes the sound, under the ongoing price of forgetting. Causal threads are subtle but consistent (markers enable finding; tape enables hearing; amnesia frames cost).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: tremors → clock hand in camera → shutter-click → collapse into the photograph → departure. Closure lands on the page with cost: the observatory is gone, fixed in the single frame, and Mira leaves. Setups (observatory-as-camera, spinning hand, leaf-sound) pay off causally and conceptually. Orientation is clear from the outset and serves the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece deepens via sensory braiding (sound → scent) toward on‑page closure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “reunify does not mean repair,” crystallized by rejoining the vinyl halves, with death and continued carrying as cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the two‑shard skybridge coda coheres. Setups (song title, shard) pay off precisely at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Strong causal chain: discovery of the key → activation of automaton → Möbius dome → encounter with detached shadow → transfer of the key → world-level reattachment of shadows. Orientation and rules are taught by objects and action; the drive lens holds through a decisive change with cost. Closure is on-page and unambiguous, with the price stamped into the final beats (her trade and the sealed loop). No major set-up is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present‑scene quest → path → sundial → invitation → tooth‑setting → dawn repricing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she chooses to live by a new rule that accepts fracture, with cost tethered to her frozen‑hour verdict and village implications. Orientation is clear early; causal ellipses feel magical but coherent. The tightening is modest yet purposeful and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → mist response → droplet strike → pearl → weighing → dispersion → dissolution forms a tight because/therefore chain within the story’s magical logic. Orientation is clean immediately (who/where/goal) and closure lands on the page with cost (pearl dissolves; sea glass dulls). The mirror’s cracking and dispersion into the village provide a concrete, climactic turn. No causality breaks or unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene with clean anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive, culminating in a Charged Poise closure (the burial under the server). Beats link plausibly: viral confession → sanctuary seeking → encounter → second recording → burial. The cost—refusing virality’s immediate release—lands on the page. No orientation debt; pattern and cadence are taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative design teaches its pattern early (cameos arriving to be acknowledged/collected) and pays it off with a resonant, on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; causality holds within the magical premise. Closure lands with visible cost: she relinquishes the curated hopes to gain courage and then enacts the change by writing through dawn. The shell’s lighthouse transformation is a coherent, consequential hinge rather than a convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative drive tightens toward the moment of release; setup → song → bloom → harvest → release reads cleanly. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual repricing: the remedy disperses and the valley’s voices return, with the vine’s withering and centuries’ grief as cost. Orientation is strong from the opening and the internal rules stay consistent. A slight didactic tilt in the final lines doesn’t undercut the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patience, patterning, then a single star catalyzes an earned intensification. Causality holds cleanly up to “the final ingredient was not more starlight but relinquishment.” However, on‑page closure is incomplete (“With steady fingers she tore the storybook” cuts off mid‑act), leaving the cost unlanded. Without the act’s completion, the before/after remains implied rather than made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative pressure leading to a clean on‑page turn: feeding silence backward restores time. Closure lands with cost—he seals the device, keeps the key singular—and the world reconfigures (villages’ clocks resume). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causal steps (study → pattern match → reverse assembly → release) are legible. The persistent constraint of the sealed, non‑reflective plate charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual → resistance (silence tightens, flame falters) → confession → violet flare → opening. Closure lands with cost on the page (finger cut, blood to wick) and a decisive reconfiguration (space unfolds, valley settles). Persistent constraint (heat to keep walls from seizing) shapes tactics and the final image (lamp left as a sun). No causality gaps; each beat escalates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: carving and object‑returns deepen pressure toward a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she repositions the latch, sets the carving for morning light, and reframes memory as both cage and key—with clear emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; no causality breaks. The live constraint of grief and the “kettle” clock shape the cadence without needing overt plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with dominant causal spine: each payment (fragments → 1998 → 2015 → blank) tightens options and leads to the decisive exchange. Closure lands on-page with cost as the blank develops into a mirror and the ghost becomes the narrator, inverting identities. Orientation is taught early and the surreal rules stay consistent. The price is explicit: erased years, ambition loss, and ontological displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean accumulative structure moving from exploration to reactivation to public signal, culminating in a conceptually reweighted terminal (farewell → welcome). Because/therefore linkages are intact (sextant → manifold → beacons → REFUGE). Closure lands on the page; cost is modest but legible (labor, relinquishing the tool, departing unseen). The drive lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: ritual acts escalate toward an Earned Stasis/CR closure where she foregoes the chronometer and plants the seed. Orientation is established early; the causal chain—bear placement → rain lens → revelation → crack/seed → planting—lands with cost. The epilogue image of the linden reinforces the on‑page choice without softening it. No major structural debts or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: sundial/gnomon dent → log discrepancies → scratched coordinate → beached barge → recovered journals → decisive mission shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: she relinquishes the sundial and redirects her life’s vector with visible cost (loss of father-myth). Orientation is strong from the opening image; the drive lens holds. The final mission toward statues extends consequence rather than soft-resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: decoding → intrusion → chime → bead crack → planting → escape → dawn reprise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a seed sprouts through the dock, conceptually reweighting “heritage” with on‑page cost (sacrificing artifact, risk of confiscation). Orientation is clean from the first line. The chime completing the stanza leans slightly convenient but doesn’t undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thread shortens, presences surface, self appears, and she plants the final inch. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis—she gives up the tool and role, empties the notebook, and reenters the world changed. Cost is legible on the page (“notebook empty... work complete”), and orientation is clean from the outset. The beat‑to‑beat because/therefore chain is lyrical but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture riding a causal chain: assembling components → hatching crack → ribbon aria → world reconfiguration → palace’s fall. Closure lands on the page with cost (chains snapping, descent into dark) and a clear before/after repricing (“flawed genesis is still genesis”). Orientation is clean early and remains legible through the lyric. No teleports or patchwork; set‑ups (egg warmth, wire hum, necropolis music) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration: the ritual concludes with a charged promise to bring saplings next year. Anchors are clear by the first sentence; backstory is cued by present stimuli and alters the present tactically. Closure carries cost—she plants “his shame” with her compassion and accepts the ongoing watch. The lens holds and the final image reweights prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the breadcrumb sequence tightens from First Lies → Last Goodbyes → Unkept Promises → Forgiveness. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: she opens the box, releases memories, leaves the vessel, and time resumes (geese in motion). Cost is legible (she relinquishes the anchor-object and her defensive stance). The pattern is taught early and coheres through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: sonar pulses, pattern data, echo → beacon → activation → garden’s reconfiguration. Causality is legible: the new echo triggers pursuit, the beacon enables “light without fire,” and the gear’s ratio resolves into rhythm. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual cost (breaking the family pattern; relinquishing the heirloom). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/what), with no teleports or rule breaches.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers ritual acts toward a reweighted spiral/mentorship premise culminating in the gravestone and seedlings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—collective grief gains an embodied pattern given away to the living. However, the final sentence truncates mid‑cadence (“into”), slightly blurring the landing even though an earlier closure beat (families weeping at the spiral) already works. Causality within the lyric frame remains coherent with clean because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens toward the heartbeat pause and pays off with a decisive modification of the mechanism and a reweighted world-rule for time/debt. Causality is clean: carving the “r” → lashing the rake handle → slowed beat → villagers emerge → social and physical cadence shift. The closure carries cost and a persistent constraint (the altered pendulum and corrosion). Orientation is clear from the opening and supports the payoff image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear because/therefore chain: coin → cipher → drawer → map → targeted dig → descent and sealing. Closure lands on the page with cost: she shuts herself below as the surface locks, assuming a charged, altered role. The causal thread holds without teleporting props, and set‑ups (chess clock, spiral, tapestry) pay off. Minor softness: the puzzle solves smoothly, reducing felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the humming spire, the dawn clock, the ear‑to‑apex listening, and the memory‑for‑stroke exchange tighten coherently. Closure lands on the page with cost as she becomes the constraint and the quill dissolves into her palm. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/when) and feeds the ending image (hairline crack/question mark). No causality breaks; the price and rule‑set remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: nights of preparation lead causally to the solstice broadcast. Closure lands on the page when the inspectors inhale the chord and the city begins to “recall” stories, with conceptual cost to the regime. Orientation is clean by the first lines and the pattern pays off at the ending image. The one‑shot window (solstice, receivers calibrated for silence) tightens options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and actions accrue toward a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing at the final spiral. Orientation is clear early, and each beat (chair at vanishing point → mask → powder spiral) coheres causally in this mode. Closure lands via the final image reweighting the premise with felt cost. Slightly static midsection cadence keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: each dive, ledger, and strata map tightens toward the burial sump and the creation/deposition of the counter‑narrative. Closure lands via a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she sets a new “clock” in lead and bone, then confronts the city with a stance at sunrise with visible social cost. Orientation is strong from the opening image; no causality breaks. Minor: the public moment’s stakes could sharpen further with one concrete consequence threatened or triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: listening → collecting syllables → recognition of missing root → sacrifice → city-wide reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early and the equinox window provides an implicit clock. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she never sings again; the rosette crumbles; her silence re-tunes the city. Cost is on-page and reshapes options post-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal spine under an accumulative/lyric mode: theft → timed planting → pruning aromas altering the city → transformative dawn → Ministry’s muted arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the greenhouse and the city’s palate are reweighted; officers leave with seeds. The ticking clock and environmental filter (“loudspeakers” softened by chlorophyll) anchor time and place. Cost is legible via risk, blood, and the decision to vanish rather than claim victory.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: riddle → ascent → second riddle → forced lie → lightning → reanimated hive → toll renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (risking job/identity and opening the gate). Orientation is strong from the first line, and the drive lens holds. Minor reliance on riddle-convenience never breaks logic.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the house’s “daydream” hum stacks to the realization of loneliness for choreography, then to the ritual that quiets it. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise): the cottage settles, the shard is embedded, options reweighted. Causal threads between orris, displacement, and the stop of vibration are legible and motivated. The cost is subtle rather than acute, which keeps it just shy of the uppermost band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal/accumulative: awakening → discovery of ampoule → approach to structural weakness → deliberate break with explicit cost. Orientation is immediate and coherent; the keystone method pays off a clear setup. Closure lands on page with a reweighted world—statues awaken, certainty dissolves—and the price is acknowledged (betrayal of former duty, irreversible change). The final charged poise (waiting for divers) crystallizes new stakes without handwaving.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of climb → dice → mathematical interventions → ripple → renunciation → forgetting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she chooses not to step through; the world begins to forget her). Orientation is clear from the outset and the rules evolve consistently (perpetual motion, then its falter on recognition). The set‑ups (dice, proof, sigma) all pay off causally within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: moon, brush, breath, and city-kindness build to a resonant reconfiguration where the mural becomes communal respiration. Closure lands on the page with cost—four nights of insomnia and an on‑page earned stasis (she finally sleeps) while the city carries the price and promise of remembering. Orientation anchors early and remains clean, and the rule-set (moon/ink/greenhouse) is consistent. The persistent constraint of night/moon shapes tactics and the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: confiscated hives → repurposed lens → signal travels → artisans return → Council confrontation → atelier future. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “rescue is resonance,” with social cost implied (partial repopulation, ongoing resistance). Orientation is strong early; a minor truncation of the final sentence slightly scuffs the landing but not the closure already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage is tight: lighthouse → yoyo → murals → iterative tricks → gear reveal → coupling with the stone → cut of the string → reset before the judges. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the drive lens stays causal through closure. Closure lands on‑page with cost: he lives but loses his unique craft, and the spent stone concretizes the price. No unkept setups; the earlier prophecy image (falling on steps) is consciously rejected in the fold leap.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid but Accumulative‑dominant structure coheres: corridor → mirror child → offering of paradox and clasp yields a charged reconfiguration. Setups pay off (clasp, cursed booth, dictionary) and the sequence tightens options with each beat. Closure lands on the page with cost (letting the mirrors collapse and relinquishing the clasp). The rule‑set’s dream logic is taught early enough to avoid causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sound-making escalates from solitary study to communal dubbing to engineered spiral, culminating in movement across the Doldrum Wall. Orientation is clean from the outset, and each tactic logically arises from prior signals (cloud lyre → nautilus spiral → rotating crown). Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after: stillness to motion, silence to groove. The persistent constraint (dead calm) shapes all tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: tremor match → altered note → watchers stir → turtles veer → question → crack‑vision answer → city reorients. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (the gate’s true purpose) and an on‑page turn (the city turning back). Orientation is solid from the opening; the drive lens remains coherent. The reveal is swift but earned by the patterned communication tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: arrival → recovery of the letter → intrusion of the watchman → tactical escape → reweighted commitment. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the rose‑clock teaches pattern early enough. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing—the final image reconfigures the chronicle’s authority with a legible future cost. No causality breaks or unkept setups; the single scene sustains pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: a ritual sequence intensifies toward writing directly on the stone and a final conceptual repricing (“every separation…a kind of foundation”). Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—she seals the notes, closes the inkwell lighter, and walks away. The engineers’ report frame sets stakes but remains ambient, leaving the causal line of external risk underused. Still, the on‑page cost is felt in the renunciation and secret inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean single‑scene structure with because/therefore links: blackout → stamp’s unscrambling → bruise‑pattern reading → darkness test → city‑grid reveal → new indexing decision. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing; the story’s premise is reweighted (origin = erasure) and tactics shift accordingly. The cost remains conceptual rather than concretely jeopardizing her—effective but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned progression from approach → descent/ascension → ritual → release → return. Closure lands cleanly with cost: the moonstone crumbles, engines darken, her last spark is spent, and the cranes become lanterns for others; this reconfigures options in a felt way. Orientation is clear early, and the basilica/tea garden rules are consistent. The final image serves a Resonant Reconfiguration with a tangible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: geode → mapping potential → deliberate perturbations → accelerated harvesting → final jump that realigns the telescope and diverts a strike. Orientation is swift and stable; the clock (“circuit breakers cooling”) shapes tactics and the ending. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with legible cost (his death) and a charged final image. No teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene causal spine is clean: arrival → invitation → lever pull → printed star‑map → reconfiguration. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the stars “sing her name,” narrowing options toward the choice to follow. Cost is implied (foreclosing the searcher identity for the path found), but it’s gentle. Lens holds as accumulative with a causal apex at the press.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs and acts (driftwood, powder, watch hand, sea) tighten toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first line; the single-scene arc coheres. Closure lands on the page with cost when she speaks the brother’s name and releases the object. A hairline slip is the truncated final word, which slightly mars the cadence but not the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene structure accrues pressure with ritualized moves toward a resonant closure (RR/CR): the exchange completes without signatures, the object is ceded, and “forgiveness as space” reframes the premise. The situational/accumulative lens holds: moon‑timing, mist, and protocol shape tactics and outcome. Cost is legible on the page and binds to the final image. Causality is elliptical yet coherent; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly from launch through fog to the charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the compass’s “recalibration” shifts the rule‑set from metal to marrow, with the open sea as a priced yes. Orientation is clear from the outset, and set pieces (wake, shoals, fog, shipping channel) accrue coherently. The cost is legible on the page: risk, injury, and surrender of prior mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: newspapers → coordinates → lake → bargain → immersion → return. Closure is on‑page and costly: he consents to absorb pain and reorients his life (Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing via the turnstile/redemption frame). Setups (baseball, obituaries, ward) pay off in the final images (soldered ball, non‑bleeding obits, letters). The cost is legible in the “borrowed rhythms” heartbeat and the ongoing ladder of letters.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: omen → ritual prep → shadow-sister → realization of price → merger → phoenix surrender. Orientation is swift and legible within the first lines (orchard, moon, phoenix-sister). Closure is a decisive change with felt cost, and the lens holds through ritual causality with lyric accumulation. Persistent constraints (only what remains unburned can guide the burned) shape tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and ritual actions escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration (the crack detaches, strikes her chest, and time rushes back). Orientation is taught early and the pattern pays off in the closure image at 3:42 a.m. Cost is legible on the page—the relinquishing of “the clasp of grief” and the permanent reweighting of her relationship to time and loss. The final act (speaking the name, offering repentance) closes the causal arc with a felt before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural drive holds: photos → sail → buoyancy → bruise corridor → threshold → stay. Closure is on‑page and felt via a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship becomes seed/lantern and Halcyon forecloses return. Causality is clean within the chosen metaphysics; the only ding is that the cost, while present, remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush → synchronization → staged release → reweighted identity. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (she trades memories and “where her heart used to be” for the hush). Orientation is immediate and clean; the final image coheres with set motifs. Minor over-explanation slightly blunts the silence’s earned charge.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → sundial code → infiltration → seed‑light → Voss interruption → misdirection → chain‑room transfer → barges free → dawn reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with the barges drifting and the fort “unlocked,” a decisive before/after. The cost is conceptual (identity risk, institutional betrayal, live danger) rather than bodily, but it’s felt in the mask removal and the deception scene. Orientation is precise from the start; lens reads primarily causal with lyric inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rock placements → star dust singing → eel‑constellation culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (tidal bluff, frictionless world, night aurora), and closure lands with a visible conceptual price (witnessing over understanding; eel dissolves). The curse’s momentary lift creates the decisive now. A stronger on‑page impediment would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative structure is coherent: storm → darkroom ritual → revelation of scars as a map → emissary plane → acceptance. Closure manifests as a resonant reconfiguration where scars become belonging. Slight deduction for the truncated final word, which mars cadence at the landing beat, though prior closure moves have already settled. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early and consistently carried.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with a coherent accumulative/textural drive builds to a clean closure: he removes the vocoder and they step into the brook together. The sundial’s arc functions as a patterned cadence that pays off at the end. Cost is legible (public vulnerability, surrendering the adversarial stance). Orientation is crisp from the opening line; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens (causal with textural accrual): the patrol’s approach → Rourke’s entry → their bluff forms a clean tightening, while motifs (tin, skins, spiral) accumulate toward a reconfigured end. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lark names a new identity and they secure a plausible institutional shield for the library. The brief foretold future (“No bulldozer will arrive…”) slightly reduces on‑page price, but does not break closure. Orientation is clear from the first lines and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: each surreal turn follows motivated discovery (hatch → arbor → film loop) and culminates in a charged renunciation. Closure is on‑page Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she ends the chord, leaves the loop, accepts cost. The traded sound functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is taught early and remains legible; cost is explicit in the relinquished refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: investigation → dream entry → discovery of fissure → seed trade → instructions → communal repair → tested by monsoon. Closure lands on-page with cost and effect: the ridge holds and she loses the mentor’s name; both are visible in action and image. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric accumulation supporting, and holds to the end. Orientation is established early; no teleports or rule-breaking fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: compass → lace map → dyed proof → crossing → offering, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration on the dock. Closure lands on the page with cost and a before/after: he reframes severance and returns under a new stance. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set‑ups (lace instructions, compass quiver) pay off. The single scene transition is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.7)
    The structure is flawless for this length, operating on a tight causal chain that holds under its hybrid lens. The closure is masterful, delivering both a Decisive Change (the ridge is saved) and a profound Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of memory and truth is re-framed) with a clearly legible on-page cost ("her mind hollow where a mentor’s name had been").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through the layering of symbolic meaning rather than external events. The two-shard structure (islet to mainland) is clean and effective. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where "the apology is this" (the lace), and exile is reframed as "pruning." The cost is made tangible by his choice to leave the tree and compass behind, renouncing his solitary practice to re-engage with the community.
