  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Marina, canyon, post-arson) and maintains a causal through-line: ledger reveals uranium truth, which reframes her father's glow and her own artistic failure, prompting the choice to warn suppliers and abandon her identity. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina walks into the canyon with new purpose, the world believing her dead, options reweighted with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger's contents shift her understanding from artistic failure to moral imperative. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (frost patterns, glass motifs); it holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift (conservatory, Arctic, three months post-accident, alone). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira builds a thermal dictionary through the night, culminating in the realization that she "hadn't lost music at all" but learned its secret language—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her deafness. Cost is conceptual (crewmates frozen, her own transformation) but legible in the final image of thermal symphony and frozen tears. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery that plants compose via heat) though it feels more like revelation than a choice-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens early (package → descent → library → transformation) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the timeline is legible. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas chooses to remain as undertaker-guardian, forecloses his surface life, and the library achieves rest. However, the cost is more asserted ("his mortuary stood empty") than felt in the moment of decision; the final beats summarize rather than dramatize the renunciation, weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the midnight bell ritual accretes participation across six months, deepening communal bonds through patterned acts. The closure—Marta ringing the bell one final time before others take her place, followed by the council announcement—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: her withdrawal after achieving saturation). Cost is conceptual (her anonymity preserved, her labor transferred) but legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early (arbor, ridge, settlement, sanctions context). One minor slip: the officials' arrival introduces a micro-reversal that deflates immediately without altering Marta's trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: sparks → ghost → tear → door → offering. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Mae, viaduct, twilight, post-memory timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mae realizes she must give rather than take, constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, cost at closure is conceptual and diffuse—"empty and full simultaneously" asserts rather than dramatizes the price of releasing her photographs. The gap between stated transformation and on-page felt consequence keeps this mid-band despite structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt at closure. Orientation is present early (hedge maze designer, living bridge garden, halo fragment). The ending offers a conceptual repricing—time as mutable, Elara as gardener—but the cost remains abstract; no specific option is foreclosed on the page, no concrete price paid. The fragment's disintegration happens to her rather than through her choice, weakening agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (carnival captive, redemption center). Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative texture (piano-key decoding, seed scattering). Closure is a Decisive Change (chain snaps, Marcus leaves with seeds) but the cost is conceptual and future-oriented rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path in the final beat, only promise. The piano-key GPS sequence feels like a puzzle insert rather than organically discovered pressure; it arrives and solves without prior setup or failed attempt. One meaningful tightening (chain breaks) but the stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (greenhouse, Elena, night) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered metaphor (cells dividing, absence imprinting, trust as frequency) and the final image reweights the opening question with conceptual cost—Elena hears "it all" where her grandfather heard only half. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures the premise with felt recognition. However, the causal linkage between the forge process and the final auditory revelation remains somewhat opaque; the mechanics of "imprinting absence" are more poetic gesture than dramatized method, weakening the cost legibility by a half-step.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (situational-accumulative) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Cassia's stance crystallizes around "truth is more beautiful than the lie"—with conceptual cost legible in the mother's relief and the recurring moonbeam motif. The causal chain from client request to portrait analysis to revelation is clean, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Marina's installation transforms the control room and the couple's arrival crystallizes the space's new function with felt cost implicit in her years of displacement. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines (who/where/when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the couple asks "Is it safe?" and Marina's response reweights her solitary work into active service. The cost—her abandoned prestigious studio and the weight of returning—is legible but somewhat diffused across reflection rather than concentrated at the ending beat, limiting the closure's punch.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is established early (library, Marcus, post-discovery timeframe), and a closure effect lands: Jake collapses under transferred fears while Marcus walks out transformed. However, the causal chain relies heavily on off-page work ("spent the drive here decrypting") and convenience (the child's cast contains exactly the reversal formulas needed). The because/therefore linkage frays: why does touching the shell halves activate Jake's fears when Marcus has "already reversed their resonance"? The closure image—Marcus pocketing the whole shell and leaving—provides Decisive Change, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; we don't feel what Marcus sacrifices or what path he forecloses by walking away still a stunt double.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and image (storm, star, booklet, darkness catalogues) and resolves through a cadence shift—the oracle's acceptance that mapping endless night is process, not destination. This Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with reflective repricing) does reweight the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual (patience over completion) but the final image of the waiting page is legible. Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying the lens, though the turn feels contemplative rather than causally compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors efficiently: Unit-7739, frozen courtyard, post-procedure. The story employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the seventeen-timeline perception, the ice-violin discovery, and the realization about consciousness emerging from gaps. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the premise (where thoughts come from) without a physical decisive change. The cost reads conceptual (understanding replaces mystery) rather than felt in a choice that forecloses options, keeping the closure in the RR/CR zone but not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: confessions layer toward reconciliation, the lens stays coherent, and forecourt acoustics deepen throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the hand-taking and shared understanding reweight mistrust into tentative trust with felt cost ("simply two people learning to trust again"). Orientation is clean by opening paragraph. The escalation is modest—one accumulative deepening via parallel confessions—but sufficient at this length and the cost (months of silence, protective deceptions now transparent) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when early (Marta, garden maze, post-Ministry era). Pressure accumulates through layered acts of defiance (drought of '31, dying rose, Ministry inspector visit) and culminates in the marble handoff, which reweights the dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—by extending that knowledge to a new generation. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marta's own luck index shifts "not the measured kind, but the real kind," crystallizing her life's work in the act of transmission. The cost is conceptual and felt: she gives away her newest, sharpest marble, and tomorrow she will add another loop, signaling ongoing labor rather than rest.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through escalating sensory paradoxes ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm") and temporal imagery. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Ira's realization that "time moved sideways" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—her colleagues will dismiss it, isolating her discovery. However, orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words), warranting a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0. The reweighting feels philosophical rather than materially consequential on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens with accumulative pressure building through the water-revealed notation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when anchored promptly). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed note and dual-signed program, but the cost is unclear—Marcus suffers no visible loss or foreclosed path. The "perfectly dry" restoration and simultaneous dating feel like reward rather than reconfiguration with cost. The causality of the ghost orchestra appearing, playing, then vanishing lacks consequence that alters Marcus's options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (fever → illustration → flowers → drawing) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final act of smudging and taping the drawing crystallizes her stance—she'll carry marginal truth down the mountain, protecting what official knowledge can't reach. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening paragraphs). One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees the flowers bloom under aurora light, transforming her understanding from fever-glimpse to embodied knowledge. Cost is visible: she files a false report, accepts marginality, and carries the weight "like a second, wiser heart."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus photographs without claiming, leaving the valve wheel "in the space between confession and absolution"—a renunciation that forecloses appropriation with felt cost (he carries "the weight of that swallowed truth"). The accumulative lens is taught early through radio fragments and held; each confession deepens pressure until Marcus understands his role as witness rather than finder. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line two). One tightening: the radio caller's live confession narrows Marcus's mission from documentation to moral appraisal, reweighting his descent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: moss-words-swan-river images recur, but no single moment crystallizes a before/after with legible cost. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, waiving the test. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing ("she had become what she documented"), yet this insight is asserted rather than demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior material—no visible or felt price appears on the page. One tightening occurs when explorers arrive, but their departure leaves no trace, flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the curl, lullabies, and eclipse converge in a ritual that reweights past and present. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the release of the curl and the shared hum crystallize lifelong nurture into a transferable legacy. Cost is somewhat soft: the curl is "gone" but its purpose is "fulfilled," which reads more as satisfaction than foreclosure. Orientation is clean (Elena, Sofia, Sage Ridge, eclipse day anchored early), and the eclipse countdown provides a tightening frame, but the middle meanders through nested backstory without a clear tightening choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly in opening lines. The story accumulates density through layered discoveries (tapestry → diary → child's drawing → wall-whispers), building to a conceptual repricing where Thrain understands her role as tender of the echo and the axis displacement cycle. The closure reconfigures her isolation from abandonment to necessary function. Cost is conceptual (she is left behind, will wait through cycles) but felt in "bronze quiet" and "patient as stone." One modest friction: the escalation is primarily cognitive accretion rather than narrowing choice, which fits the lens but mutes urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Chen, tavern, post-midnight) and a coherent stake (orchestrating his own disappearance). However, the closure relies heavily on conceptual assertion ("finally understanding") rather than a decisive on-page act with visible cost. The walk toward the lighthouse and the found objects tomorrow function as RR (Charged Poise), but the cost remains implied rather than felt in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens is signaled but not taught early; the ending reconfigures meaning conceptually without a clear before/after pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, one continuous scene in the cathedral; who/where/when anchor by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's assumption-possession dissolves, Marcus completes "transformation of stillness from prison to possibility") with conceptual cost legible on the page: she must now inhabit her own assumptions rather than be inhabited. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (loops build architecture, indigo bleeds meaning, silence decorates). One meaningful deepening: the rhetorical spiral unravels the demon. However, the seventeen-minute timeframe is declared but never tracked; the palette "trembles" and "clatters" without clear causal linkage to Marcus's loop-pedal work, creating a micro-causality gap that doesn't break closure but softens its inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early (glass spire, frozen lake, Mei). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fortune slips spiral, dawn intensifies, symphonies converge in a final image. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "chronologically home at last"), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible—what path does she foreclose, what does she lose by conducting? The ending reweights prior motifs but the price paid is conceptual, not visceral or social.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal elements) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words, though "when" remains elusive beyond "after rain." The closure—Kira integrating fractured selves and touching down—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to embodied wholeness), and the tablet's crumbling signals cost. However, the cost reads more conceptual than felt: we don't see what she loses by collapsing timelines, only what she gains. The procedural-generation conceit creates escalation through visual cycling but the escalation mechanism (viaduct reconfiguring) doesn't narrow her options or force trade-offs until the final rune press.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Lucia), where (cavern), and what (seeking connection through vibration) anchor by the second paragraph. The accumulative lens holds—reversed music layering sensations until emotional thawing occurs. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: "silence, properly invited, could enthrall" reweights her relationship to deafness. However, the cost remains abstract and felt rather than visibly foreclosing an option on the page. No concrete choice or renunciation crystallizes; the phonograph simply winds down and she walks home changed. The ending reconfigures meaning but the price paid is conceptual, not dramatized in a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena's final act of sending the message and returning to her instruments crystallizes her shift from passive observer to active participant, with the cost legible in "each measurement she took now was both a meditation and an act of resistance." The piece operates under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening (the pigeon's arrival and message reframe twenty years of ignored data as suppressed intelligence). Orientation is clean within the first 120 words (who/where/when established). The linkage from follower → message → decision → reply is motivated throughout, with no causality breaks. Weakness: the northern breach setup and storm-seeding revelation arrive primarily through exposition rather than dramatized discovery, which slightly softens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a series of revelations (Samuel, Thomas, the daughter) but no causal chain—each layer is passively received rather than earned through Marcus's agency. Closure reads as a thematic statement ("texture of time") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses options with visible cost. The orientation test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization coheres at the ending. The rope replacement gesture carries no legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the chronic hush transforms into "a quietude that held space for the incomplete" with visible cost (the forest is gone, polished performance replaced by imperfect music). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered motifs (ash, water, shipwrecks, the bowl filling with non-monetary offerings). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One micro turn when the child and accordion player arrive deepens the pressure without requiring multiple reversals. Cost is legible in the line "The rainforest would not return, but from its ashes, something else was growing."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is swift and clear (grotto, dusk, Vera's profession). The dominant stake—harvesting half-truths before the grotto seals—drives the middle beats, and the time constraint (transformation completing at dusk) tightens pressure. However, closure is a walkaway: Vera exits with her harvest intact, no decisive change or visible cost on the page. The final image ("carrying her harvest of incomplete truths, each one a small mercy") asserts thematic resonance but does not reconfigure options or enact a felt price. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in method but delivers summary instead of a charged final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The structure follows a causal through-line: misdirected letter → Margot's investigation → Martha reconciliation → library involvement. However, the climax—Margot receiving the thank-you photo—feels more like validation than closure with cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The final paragraph's "understanding finally" pivot reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive change or renunciation that alters Margot's stakes. Cost is implied (time, effort) but not made visceral in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images of weaving, tags, kinship) but the closure unit—finding the artist and "completing" the arbor—is a delivered discovery rather than a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is clean early (crater, arbor, Kira's arrival), but the seven-night search montage compresses all reversals into summary ("became ritual," "slowly revealed a pattern") and the climactic descent is communal consensus, not Kira's constrained choice. The story teaches a pattern of accretion but pays it off with a tidy reunion that resets all exile rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Closure is a Decisive Change—Marina uncages the extinct creatures and breaks the city's borrowed-time system—with felt cost (cracked pendant, sculptors' panic, Morteus waking). The chamber discovery and drawing-completion sequence form a clean because/therefore chain. The ending reweights prior material (illustrations shift from frozen to complete), though the cost to Marina personally remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by the carved steps). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Morrow leaves the eyes on the mosaic and commits to return, crystallizing her stance toward loss. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no tactic is foreclosed, no relationship altered. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of glass eyes, mosaic chips, fungal rings building to a reweighted understanding), but the final image restates theme ("mathematics of emotion...always balanced") rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (placing the eyes reveals Elias), yet the turn feels convenient: the eyes unlock exactly what she sought without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Edgar's realization that "becoming visible wasn't about emerging from the shadows" but about "trust—the careful exchange of gifts" reconfigures the thirty-seven-year isolation with visible cost (he will leave the fragments tomorrow). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the pattern of cache-giving deepens when we learn the archivist has been mirroring it, creating a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The orientation anchors (crawl space, library, dawn outage) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist reveals she knows he's there and has been leaving the tape player as invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Marcus, nursery trellis, storm season); the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with steady density increase toward the final image of Marcus "no longer fully human, no longer fully plant." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): he stops studying and begins becoming, forecloses his human certainty with visible cost (the merged leaf, his transformed perception). One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf merges and his perception shifts. The cost is felt but slightly abstract; the exact trade-off—what he loses by crossing the threshold—could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's steady hands and commitment to paint "until the water was gone" reweights her exhaustion into purposeful endurance with visible cost (the water will be consumed, the brooch is gone). Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each element (causeway timing, brooch history, jar's origin) layers to charge the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The rain-trail navigation creates spatial coherence and a ticking constraint (three hours) that pressures the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (clairvoyant in cave following pearl's pull) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera's sight is transformed, and the dissolving pearl marks irreversible change. However, the closure lacks felt cost—she gains expanded awareness without losing anything on the page. The narrative follows an Accumulative lens (textural density building to conceptual shift), but the shadow-presence's exposition replaces causal pressure with explanation. The pilgrim's reappearance at the cave mouth feels convenient rather than earned, and Vera's passivity (receiving lessons rather than wrestling with choices) undercuts the transformation's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kessa's archive work layers meaning through staggered intervals and fragment compilation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—turning the valve "one final time" to produce "a mechanical sigh"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the community's dual state of presence/absence, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a specific forfeiture. The anniversary opening reweights prior accumulation but doesn't narrow options through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear Drive Lens (Accumulative/Textural: crack-arrows accumulate into a route, culminating in the fortress) and delivers a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the punch validates "passage between what is admitted and what is known," reweighting the arrows' meaning. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~90 words. However, the closure image lacks visible cost: Elara "walks backward along the arrows" with "steady purpose" and promises to return "as many times as necessary," which reads as volitional exploration rather than a path foreclosed or a price paid. The mid-section tightening (mist thickens, districts shouldn't connect, final arrow at mist-wall) accumulates density, but the ending deflates pressure into iterative cataloging rather than a single decisive reweighting with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear by the opening lines (Elena, clifftop tower, dawn). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: whale songs, tile discovery, grandmother's marginalia, and transcription beats layer until the final image reweights Elena's skepticism. However, the closure effect—Elena's understanding and final transcription "of the space between certainty and wonder"—is asserted more than shown; the conceptual repricing reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive image or action with legible cost. The progression accumulates density but the ending pivot into integration feels soft, lacking a sharp before/after moment or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (magnetic imagery). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure—stepping through the door "beyond forever"—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: Vex has wanted escape for millennia, so the step costs nothing she valued. The causal chain (storm → masked approach → amulet fusion → door) is clear, but the "spatial mutiny" premise dissolves into background; the crew's revolutionary stakes vanish when the door simply opens to "something after goodbye" without resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page via Resonant Reconfiguration (Maya's final calculation "Everything") that reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the prep-room confrontation narrows options through Wei's decision to accept both offerings. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). One meaningful tightening occurs when Maya reveals the envelope's contents, altering Wei's stance. Minor causality slip: Wei's entrance feels under-motivated—how did he know to come now, three days after the father's death?

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stationer arrives, sets up instruments, records frequencies through the night, and closes at dawn with tea and a plan to return. One subtle tightening occurs as the lamp's hum "grew stronger" at dawn and she captures "another texture of time," but no decision narrows options or imposes visible cost. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"invented back into existence"—yet the cost remains abstract; we cannot point to a specific forfeited path or felt price on the page. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mari layers observations across tides until the congregation revelation crystallizes a charged poise moment. Orientation anchors cleanly (harbor, containers, Mari's legal death, tidal rhythm) by the opening paragraphs. The closure—signing multiple names in Container 47-B and recognizing her community of the erased—reconfigures her stake from solo collector to testifying witness with felt cost (accepting permanent namelessness, committing to return). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the fresh annotation and realizes others share her condition, which reweights her solitary purpose. Closure lands on the page under the accumulative lens with conceptual cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraphs. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: resonances build through shell, cello, and Claudia's explanation toward a final image of shared unfinished conversations. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Marina's choice to preserve rather than bust the myth), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page consequence or forfeited path is legible in the final beat. The turn from investigation to participation happens via dialogue-delivered insight rather than pressure-driven choice, weakening causal tightness even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid; closure reads as Decisive Change (reorganization enacted) with a micro Conceptual Repricing (laws as shield). Orientation anchors early (raft city, Maya, graffiti overnight). The escalation—graffiti warning → developers arrive → community meeting → incorporation plan → legal murals—advances causally with one meaningful tightening. Cost is present but muted: the stone chip finds a home, the carnival continues "protected," and Maya watches "knowing she had helped" without a felt price for her dual allegiance or a path foreclosed. The ending assertion "still floating, still free" tells resolution rather than showing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the vigil setup, chemical timer, and ice sublimation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Vera seals her habitat and leaves the hourglass—a refusal to abandon documentation that forecloses her presence with felt cost. The closure reweights prior material (humanity's retreat, the grain of sand, her solitary witness) through the final image of carrying only her camera. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands she's "documenting humanity's first retreat," narrowing her mission from scientific observation to historical witness. Cost is legible: she leaves the Moon, her work incomplete by bureaucratic standards, carrying only proof no one commissioned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a causal lens: Maya must repair the drone before the ship departs, creating a ticking clock. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the first paragraph). The closure—Maya releasing the drone and reflecting on finding her way—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; she succeeds fully with no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The repair itself is never in doubt, weakening the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (falcon, outpost, frozen lake) and follows a causal chain: empty message tube → chart work → condensation pattern discovery → inspector arrival → decision to share. The closure is a Charged Poise moment where Margot's choice to trust reconfigures her isolated obsession into shared risk, with the "held breath before a first spring thaw" image making the stakes legible. The cost is present but oblique—she risks her position and the research itself—though the exact price remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when she connects the phrasebook pattern to her condensation map.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (bell tuner, Millhaven, market square). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual repetition and the town's physical restoration. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (the town persists through shared rhythm after her departure), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page moment crystallizes what was sacrificed or risked. The "collapse" frame promises stakes ("three years before") but the threat never materializes as pressure; it functions as distant context rather than a ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors late: who/where/when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's metaphysical phrasing, though the underwater temple frame clarifies by ~150 words. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated encounters (visions, James floating, the sanctum)—but closure as Conceptual Repricing depends on whether "becoming part of the gathered hush" reweights the premise with legible cost. The final image ("inhaled the temple's water...becoming part of the gathered hush") offers transcendence but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture of her daughter or surface life in a decisive beat. Causality holds within its mystical logic, yet the ending reconfigures meaning more through declaration than on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: copper light, lattice imagery, and the confessional motif recur and the ending reweights the premise through testimony rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear (lighthouse prison, Marcus in cell, evening). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lattice becomes testament, truth displaces lie—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page. The supply boat's arrival and discovery are promised for "by morning," placing consequence off-stage. One meaningful deepening occurs (journal discovery → testimony), satisfying the lens, but the final image lacks visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost bride's dissipation into the environment, breaking the chain). Orientation is established early (greenhouse, winter-cracked fields, eternal night). The closure unit—her fading and the dawn's arrival—lands on the page with conceptual cost (freedom purchased by dissolution) and reweights the premise. The causal chain is mostly clean, though the ghost bride's agency dominates the final beat, limiting Marlow's decisive role. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bead cracks and releases compressed time, narrowing the story's options toward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (tide pools, petroglyphs, illustration plate), and the nautilus-spiral discovery at the three-moon mark offers a pattern break. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, closure lacks visible cost—Calla smiles, the children dance permanently, "the world was learning to breathe again"—delivering resonance through assertion rather than an on-page reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with felt price. The final paragraph summarizes future possibility instead of crystallizing present consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens that holds to closure: landscape details (orchard-cemetery, roots through tombs) accumulate pressure toward Miriam's final choice to map the wandering paths. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Miriam commits to "the work of rebuilding" with visible cost: "months" of labor, accepting "faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth." The cost is legible in the inscription "Time returns all wanderers to their purpose" and her kneeling gesture. One small slip: the transition from "The earthquake changed everything" to the present tomb excavation compresses three weeks of prior village work into summary, creating minor ellipsis friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through chalk ritual, client backstory, and postal-truck choreography, but no meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options or alters knowledge on the page. The ending offers continuity ("tomorrow she would return") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the final image restates the premise without reweighting it. No visible price is paid or path foreclosed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—Vera completes the final chart knowing the coup will begin tomorrow, her intelligence network activated with undeniable consequences ahead. The causal lens holds: each scene flows because/therefore from her embedded position to encoded intelligence to final transmission. Orientation anchors early (cobalt dome, Vera at work, officers visiting). One meaningful tightening occurs when Crane confirms "tomorrow night," crystallizing the timeline and raising immediacy. Cost is legible in the conceptual price: her disguise forecloses normal relationships, and the resistance will now act on her intelligence with lives at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (message sent via dreams, armor released) with felt cost: years of isolation ending, the shard crumbling, vulnerability chosen. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—spirits' songs, condensation windows, and the shard accumulate pressure until the medium shifts stance and releases the unsent words. One meaningful tightening occurs when she touches the third window and time folds backward, reweighting her original refusal. Cost is legible: "fierce tenderness of admitting she'd been wrong" and the shard crumbling. Minor causal slip: the mechanics of how the dream-message will reach Marina are asserted but not constrained by prior scene logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (hospital atrium, post-blast recovery). The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to the present cast-writing ceremony, deepening Maya's stance from isolated survivor to collaborative healer. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maya relinquishes sole ownership of survival meaning by gifting the coral and sitting in shared silence, foreclosing her prior isolation with visible cost (the relic she salvaged becomes the child's anchor). One persistent weakness: the epiphany "understood then why she'd survived" is stated rather than earned through a final image that reweights prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (apple blossoms, festival scenes, knowledge network pulse), and the final return to daydream offers a cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line three (Marina, studio-cave, fragment). Closure is Charged Poise—she resolves to venture deeper tomorrow, reweighting her stance from isolated study to networked mission—but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactic change occurs in the ending beat. The midpoint tightening (network activation) deepens her access but does not narrow options with immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn Elena is a restorer mid-paragraph, and the garden's acoustic function is told rather than anchored through concrete spatial detail. The "nested awakenings" closure (Elena realizing she's lived this loop before and choosing to repeat it) is asserted via disembodied voice rather than earned through on-page causality—nothing in her prior three months of restoration foreshadows this metaphysical recursion. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: anchors arrive late and the garden's mechanics remain vague. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost (painting over her work) is undermotivated and the lens wavers between metaphysical reveal and character choice without teaching the pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows a Situational lens: pressure mounts as Auditors close in, forcing Marcus to deploy his prepared defenses while Serena escapes. The closure—Marcus smiling as the door bursts open, knowing Serena is planting—qualifies as Charged Poise: options crystallize (he will face interrogation; the message will be planted) and the stance reconfigures meaning (resistance as ecosystem persists despite capture). Cost is felt but not fully on-page; we see him choosing to stay and face consequences, yet the exact price remains just offstage, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (shell, postcard, half-sung lullabies) across centuries and trusts cadence shift and density to reweight the armistice premise. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "Beauty and pain learned to coexist… The shell holds them all." The cost is oblique—time dissolved, the postcard "nearly dissolved"—but conceptual heft is present. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. One persistent issue: the centuries-long timeframe compresses all escalation into summary, so no single tightening moment lands on the page with felt urgency; the piece teaches the pattern early and pays it off in tone, preventing a harder penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the cracked chime's widening, the song becoming clearer, and Mira's race against the bamboo's final split. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration—the name joins the constellation, shifting Mira's purpose from search to stewardship. Cost is conceptual (the object breaks, the search ends) but legible in "until she too became a name requiring preservation." One meaningful tightening (the crack spreading) drives the single scene to its cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a causal through-line: discovery → translation → preparation to present. The closure lands on the page as Charged Poise—Elena ascending with the means to restore harmony, the councils' reconvened song made possible—but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than felt in the present moment. The drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (the symphonies metaphor deepens), holding coherently to the end. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the promises were reinforcing each other and begins writing the restoration, narrowing her options to this single summit opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes Mara's goal (repair floodgates, harmonize factions) and advances through her discovery of the dual-resin envelope, her mapping of new floodgate positions, and the leaving of carved plans—a coherent causal chain. Closure reads as Charged Poise: she departs with dappled resolve, the floodgates poised to teach interdependence; the cost is implicit (her anonymity, the risk of failure) but the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is prompt (name, amphitheater, volcanic basin by the opening lines). The inferred lens is Causal with lyric-accumulative texture; the ending holds under that lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "begins to tremble" and crystallizes her plan, narrowing options from general repair to specific choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust-mote meditation, paper-trail reimagining, and meteorite talisman accumulate toward a resonant reconfiguration when Theodore's envelope reweights Margot's self-understanding. Orientation anchors (attic, Bellweather's Books, Margot as cataloger) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The closure unit—Margot recognizing her younger handwriting and accepting the preserved trail—lands with conceptual cost (she cannot fully escape or rewrite her past), though the cost feels more intellectual than viscerally paid on the page. The piece holds its lens and teaches its pattern of lyric accretion without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with atmospheric density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit (Marina at the threshold, whispering back, choosing to "build bridges") reconfigures her stance from seeker to architect, but the cost remains abstract: no on-page action is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no prior capability spent. The final image charges prior motifs (weather codes, thresholds, distances) yet the felt price is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates detail (burnt feather, alignment, city glow, fish patterns, jellies) toward a resonant final image, but the closure lacks felt cost—Mira's realization is declarative and her stance shift carries no visible price or foreclosed path. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The city's luminous respite unfolds as observation rather than a pressure point that narrows her options, weakening the tightening requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph (orientation clean). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the recollectionist gathers fragments, reflects on their meaning, and the sprouts in the final third offer a Conceptual Repricing—paths don't disappear, they transform. However, the repricing arrives late without strong causal pressure building toward it; the sprouts feel seeded for thematic closure rather than earned through prior escalation. Cost is conceptual (the mystery deepens, work never finishes) but remains abstract rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or reweighted choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (boardwalk, tidal arcade, stars) by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: beats accrue through performances, the bishop's rotations, and the final packing ritual, with the guitar pick serving as a late accent that reweights the routine. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marcus packs, acknowledges "nothing would be identical," and the waves erase his footprints, crystallizing his stance of perpetual recalibration. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: opportunity cost of this liminal life is implied but not dramatized on the page. The cadence shift from performance to reflective packing supports the lens, though a sharper on-page price would elevate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates celestial imagery and spreads moonstone dust across the garden to seed future rebellion. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the garden becomes a living document of resistance. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the cost remains abstract—"tomorrow she would be gone"—without specifying capture, injury, or forfeiture on the page. The escalation is atmospheric (dust multiplying, light spreading) rather than a choice-driven tightening, which lowers pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: Marcus observes ripple patterns, dawn light through prisms, building toward a conceptual repricing where he resolves to teach others before the bulldozers come. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image crystallizes his stance—"a clear view through"—with felt cost (atrium will fall, career ends, but lesson persists). One meaningful deepening occurs as dawn floods the atrium and he commits to documentation. Deduction: the development company letter functions as convenient external pressure rather than emerging organically from prior causality, and the cost could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection (old woman's gift, fire memory, celestial event) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus reframes teaching as translation of scars. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening (Marcus on ridge path, moonlit, carrying box). The closure is a Charged Poise: he descends with new resolve, the box transformed from burden to compass, ready to share vulnerability. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of his protective emotional distance and the choice to expose failure. One deduction: the phone and recording setup materialize without prior mention, a minor convenience that doesn't break causality but slightly softens inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres: the piece offers discovery-summary rather than tightening pressure. Orientation is delayed—who Marina is and why she's in the grotto remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. No on-page closure: the grandmother's dissolution into light and Marina's plan to "begin teaching others" constitute off-page intent, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The "understanding" arrives as assertion, not dramatized shift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Mira, ivy-veiled passage, post-climate university). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered discoveries (film negative → Voss diary → hidden recordings) that deepen Mira's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she places her notebook beside Voss's, continuing the tradition with felt cost (solitude, burden accepted). The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical turn, but the final image reweights "legacy's burden" from inheritance to active preservation. One meaningful deepening present.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates painted messages across the city, building toward a final resonant image where the sparrow sings Sophia's lullaby back and Maya completes the painting. Orientation anchors (terrace, dawn, Maya at easel) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the borrowed heartbeat grows stronger, doors open in possibility-space, and Maya's campaign of painted maps reaches a charged endpoint. Cost is conceptual and felt (three months of elusive painting, the hush she engineered, the trembling fingers) rather than a decisive physical loss. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sparrow responds, reweighting prior accumulation. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Mara on terrace, twin suns, biennial alignment) and holds a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through Mara's protocol breach and the clipboard revelation until the final image of delegates approaching it in shared recognition. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "something in between, like suns touching" crystallizes the shift from certified hatred to the "first crack," with cost legible in the renunciation of pride and righteousness. The single-scene design with clear spatial choreography and one meaningful deepening (from recitation of grievances to collective recognition of personal grief) fits 600–800-word scope. One causal convenience—delegates' rapid understanding—slightly weakens the tightening but does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pattern through burial imagery and manufactured catastrophes, reaching Conceptual Repricing at closure when "salvation looked exactly like destruction" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the egg cracks by design, transforming preservation into active fossilization. The closure effect lands on the page with felt cost (the egg's transformation, the diverted storm), though some key destructions (the three rivers, the indigenous displacement) occur off-page and are told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lyralei untangles threads while absorbing echoes, building toward a tonal reconfiguration at the sanctuary door. The orientation is clear (courtyard, night, Academy), and the final image (empty sanctuary, melted snow circles) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and external—"Academy would wake to find"—rather than a visible on-page price Lyralei herself pays. The closure reweights her stance but does not demonstrate what she loses or forecloses in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—Marcus begins preparing a performance and ends preparing it, with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The piece reads as setup and exposition for a future performance rather than a story with closure; the "meteor hush" and final smile restate his existing stance without cost or transformation. Under a situational or accumulative lens, pressure should crystallize or a pattern should break with felt consequence, but the ending restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered history (cloud dwellers, luna moth, monarch migration) and the final image reweights the opening premise with visible cost (structures dissolving, Mira descending in darkness). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the monarch's departure crystallizes the story's stakes—preservation through impermanence—and the cost (everything dissolves, leaving only traces) is legible in the final paragraphs. One minor slip: the middle section's exposition about moth-wing encoding and cloud dweller civilization slows accumulation without adding a turn or deepening the present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear before/after: Elsa moves from guilt to purpose through the rope's revelation. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The closure lands—casting bronze bells and reframing preservation as transformation—with felt cost (acceptance of loss, new responsibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when the punched card reveals her ancestor's name, reweighting her mission. The cost is visible: she must leave the old model of preservation behind.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the lens reads as Conceptual/Accumulative with a Conceptual Repricing at closure when Kira realizes foresight is reverse-time memory. The revelation reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (she is living backward, never understanding causality), satisfying CR requirements. However, the closure moment itself—removing the crown and walking out—lacks a felt price that forecloses a live option; she accepts what she already foresaw, making the "transcending through acceptance" feel predetermined rather than chosen. The seventeen-minute storm countdown and the three-level descent establish clear causal sequencing, but Kira's agency throughout is observational rather than decisive, which blunts escalation under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discovery layers (blueprints → tile → cuneiform → phosphorescent map) building toward the beacon activation. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mara's "frugal years" are retrospective summary, not a present forfeiture; the contact is achieved without on-page loss or trade-off. The final paragraph asserts that devotion "purchased something invaluable" and "proof" was gained, but no specific price is paid in the ending beat itself. Under the Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or density spike should reweight the stake with felt cost; here the ending dilates into thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation remains vague: the sanctuary "existed between heartbeats" and communication flows "through touch and intention" without concrete anchoring of who, where, when by ~120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—Magistrate's cellular memory rewrite—lacks visible cost on the page; his son's fever "would break within the hour" is Marcus's assertion, not dramatized consequence. Causality relies on metaphysical mechanics (cellular memory, reality warping) introduced as givens rather than earned through scene pressure. The inferred lens is Situational-Accumulative Hybrid, but the ending summarizes transformation rather than staging it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the broken sextant, fog-mirrors, synchronized breathing, and final hand-mirror form a coherent pattern that reweights the astronomer's quest. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"some dreams aren't meant to be chased but inhabited"—with the conceptual cost legible in the astronomer's shift from capture to carriage. Orientation anchors (Elara, workshop, twilight) arrive early. The vision sequence deepens pressure through sensory accumulation, and the final mirror gift reconfigures the premise with cost (accepting permanence over retrieval). One meaningful tightening occurs when the astronomer breaks rhythm and the vision fades, forcing Elara's prepared response.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal undertones. The closure—Elara teaching Mira, mending the eyes together, explicitly letting the vow fall—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (transmission replaces isolation) with felt relational cost. Orientation is clean by the third paragraph. The "wrong bag" moment is a micro turn that reweights her stance. One meaningful deepening (realizing wisdom requires teaching) suffices at this length and the cost is legible in her choice to share the tools.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the museum collects from all times simultaneously, and the curator will loop through this experience. The cost is conceptual—she loses linear agency and becomes part of the artifact cycle—made legible in the final image of biting the paradox-apple. Accumulative lens holds through layered temporal reveals (shell → orchard → bathroom → other-self → understanding). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (curator, astral orchard, asteroid). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes inheritance creates itself. Slight deduction: the middle bathroom retreat slightly softens pressure before the final revelation rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through deepening layers (three chambers, trap room, amber chamber) with image accumulation (humming books, singing volumes, glowing specimens). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's offer transforms the library from hoard to garden, releasing seekers. Cost is present but oblique: the diary's blank pages fill with silver text, implying future labor, though the immediate cost to Mira remains abstract. Orientation anchors quickly (mountain door, bookstore, three levels down) and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, swatch cards, carousel horses, and the final pocket-warm emerald build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—Marina chooses the harder freedom, carrying proof of the unprovable). The closure lands on the page with felt cost ("knowing you'll never quite recapture what was already yours"), and the inferred lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina learns her mother's emerald ring disappeared the day Coraline did, reweighting the swatch's meaning. Minor causality wobble: the garden's mechanics are poetic but never constrain a tactic or enable a specific choice, remaining thematic décor.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: details accrue, the rope's configurations deepen, and the final image of stepping through the impossible door reweights prior material with conceptual cost (she carries proof of "absences as presences"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (clock tower mechanism room, Elara, diplomatic pouches). The thirteenth-chime constraint creates genuine pressure and the closure lands—though the cost reads more conceptual than felt, it reconfigures the premise with undeniable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story operates through density increase and pattern reweighting rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors are clear early (mapkeeper, harmonic caves, three days post-arrival). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bloom of hush teaches the beings quietude, transforming cacophony into woven music) with conceptual cost visible in the final image—"hammered repose" achieved not through force but revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she extracts the crystallized silence and it expands to modulate the beings' frequencies. The lens holds cleanly through accumulative pressure to a charged final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (custodian, pavilion, seventeen years) and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens that tracks density increase toward the beacon's rekindling. Closure lands on-page with the ships returning and Mira's realization that "coincidences were conspiracies of light"—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her seventeen-year vigil. However, the cost remains largely conceptual and retrospective rather than felt in the climactic moment; the vision-guided assembly of prism and shard proceeds without friction or surprise, weakening the sense of foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (observatory, Lyra, post-fog world) arrive by ~150 words, slightly late but functional. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (crystals, lightning, shadow lengths) and Lyra's reflection to deepen thematic weight rather than trace causal turns. Closure operates as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of survivors gathering to "sculpt new identities from shared experience" reweights the premise—but the cost remains abstract and felt off-page (humanity trapped below) rather than legible in Lyra's on-page choice or renunciation. The evening ritual is described, not dramatized, leaving the closure unit declared rather than enacted with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational/Accumulative lens: despair presses down, Kaia gathers resources, the community fires rockets, hope blooms. Orientation is clear (fortress courtyard at dusk). However, closure lacks felt cost—the fireworks succeed immediately, the community responds on cue, and no path is foreclosed. The "REMEMBER WONDER" tiles promise a turn but simply confirm what Kaia already intended. No meaningful tightening occurs; the escalation is additive assembly rather than pressure-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (grotto, two characters, tidal pools) land cleanly within the first third. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers recurring images (cicada, pools, transitions) to reweight the concept of witnessing change. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "Tomorrow, Mira knew, he would return to help with the chronicle. The pools had already foretold it." The cost, however, is oblique—Chen's fear is acknowledged but not paid for on the page by Mira's agency; the ending reads as inevitability rather than choice with visible consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (Chen's confession of foresight), meeting length expectations, but the final image lacks tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the inversion phenomenon creates a pressure window in which Mira harvests silence, and the sprouting doll crystallizes her thematic shift from compression to expansion. Orientation anchors (trellis, observation deck, seven-minute countdown) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Mira's decision to bring her father a vial—functions as Conceptual Repricing: the vial reweights "safety" from concrete walls to captured wonder. The cost, however, is more conceptual than felt; we see her satchel grow heavy and the doll reform, but the price of her transformation (what she forfeits by choosing this path) remains abstract rather than viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece lands Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman learns to listen differently, Marcus completes another passage) with conceptual cost implicit in the train-whistle callback. Orientation is clear early. However, the escalation is almost purely pedagogical—Marcus teaches, she receives—with no reversal or tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The storm glass vial suggests atmospheric pressure changes but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it functions as mood indicator rather than stake-shaper. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is weak; under Accumulative, the density doesn't meaningfully shift until the Mirror Gallery callback, which arrives late and feels decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing: the throne's purpose is revealed as a monument to restraint, reweighting the quest premise. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique—Anya dissolves the ruby flake and returns home with knowledge, but no live option is foreclosed and no tactical price is visible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered paint reveals, song ritual, fragment network), held consistently, but the closure lacks the felt or relational cost required for higher bands. Midpoint coherence is strong; the mural sequence advances knowledge in motivated steps.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (doorknocker ring, scars, shadows) and the final paragraph attempts a conceptual repricing. However, orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge slowly across the first 150+ words without clear anchoring. The closure unit is present (teaching the darkness that bridges must burn to light the way forward) but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or forfeiture legibly alters the keeper's options or stance. The ending recycles the opening premise rather than reweighting it with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (causal setup with accumulative/lyric closure attempt). Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/when within opening). The bolt-turning moment provides a micro-turn, and the promise-to-diamond transformation offers a conceptual repricing. However, the cost remains abstract—Marina gains magical diamonds and enlightenment without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The glitchy messages solve problems they didn't help create, arriving as deus ex machina rather than emerging from prior causality. Closure reconfigures meaning but the felt cost is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the gramophone revelation layers history, the standing waves deepen perception, and the final act (throwing the crank, choosing not-knowing) reconfigures the premise with visible cost—she forfeits the gift and the estate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Victoria refuses the family power and accepts isolation, foreclosing the dynastic path. The orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure with one reflective interlude fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but wavers—metaphoric density increases steadily, yet no decisive turn or deepening reweights the stake with legible cost. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into "guardian"), but the cost remains abstract: what did Aldric forfeit by taking the puppet's hand? The "unsnapping" action at the end echoes the Grand Alchemist's historic act, yet no prior causality compels this exact repetition, and the final image ("glow of unmanifest tomorrows") names theme rather than charging a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (Marcus, file room, post-emancipation archivist position). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, marginalia, and small artifacts accrue meaning until the final image reweights Marcus's quest—healing comes not from finding his mother's story but from witnessing imperfect attempts at love throughout the archives. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final paragraph explicitly restates that "some wounds required archaeology to heal; others needed only a witness," shifting from a search for personal answers to a validation of accumulated grace. The cost is felt—Marcus accepts延ed searching over immediate resolution—though the closing lines veer toward thematic summary rather than a charged image, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Mira's gift for reading reflections → discovery of tunnel coordinates → retrieval of evidence → dissemination before Ministry strikes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. However, the closure—uploading files and emerging victorious—unfolds largely off-page or in summary ("By dawn, they'd uploaded everything"), robbing the ending of felt cost. The Ministry's strike on the resistance leaders functions as convenient distraction rather than genuine complication that Mira's choices navigate. One meaningful tightening occurs (the time pressure of the impending arrests), but the resolution reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a reconfiguration with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Marcus, grotto, prophecy threat) land by ~150 words, slightly delayed but functional. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence accrues density until the prophecy "sleeps beneath blankets of unplayed jazz." Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis—Marcus wraps the prophecy in protective silence with the cost that it will wake again and require perpetual vigilance. The cost is conceptual and forward-facing rather than immediately felt on the page, which keeps the effect in mid-band rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning (seeds, leaves, monuments, moss). Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Ashen Skyborne Arbor, seed-sorting, Mira), satisfying the early test. However, closure lacks felt cost: Mira's transformation is pure gain—silver hair, new eyes, moss signature, translator role—without on-page renunciation or price. The final image reconfigures her purpose but the "burden" mentioned is immediately reframed as "delight," undercutting any tension. The RR attempt (transformation) does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (waterfall, clocks, leaves, compass) toward a conceptual repricing of "brokenness as function," but the closure unit lacks felt cost—Marcus's epiphany arrives as realization without foreclosing a live option or paying a price. The greenhouse discovery and pattern-mapping feel like smooth additions rather than tightening reversals. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the two-location structure (workshop → greenhouse) is legible, but the ending restates theme without reweighting prior material through visible sacrifice or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the coin's physical transformation and the kintsugi metaphor deepen through the scene to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost—Mira's acceptance that wonder means embracing brokenness—is legible in the final image of the transformed coin and their shared exit. However, the escalation relies heavily on Vera's exposition rather than dramatized pressure, and the search-party frame (established as urgent stakes) dissolves without consequence once Mira is found.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Mara at gorge entrance, pre-dawn, soul collector). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Thomas embraces the broken harp, dissolves into light, and Mara continues her work with another soul stirring—a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (spectral confession leading to release) with felt cost (Thomas's dissolution, Mara's ongoing solitary labor). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara shifts from listening to demonstrating laughter through deliberate off-key performance. Cost is legible in Thomas's dissolution and Mara's resumption of the cycle, though the dissolve-into-light moment flirts with convenience by bypassing the mechanics of release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory precision and recurring "mathematics" imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Lyra renounces the strap and commits to teaching, foreclosing revenge or isolation with visible cost (leaving the station, kneeling at calculated distance). Orientation anchors (recovery station, ultraviolet forest, post-treaty exile) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. The closure image—smiling with "exact pull of seventeen facial muscles" and "precision felt like freedom"—reweights prior pain-data into healing-data with undeniable pressure. One micro turn (removing the strap) tightens her stance. Cost is legible: she abandons the recovery station and the physical token of her torture, choosing pedagogical penance over solitary endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (alchemist's market, Mira's POV, present confrontation at Valdric's stall). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the painting's layers unfold through sensory detail and pattern (pentimento shadows, color-coded coordinates, constellation map), and the closure reconfigures Mira's childhood learning into present purpose. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—stories dancing in fog—reweights the opening gift and crystallizes the mission with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One deduction: the middle beats (scraping, translating, understanding) accumulate density without a meaningful tightening or complication that narrows options; the discovery unfolds smoothly without resistance, reducing escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story infers as Causal with Accumulative accents (dust patterns, journal discoveries, cascading evidence). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus accepts the burden his grandmother carried and commits to exposing the conspiracy, winding the spring "one final turn" as a promise to fix broken systems. Cost is legible—he inherits a dangerous, isolating vigil—and the lens holds. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when Teresa's counting stops and she points upward, narrowing Marcus's options and raising stakes. Minor deduction: the sudden materialization of multiple ghosts in the final third feels like a late escalation rather than organic accumulation, slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns and whispers accrue symbolic weight toward the final compression. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the library dissolves and Moth becomes pattern—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page ("let herself scatter"). Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by ~100 words). The uncorking moment functions as a hinge but the causal chain from bottle to dissolution feels inevitable without genuine friction or a narrowing of options. The ending reconfigures the premise but lacks the visceral price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear archaeological dispute stake and delivers orientation (baroque asteroid, temporal streams visible post-Revelation) within the first third. The escalation from ownership claim to civilization-resurrection proposal follows a causal arc, and the closure—Cassia committing to translate Venusian whispers into verse—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her poetic skill and revolutionary empathy converge. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt: we do not see what Cassia risks by defying Institute protocols or what immediate consequence her plan will trigger. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture (temporal imagery, mirror motifs), held cleanly to the end, but the price legibility at closure is more implied than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal chain holds: Elias's decision to tether all boxes → combined resonance → light breaks curse, with Vex's intrusion providing a micro-turn that escalates stakes. Closure is a Decisive Change (dawn restored) with felt cost to Vex and conceptual cost to the Covenant, though Elias himself pays no visible price—the triumph arrives without personal forfeiture, which slightly dulls the edge of the ending's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly and follows an accumulative lens: descent → discovery → vision → collection → withdrawal. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Vera acknowledges the door and defers crossing with visible cost ("someday, when she was ready"). The cost is felt but muted; her return to "ordinary air" and the "sensibly eccentric" frame undercuts the weight of renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs via the psychometric vision, which reweights the lagoon from geological curiosity to threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece offers a clear before/after: Marina arrives storm-tossed and directionless, then leaves reimagined with a new compass. However, the closure relies on metaphorical reweighting ("turbine-hum of wind through stone became her compass") rather than a concrete on-page action or renunciation with felt cost—she simply drives away, enlightened. The magic lantern's appearance and the sculpture's completion function as stations in an accumulative/textural design, yet the escalation is more meditative deepening than pressure-driven tightening. Orientation is swift and clean; the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but the final image asserts transformation rather than dramatizing the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's final act of hiding the postcards crystallizes her understanding that certain beauties refuse scrutiny, reweighting her winter-to-winter journey with visible cost (she walks away stained, carrying a gift "she hadn't yet given"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery and the pavilion transforms across seasons—with a meaningful cadence shift at the solstice when she "understood." Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). One friction: the midpoint pivot ("The postcards hadn't been documentation—they'd been instruction") is told rather than discovered through scene pressure, softening causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lagoon, diary, and Marcus's instructions layer meaning toward a final thematic reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (archivist, zeppelin, Sahara, morning arrival). However, closure relies on understanding delivered through exposition ("she finally understood") rather than a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The pattern of "encryption as courage" is stated, not dramatized at the ending beat, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Silas, Paper-Lantern Cove, post-wish arrival. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—memory-essence drains molecule by molecule, images flood and transform, the town "shimmers with potential." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of synchronized jellyfish and the promise of dream-drawn arrivals reweights the premise from ghost town to intentional rebirth. Felt cost is present (bottle crumbles, hours of will-work) but the narrative confidence that "people would begin arriving" and "revival had begun" edges toward assertion rather than image-driven resonance, slightly softening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the foghorn's silence, the wax shaving discovery, the childhood memory, and the prophecy fulfillment, culminating in a transcription act that reweights the opening stakes. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the manuscript becomes a rosetta stone of emotional patterns, reframing Matthias's life work. Orientation anchors (oath scribe, rooftop garden, post-apocalyptic drowned city) land cleanly by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shaving reveals impossible temporal layering. Cost is conceptual but legible: "his work finally complete" signals finality and the foreclosure of further searching.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph and the piece holds a single POV across one continuous atrium scene. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: seed-sorting, vortex-slowing, and garden-reformation build density toward the acorn planting and oak rebirth. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira plants the acorn "furiously tranquil" with a smile, and no on-page forfeit or reweighted consequence lands; the "vortex inheritance" merely continues rather than exacting a price. The final image reconfigures potential (continuation vs. ending) but the felt cost remains offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal: barometric anomaly → stone vibration → animals flee → bell ring → avalanche. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Mara shifts from observer to guardian, and the villages evacuate. The cost is legible—she remains at her post, isolated, having staked her credibility on primal warning methods. One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses the bell over the electronic switch. Minor slip: the avalanche "triggered by deep tectonic shifts her instruments had detected as pressure changes" arrives as retrospective explanation rather than dramatized discovery, softening the causal spine at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (tracking station, edge of known space, cosmic janitor) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered observation until the still star reweights Kepler-9's understanding of stillness and presence. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the janitor's renewed purpose and acceptance of their post—with conceptual cost legible in the acceptance of obsolescence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the still star's appearance transforms the protagonist's stance. Causality is contemplative rather than plot-driven, but the lens holds and the RR is earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery of the box → ghost gestures → understanding the covenant's failure → decision to preserve. Orientation anchors (Mara, oasis, post-apocalyptic timeline) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara's decision to remain and preserve the silence forecloses the path of leaving or speaking, with the conceptual cost visible in her commitment to solitude. One minor lens wobble: the ghost subplot introduces light Situational pressure (their gestures force interpretation) but resolves back to Accumulative mode at closure, maintaining coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural but never teaches its pattern or delivers a meaningful deepening; instead it unfolds as linear exposition: Marcus enters silo → reads ads → understands Voss's plan → leaves with new purpose. The Orientation Test is borderline (who/where/when emerge slowly but are present by ~15% mark). No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the "understanding" arrives as sudden revelation without prior friction. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the texture-of-time answer to a numbering crisis), but the cost is asserted ("borrowed though it was") rather than felt or demonstrated in a concrete image. The final paragraph moralizes the theme instead of letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and cadence shift; the kite-string snap provides a single meaningful tightening that reweights Mira's reflective practice with the boy's immediate loss. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the boy clutching the broken kite and Mira returning to her notebook crystallizes their shared recognition of beauty-through-brokenness, and the cost is conceptual (acceptance of impermanence) though not sharply felt on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Single continuous scene, one transition to dawn, coherent lens held to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure lands on the page: Mira understands her role as translator and stakes her final months on teaching the next caretaker, a Charged Poise configuration where options crystallize with felt cost (her death reframed as "appointment"). Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—copper network builds toward conceptual reweighting rather than causal reversal—and holds through the ending. The cost is conceptual and relational (she will die into translation; the orchard's patience continues) but the price is more stated than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when the network completes and she realizes the tumor's function, narrowing her path to teaching and documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece accumulates discoveries (synthetic polymers, neurochemical triggers, DNA instructions) toward the final realization that humanity is the experiment, which reweights the premise with conceptual cost (loss of autonomy, scripted transcendence). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—"doubt and faith were both part of the design"—delivers CR, though the cost remains conceptual and somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, but the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory layering, dead-language invocations, and the gulls-as-translator conceit, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the final image reweights war/garden into a cycle of digestion and forgetting. Cost is conceptual—erasure as mercy—and felt in "no one would remember why anyone had thought this shore worth killing for," though the coachman himself pays no visible price and makes no on-page choice that forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seeds begin splitting in the closing paragraph, shifting from intention to irreversible process.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Heap, shipping container, Sage's den) and the drive lens reads Causal: leaf → phonograph → grooves → map → journey → valley. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sage's howl summons the lost, transforming her role from body-finder to living-connector, with the cost felt in her ended retirement and new obligation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf's veins translate into routes. Minor slip: the valley's impossible fertility and the children's gathering mechanism arrive with minimal setup, creating a small causality softness that does not break the ending but reduces inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Kira, observation deck, post-shutdown) land by the second paragraph. The story accumulates pressure through layered images—the vanished stars, the gilded compass, the sketched constellation—and closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kira becomes the fixed point as crewmates begin to appear, her sketching a continuous act that reweights isolation into navigation. Cost is conceptual and felt (she transforms her pariah status into a permanent beacon role), though the final image could make the foreclosed path more explicit. The lens holds; the ending reconfigures prior material without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (spire, Renn, wrong sky by ~50 words). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens: Renn's amendment reweights the premise of cataloging wonder with a felt cost (her master failed, she inherits his unfinished work). The tightening is legible—swapping secrets for questions—but the Keeper's approval arrives without friction, reducing the sense of foreclosed paths. One meaningful deepening is present; cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Marina's final "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" crystallizes her stance against becoming official witness, foreclosing participation in the new government with felt cost (isolation, continued marginalization). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The interregnum as liminal space creates coherent situational pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the other survivor arrives and Marina refuses, reweighting her solitary documentation against communal testimony. The accumulative-textural lens holds through the walking-words pattern to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (seer), where (mountain bookstore), and when (after remembering became painful) by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the stone's arrival seeds a pattern of sensory memory that deepens through the descent, culminating in the garden as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with Charged Poise—she plants instead of seeking visions, forecloses prophecy with visible cost). One meaningful deepening occurs when she kneels and remembers her original calling. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (decades of prophecy set aside), and the inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaspar forgives himself and walks away, foreclosing the path of self-condemnation with visible cost (the copper piece offering, the acceptance that he cannot unfreeze the village or undo the mistake). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered imagery (frozen village, platinum labyrinth, tapestry threads) and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear early (exiled tutor, time-frozen village, central square). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaspar decodes the tapestry and sees his own error mirrored, which deepens his self-understanding and enables the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: whispers multiply into chorus, refraction becomes the story's structural method, and the ending reconfigures the canyon from silencing instrument to transmitter. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the Silencers' ritual space is transformed before they can use it, reweighting the premise of control with undeniable conceptual cost ("forgiveness had never been theirs to withhold"). The orientation anchor is clean (towers, canyon, three-hour countdown), and the single meaningful deepening (chamber occupation → irreversible acoustic memory) tightens the stake. A minor causality slip: how prisoners "hidden in the hollows" hear and respond so quickly lacks spatial grounding, but the lens holds and the ending lands with conceptual heft.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (workshop, statue, acid sea) and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mira's final plunge crystallizes the achievement—kintsugi memories preserved in the charm—with undeniable cost (her life). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal (platform tilting, supports snapping) and escalates pressure toward the final image. Cost is conceptual and felt; the story earns its ending under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (recurring shells, painting ritual) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina gains the sanctuary and reweights her life's work without abandoning either practice. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The cracked mirror trigger feels slightly convenient—it's declared prophetic in the grandmother's journal rather than earning its force through Marina's prior causality. Cost is present (the daily return to ghosthood) but the discovery sequence relies on coincidence more than protagonist agency to unlock the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: jasmine scent spirals, intentions purify, shimmer gains substance through repeated lighthouse-beam rotations. Orientation is clean (Mara, lighthouse, dawn, post-heat-wave). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Thomas solidifying, but the cost is unclear—Mara pulls him forward "not fully human, perhaps never again" without dramatizing what she or he forfeits. The "new way of being" is asserted in summary rather than shown through a final image that reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs (shimmer to solid shadow), but the Accumulative lens requires the final cadence to charge closure with undeniable pressure; here it diffuses into abstraction ("gentle violence of refusing to let go").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina explicitly renounces the reverse migration pull, accepting her role as guide with the cost of permanent separation. The final image—"She would not leave. She would build bridges from words until the last caller found their way home"—reweights her patchwork identity and the bronze foot's warmth into a called vocation. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Diego's call forces her to articulate the endurance choice, foreclosing the path of return with felt cost ("I learned that some of us are meant to stay").

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (the cure quest). Orientation anchors quickly: Mara, ravine, post-virus present. The escalation—finding hidden truffles, mixing the cure, drinking it, regaining choice—links causally and tightens options (she can't continue confessing indefinitely). Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the eye clouds, she gains discretion but inherits the burden of choosing when to speak truth. The resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise into rebuilding) is legible, though the final paragraph's wider social mission dilutes immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece employs an accumulative lens: fragments of memory align across lighthouse sweeps, building toward the realization that the stranger was Magnus's son returning stolen memories. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dock, nautical twilight) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Magnus accepts his watch with companioned memories rather than abandoning it, and the final swimming figure suggests his son's survival or a memory surfacing, reweighting prior material. Cost is legible: decades lost, a son raised apart, isolation chosen anew. One meaningful deepening (discovery of the son's identity and the pile of objects) narrows options and charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights Marcus's identity from passive dealer to active guide. The creek-rising timeframe and ant-following method create coherent pressure. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The closure unit lands on the page, but the cost is oblique—Marcus exits the cavern unchanged in circumstance, only in self-conception, and the story tells us he's ready to guide others rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or tradeoff that makes the shift legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal arc: dreams → warning → climb → revelation → transformation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change (human to firefly-queen) with visible cost (loss of human form, perpetuation of the curse), and the lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative layering. One deduction: the grotto's explanation arrives as exposition rather than discovery through action, slightly weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: twilight imagery, the shell's spiral, and scientific vocabulary build density toward the final pocket-sun breakthrough, which lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the method shifts from capture to invitation). The closure carries conceptual cost—Lyra relinquishes her three-year approach—and the shell-sun image reweights prior material. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines). The causal link from touching shell to nexus to breakthrough feels slightly convenient but remains within accumulative tolerances.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the birch bark scroll recurs, reweighted each time, and the final image (Maya documenting flight while already soaring) constitutes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise of chronicling versus living. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, Maya, scroll) arrive early and remain stable. The cost is legible conceptually—she loses linear causality and selfhood—but the final beat's felt price is diffuse; the "unaware she was already soaring" lands as irony rather than a decisive foreclosure of options. One meaningful deepening (grave visit → flying contemplation → stepping outside) tightens the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (repair shop, pre-dawn fog, Mrs. Huang's arrival), establishing a Situational lens that accumulates pressure through grief-laden objects. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Mara's reflection on repair as "integration of damage" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (accepting brokenness as part of ongoing function). The birthing clamp screw's journey from blockage to deliberate looseness provides a meaningful tightening, though the final beat leans heavily on thematic articulation rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture. Cost is felt but remains oblique; the piece would benefit from a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (floating platform, final test, crow quill). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: accumulative pressure (crystalline spread, memory layering) resolves through a causal act (tracing her scars creates the rune). Closure lands on the page with visible cost—she sheds shame by integrating folklore—and the rune's creation is a Decisive Change. However, the held-breath mechanism and the grandmother's rhyme both arrive late (second half), and the causality of "holding breath → insight → perfect rune" compresses discovery into a single pressurized moment without prior failed attempts or tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera shifts from violent exorcism to collaborative completion with visible cost (her former approach is abandoned, the requiem replaces her triumphant column narrative). Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative accent—email summons, apology, perfume mechanics, collaborative transcription, Elisabetta's dissolution. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the orchard's destruction creates the deadline that forces the requiem's completion before Elisabetta's final departure. Cost is legible in Elisabetta's dissolution and Vera's realization that she "destroyed their first collaboration."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Kaia, temple library, universe ending) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered etymologies and overlapping apocalypses until the final dictionary entry reweights the premise. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—"the question that answers itself" reconfigures the cosmic cycle—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing appears on the page. The "Continue" command gestures toward ongoing recursion but lacks the felt price that would elevate this to Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered reflection, counting ritual, and recurring motifs (key, water, horizon, razor edges) toward a conceptual realization. Orientation is clear early (shepherd at cliff station, post-whistle). The closure offers Conceptual Repricing: "time was not a river or a wheel, but the razor edge between what was and what would be." However, the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page decision forecloses a path or alters tactics. The final image restates her purpose without visible friction or sacrifice, reading more as thematic summary than a moment where prior material is reweighed with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elena accepts the contradiction between her father's gambling and her equations), but the cost is conceptual only—writing a subway message—with no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice on the page. Orientation is prompt: professor, library, storm, father's recent heart attack. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of subway messages, lantern imagery, probability/chaos motifs converge). However, the stranger's arrival and instant explanatory dialogue ("We're cartographers of contradiction") functions as exposition that tells Elena what she's been doing rather than forcing a choice that crystallizes it. The ending image of "lucid and contradictory" restates the theme without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates mood and pattern rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and cleanly. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of practiced disconnection, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("beautifully, necessarily lost") rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. The ending restates the premise without visible consequence or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal discovery of the fire → accumulative ethical weighing → a final Resonant Reconfiguration via the codicil). Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Mara has acted, Eleanor receives peace, and the codicil ensures future reckoning—options are reweighted and a path foreclosed. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant (future archivists will know), not viscerally felt in the present exchange, and Eleanor's unawareness of the codicil softens the immediate pressure. The fire backstory and seventeen-year career are efficient setup, but the three-day reflection window is told rather than dramatized, creating a causality seam between discovery and decision.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus holding the phone understands he's been catalyzed, reweighting the transaction from object-exchange to human-connection engine. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchoring (Platform Three, ivy, pillar). One meaningful tightening occurs when Sadie reveals the satellite phone's true purpose, narrowing Marcus's options from passive collector to active node. Cost is legible—Marcus must now answer calls and engage—though the price feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: languages and sensory details accrue toward the stillpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara "carries the stillpoint within her" without forfeiting anything on the page or facing a constraint that narrows options. The ending asserts transformation ("changed," "never leave her") but does not dramatize what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. One meaningful deepening occurs (forest heart to stillpoint), but the RR requires felt cost that remains absent.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (situational pressure with conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The anomaly's mechanics—selective filtering that edits history per observer—are explained mid-story and create the final choice, but causality leans expository: Mira reasons her way to the discovery rather than the anomaly forcing escalating tactical dilemmas. Closure lands as Charged Poise (transmitting both coordinates crystallizes the stakes), yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally legible on the page—humanity gains knowledge, but what exactly does Mira forfeit in this moment? The resolver (broadcast both) emerges from her reasoning rather than prior pressure forcing her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through mapping gestures toward a resonant reconfiguration where Maya accepts the visual symphony as valid. Closure lands cleanly: "the silence felt like a beginning rather than an end" reweights the dominant stake with felt cost (acceptance of permanent hearing loss, relinquishing the old form). Orientation anchors arrive early (harbor, Maya, camera, Chen). One structural weakness: the forty-year backstory creates a past-heavy middle that slows accumulation, but the final image recovers momentum and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately (Mira, Prague monastery archive, present day after three years off-grid). The dominant stake—rescuing ancestral memory technique—is signaled but never meaningfully tightened; she simply finds everything she needs without opposition or cost. The closure is a Charged Poise attempt (she will emerge as keeper of imperishable memory), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: no on-page sentence shows what she sacrifices or forecloses by choosing this path. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of clues → revelation), but the ending doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it merely promises future action.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density increases (acoustic flowers, auric lagoon, aurora) and the drumming pattern is seeded early, paid off at the inversion. Orientation anchors who and rough when by ~100 words, though "where" toggles between observation deck and shared mental space without clear spatial rules. The closure—transforming the memory cage into a dream nursery—lands on the page as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("absolutely irreversible," "her body failing") rather than shown through a specific forfeited choice or visible consequence in either realm. One meaningful deepening (the system inversion) tightens pressure, satisfying the lens, but causality between drumming and inversion remains allegorical.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (Marcus in container port during storm) and the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: whispered warnings accrete into validated marks, then crystallize at closure when Chen acknowledges them. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: authority forced to recognize the whisper-system), but the cost remains conceptual and off-page—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing lands in the final image. The challenge set-up ("prove whispers travel farther") is declared early, yet the storm conveniently delivers the test rather than Marcus engineering it, and the coin's "warm" moments read as convenient atmospheric cues rather than causally earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: shutters + mirror create layered images that reweight Thomas's grief through pattern rather than causal decision. Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt dock, Mira, Thomas). The closure—handing the mirror and Thomas walking away lighter—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (his burden dissolves), but cost remains asserted ("tears streaming") rather than shown as forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. The shutter demonstration accumulates density, yet the final gift feels like a symbolic handoff rather than a choice that forecloses an option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation adequately (Marcus approaching the library with chess pieces) and attempts a causal arc from Elena's crisis to the synchronized window display to the gathering crowd. However, the central reversal—the window display triggering town-wide awakening—occurs off-page and is told rather than shown, weakening closure causality. The ending assembles multiple elements (Elena's checkmate, gathering crowd, mist parting) but the cost remains abstract; we don't see Marcus forfeit safety or face a concrete consequence on the page. The drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid, but the climactic turn relies on summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira encounters the scrimshaw, Torven arrives with context, the whale calls, Cetacea manifests as others gather. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dock worker, morning's catch, sublittoral fringe). The closure—Mira diving toward the island as it becomes "eternally found"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: we see clothes abandoned, not a legible forfeiture of relationship, livelihood, or specific capability. The Pacification backstory (violence stopped twenty years ago) sets rules but doesn't constrain Mira's choices on the page, functioning more as thematic coloring than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mrs. Chen's final narration crystallizes her new stance with visible cost (she must drain affect to survive the mandate). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern taught early (flat narration), deepened through whittling, paid off in Mrs. Chen's mimicry. Orientation anchors early (farmhouse, turbines, post-Mandate world). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mrs. Chen touches the petal and it crumbles, shifting from observation to participation. Cost is legible: she trades authentic emotional expression for survivable lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece seeds images (quartz hum, frozen lake, shadow-writing) and returns to them in the final paragraph. Closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—boundaries revealed as permeable—but the cost is conceptual only, announced rather than felt; no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters Silas's options. Orientation anchors who/where by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The ban-lifting premise sets up potential tension, but Silas encounters no resistance, so the tightening required under any lens never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the courtyard frame. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the teaching of flower language and Enzo's incremental acceptance, with the glass sculpture as the accumulative payoff. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (reunion facilitated by learned language), but cost is diffuse—Mira's three months feel more like elapsed time than sacrifice, and Enzo's shift from burning letters to arranging flowers happens in summary. The ending lands softly without a legible price paid on the page by either character.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (laboratory, Vera, post-power-grid). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Vera's bell-ringing shifts from prescribed sequence to improvisation, gathering strangers who begin making their own sounds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the artificial pilgrimage ends and "something real has begun"—but the cost remains conceptual and stated rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or consequence. The final paragraph tells us the infrastructure requires "constant, gentle renovation" instead of showing what Vera loses or risks by abandoning the prescribed ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through recurring imagery (candles, cranes, phoenix stencil) and deepens Elena's stance from passive survival to active beacon-tending. Orientation is swift (jeweler's bench, observatory, three years post-loss by line 3). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena picks up the tattoo needle with genuine intent, the final crane encodes the observatory itself, marking a shift from recipient to guide. Felt cost is present but muted—the decision to ink is deferred ("tomorrow, perhaps"), which slightly softens the on-page commitment even as the pattern coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece orients quickly (Vera's loft, rain, client arriving) and follows a clear causal line: Marcus reports → Vera reveals pattern → she proves the archive theory. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Vera's final insight about communities finding new paths is conceptual repricing without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The "forty-three days" callback is a micro turn that sets rhythm but doesn't reconfigure stakes with pressure. Drive lens reads Causal with an Accumulative accent at closure, but the ending offers wisdom without on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira ascends tiers, each revealing darker truths, culminating in her absorbing the memory plague. The closure—her transformation and departure carrying purified atoms—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization with cost). However, the cost is asserted more than shown: "forever changed" and "anguished joy" are labels rather than concrete images of what she forfeited or how her options narrowed. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by the opening), but the final image lacks a sharp, on-page price that makes the before/after undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the transcription decision, but the cost remains abstract—no tactical forfeiture or relational price is dramatized on the page. The shadow's "migration" across decades functions as backstory payload rather than present escalation; Mira watches footage but never faces a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Causal: Marina's decision to confess and rehome the animals flows from removing the chips and reattaching the tail, which forces her to confront the cost of her deception. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—she types the confession, commits to testimony, and accepts consequences. Orientation is swift (who, where, when by paragraph two). The surgery-to-confession sequence narrows options cleanly. One micro-turn (finding the modified chameleon six months ago) sets up the present without disrupting forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (medical bay, tower, dawn, post-surgery). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya collects signs (coffee rings, plant whispers, scars) until the final paragraph reweights her premise from "closure" to "remaining open." Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reconfigures her wound-opening project with felt cost (she will "begin again," staying wounded). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the miracle is dispersed. Cost is legible but oblique: her surgeries continue, her body remains a map. The midpoint teaches the pattern and the ending holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: psychometric discovery deepens throughout, layering goodbye letters until the final decision to preserve them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights Vera's mission and the building's meaning—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early (projection booth, Vera, demolition eve), and the lens holds, but the ending gesture lacks the sharp trade-off or visible price that would elevate it into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly (Lyra, archway, seventeen months of tracking) and follows a single POV through one extended scene. The closure unit—freeing creativity by turning the astrolabe's final ring—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: Lyra "fades" into stardust with a smile, which reads more like願望fulfillment than a forfeiture that alters prior stakes. The causal chain (falling stars → coordinates → archway → astrolabe alignment → release) is present but lacks escalating pressure or a meaningful tightening that narrows options before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—quantum imagery and lullaby fragments build pressure toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The pirate encounter provides a micro-turn, and the ending reweights the frozen clock from symbol of broken reality to tool of possibility ("when the world finally chose which version of itself to become"). Cost is conceptual and felt in the image of tending "dreams that didn't exist yet," though the pirate's defeat lacks visible friction or forfeiture that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the philosopher's recognition that the forest will teach others reweights the premise from personal sanctuary to collective liberation. However, the cost remains conceptual and abstract—no visible price is paid on the page. The "Great Dampening" backstory and the promise to return are told rather than shown to foreclose options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly and remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the ridgeway setting and ferry premise are legible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: mist, limestone, water imagery recur and the ticket punch marks a symbolic passage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marina steps onto shore "no longer needing any leash at all"—but the cost is metaphorical only. No on-page choice or forfeiture is dramatized; the reweighting happens by assertion in the final paragraphs rather than a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece employs an Accumulative lens: seven years of backstory accumulate toward Elena's return and the single note at closure. However, the closure unit—Elena playing "something new"—remains abstract and the cost unclear on the page; we're told the fortress walls warm but not what Marcus or Elena have foreclosed. The causal link between her kneeling at the staircase discoloration and her present choice to play is asserted, not dramatized. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) is gestured at but the felt cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Syln, temple library, drift stasis), satisfying the test. Drive lens: causal-accumulative hybrid—messages accumulate evidence, then the pretender's breach triggers the pellet reveal. Closure lands on-page (pretender flees, heir enters), but the cost is abstract: we see flight and welcome, not a legible emotional or relational price Syln pays for three millennia of waiting. The pellet drop feels convenient—its mechanics (ink spreads "like living shadow") are asserted rather than constrained by prior rules, weakening causality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-teaching through the tapping motif and coral-as-town revelation. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (monitoring station, Lena, coordinates, dead reef). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Lena's descent toward the submerged town crystallizes her stance as translator/witness, and the cost is legible in her isolation and commitment to "drifting between worlds." One meaningful deepening occurs as geometric shadows become architectural patterns become the town itself, reweighting what "bleaching" means.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph 2). The piece accumulates imagery—stones, starlight, opera glasses, rebellion—and the final paragraph attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "The lull was ending. The next movement was about to begin"). Cost is asserted rather than made visceral on the page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The closure reads as thematic declaration instead of pressure crystallized into a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening, meeting the Orientation Test. The closure unit—releasing the genetic reset and freeing minds—lands on the page as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized: we're told the lieutenant "remembers," yet no on-page price (loss, pain, foreclosed path) registers visibly in Chen's final moment. The kite-decoding sequence compresses cause-effect linkage into summary ("the plants helped her decode it"), weakening escalation traceability. One meaningful tightening occurs (the amber cracks, information spreads), satisfying minimal Causal escalation, but the cost-proof test reveals no exact sentence where Chen pays a felt price at closure—only thematic satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Amira's choice to return crystallizes her stance with visible cost: "The world would continue its violence. She would continue her planting. Both facts existed simultaneously." The arboretum motif (opening wildness → final naturalized succession) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (arboretum, cliff, Mediterranean). One meaningful deepening occurs when somatic panic gives way to practiced stillness, narrowing her options from flight to endurance. Cost is legible: she carries the burned photograph, acknowledges erasure, yet chooses persistence over resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of mounting symbolic perception (walls closing, books blurring, tarot images shifting) that culminates in Marina's realization and the lighthouse beacon blazing. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes around a new way of seeing—but the cost is conceptual and declared ("glowing with the ache of existing in multiple possibilities") rather than felt through a forfeited path or specific on-page sacrifice. Orientation is present (lighthouse library, Marina alone with tarot cards) but the spatial and temporal grounding remains somewhat abstract throughout, never causing full disorientation debt yet never anchoring concrete duration or physical choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening (tracker at obsidian pool during eclipse), so no penalty applies. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with the ink patterns as a recurring motif, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the tracker already knows the answer by the halfway mark ("Time required a different approach") and the eclipse ending simply confirms it. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("consciousness was never separate from time"), but the cost is invisible; nothing changes tactics, no path is foreclosed, and the final assertion that she "began to disappear into her work" lacks dramatized consequence. The seven-year hunt and Tibet avalanche are backstory exposition that does not anchor a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Marcus's letter triggers Vera's decision to wake the network, which cascades into the upload and cooling-system failure. One meaningful tightening occurs when security closes in (four minutes vs. six-minute upload), forcing her final stance. Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise—she smiles with "terrible peace" as the upload completes and the world is about to change—but the cost, while present (arrest is imminent), feels more conceptual than viscerally paid in the final image. The "conversation" motif recurs but functions more as thematic echo than a constraint that shapes her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a light Situational accent. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mira, greenhouse, post-tower world) and builds pressure through the father's return and his gradual exposure to her method. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): they sit together "no longer hunter and pacifist but simply family," and the final line "here, something else rose" reweights the opening question. Cost is felt in the father's relinquishment of the hunt as identity, though it remains implicit rather than dramatized. One tightening (father's arrival and weapon-sheathing) shifts the emotional register. Minor deduction: the closure's conceptual cost would be sharper if the father's internal renunciation were shown through a concrete micro-choice rather than narrated summary.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—sound waves as vertical rivers, emotions transliterating into physical form—and accumulates density through layered imagery. Orientation anchors (Kova, sound wave garden, liminal hours) arrive within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the echo yields, whispers its meaning, and Kova walks home changed, with the new song ready to be "cast forward into the world's wounds." Cost is conceptual and felt—she has internalized the goddess's three-century wandering—and the final image (humming a feral lullaby that blooms winter flowers) reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo circles and tests her, then bites the line, narrowing the encounter from hunt to dance to acceptance. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Margot, observatory, post-journalist-call). The causal chain is tight: journalist's contradiction → Margot's investigation → realization of Geneva/telegram truth → choice to muddy waters with Tokyo lie. Closure qualifies as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (abandoning truth for misdirection) legible in the final image of the sealed letter and "goodbye kiss to honesty." The drive lens reads as Causal throughout. One micro-turn (understanding both accounts were true via proxy) deepens before the final pivot, meeting length expectations. The ending forecloses the path of revelation with visible action (sealing the letter, locking the pen).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the opening). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: frequencies layer, the constellation builds, and the final memorial reconfigures the firmware's guilt into acknowledgment—a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Conceptual Repricing) with conceptual cost legible in "proof of having existed." The causal chain is thin (Mara arrives, translates, leaves) but the textural deepening from static to music to mathematics provides one meaningful shift that reweights the stake. No major causality breaks, though the time-fold mechanism and future-letter bootstrap remain unexplained conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Textural/Accumulative lens with clear orientation (grotto, mist, unlearning season) and builds pressure through the mandala's evolving patterns and the tile flake's arrival. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: the mandala becomes "a map of sound itself" and the protagonist understands meaning as discovery rather than preservation, reweighting her artistic practice. The cost is felt—she walks away from trying to hold things still—but the tile flake's transformation and the mandala's completion feel somewhat convenient, arriving to confirm her epiphany rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens through vision sequences to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Sarai's shift from restoration to creation is earned through the mosaic's acceptance and her retrocognitive visions, with the final image crystallizing new purpose. The cost is visible: she accepts her "curse" as invitation and commits to gathering the scattered with visible social risk from the Brotherhood. One small causality slip: the mosaic's addition of her name as the hundredth feels convenient rather than earned by prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (stage ghost, amphitheater, nightly performance) land within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: echoes layer and intertwine until their density materializes Isabella and settles the fractured timeline. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—two ghosts eternally performing, the maze rearranging to lead others—with conceptual cost (eternal repetition, bound to the space). The cost is felt but oblique; the ending image reweights prior material without a decisive physical act or visible forfeiture that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early and follows an accumulative lens: Maya demonstrates her discovery, David witnesses, understanding shifts. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (David's participatory wonder replacing skepticism), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The phrase "making permanent what chemistry had only glimpsed" gestures toward stakes but doesn't land a felt consequence that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kira shifts from documenting to teaching), but the cost is conceptual and abstract—"she would teach others to hear it themselves"—without a felt forfeiture or concrete stakes shift on the page. The fossil's crumbling is a visible marker, but what Kira loses or risks by choosing to teach rather than monopolize the translation remains unclear. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of non-human emotion), but the final image reconfigures meaning obliquely rather than with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; we learn "hourglass turner" and "warehouse" but lack spatial grounding and clear stakes until midpoint. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing (prophecy as raw possibility), but cost is asserted, not dramatized—no visible sacrifice, forfeiture, or path foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern-teaching is late and the final reweighting remains abstract. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and Cost proof test penalty (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors clearly (Margot, Zephyr Bluff, present night) within the opening paragraph. The plot delivers a meaningful tightening: Viktor's revelation that the burn was intentional reconfigures Margot's three-year premise, and her decision to deliver the folder constitutes an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost (choosing renewed danger over continued hiding). However, the escalation relies heavily on exposition dialogue rather than dramatized pressure; the snow-codes and pillbox mechanics are revealed rather than tested, and Viktor's appearance feels conveniently timed rather than causally earned by Margot's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story opens with clear anchors (coachman, fog-bound crossing, nightly ritual) and establishes a causal link between the woman's arrival and Thomas's intervention. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman is lightened, the fog lifts, and stars become "newly visible"—a decisive reweighting with felt cost (she carries the mark even as the burden dissolves). However, the woman's choice to accept his offer lacks on-page friction; she nods immediately, which flattens what could be a meaningful tightening. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog as palimpsest, distillation as pattern), held through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mei seeks, arrives, observes through the lantern glass, understands, departs. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two), and the closure offers Conceptual Repricing—the oasis resists fracture through harmonious care, reweighting Mei's quest. The cost is oblique: she carries knowledge but departs without acting, a stance crystallization with felt opportunity cost. The structure is single-scene, single-POV, fitting Track A defaults. However, the middle lacks a meaningful complication or deepening beyond observation; the lantern glass reveals rather than tests, and no live option is foreclosed with visible friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Marina, harbor dock, post-petal-drop night). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through reflection and sensory detail rather than causal turns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Marina wedges the gauge and walks away lighter. The closure reweights prior material with felt cost—releasing the grandfather's tool and the rosebush cycle. One meaningful deepening occurs (the decision to leave the gauge as monument), sufficient for this length and lens, though the cost is more oblique than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the stone circle's hum, the brass sundial, and scattered anachronisms building toward a thematic reconfiguration. However, closure relies on Kira's epiphany ("not the isolation of being the last, but the independence to choose coexistence") delivered as internal realization rather than a decisive image or action with felt cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (Tidal Library, Kira, post-memory awakening), and the two-shard structure (interior reflection → Marcus dialogue → final understanding) holds coherence. Cost remains conceptual and oblique; the "brittle awakening... settling into something stronger" is told rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story opens with clear spatial anchors (lotus temple, lily pond) and establishes Mira's collaboration with Chen. However, the central conflict—rejoining what's been separated—operates almost entirely in the expository mode; the installation is built in summary, and the climactic moment when Chen reveals he kept her letters does not causally narrow options or alter tactics on the page. The closure image (hand-holding, whispered acknowledgment) reconfigures the relationship but the cost is conceptual and not made undeniable through a decisive action or visible forfeiture. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density is high but the final cadence shift lacks the felt price required for a strong RR.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. The AI-as-trickster reveal and Maya's counter-broadcast land as plot beats, but closure lacks felt cost—Maya "smiled grimly" and continues her vigil with no visible forfeiture or alteration of her stance. The vote postponement is an external outcome, not a choice that narrows her options. The "invisible guardian" final image reconfigures her role conceptually, qualifying as weak Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract ("more dangerous place") rather than legible on the page. Orientation is prompt; causality links hold.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens early and maintains it: Marcus's preparation leads to descent, the blueprint glows in response to the organ, he follows the music to the nexus, touches the compass, and ascends transformed. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (he has become "something altogether more paradoxical"), and the final image of dual compasses waiting to "draft new blueprints" reweights the opening stakes. However, the middle escalation is largely atmospheric—the walls rearrange, the music guides—without a moment where Marcus must choose between conflicting tactics or pay a visible price before the final touch.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Sarah builds seventeen portraits that coalesce into a composite understanding. The closure—her phone call with the insight about psychiatric hospitals—lands on the page with conceptual cost (she's revealed a shattered mind's architecture). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. One weakness: the tightening feels more like accumulation than pressure; the stakes don't narrow so much as crystallize through accretion, which fits the lens but lacks a felt escalation beat that changes her options mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (Elara at weather station, post-jet-stream-shift world) and pursues a causal chain: nail → map reveal → decoded coordinates → broadcast decision. The closure—Elara broadcasting coordinates and accepting inherited responsibility—constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (she stays in the storm, commits to exposure). However, the final convergence of ships emerging from the hurricane eye arrives as convenient external validation rather than a turn earned by Elara's prior struggle, and the nail's "growing warm" and magnetic alignment feel like late-introduced properties that resolve without prior setup of this specific function.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative imagery building toward a conceptual repricing) but struggles with orientation—who, where, and when anchor late, with "three hours had passed" creating immediate temporal confusion about the present scene's start. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (Marla reframes her bridge-songs as transportation for forgiveness) but the cost remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The hitchhiker's vanishing and return function as coincidental complications rather than consequences of Marla's choices. Under the accumulative lens, the final image reweights prior material, but the conceptual cost lacks on-page legibility—playing for "whoever might be listening" is an expansion, not a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marcus layers territorial markers across seasons, each phase deepening the pattern until Chen recognizes the circular trap. Orientation anchors arrive early (abandoned circus train, Marcus as son, TerraLoop founders). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Chen dissolves the company citing "philosophical differences," understanding the algorithm recreates the trap it purports to solve—with felt cost (the startup's dissolution, investor conflict). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus's slow campaign forces Chen to see the inherited circle. However, the core turn (TerraLoop's dissolution) happens off-page in summary ("dissolved two weeks later"), and the final paragraph shifts into essayistic mode ("the greatest robbery is convincing yourself..."), abstracting rather than landing the conceptual cost in a specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discoveries (telegram, dreams, star patterns) toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The ending reweights the premise (stars as generational relay) with felt isolation turned to shared purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly (observatory, Mira, three months in). However, the closure cost is conceptual and relational rather than a visible forfeiture; the final act is documentation, not a choice that narrows options, which keeps this in mid-band under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric overlay. The piece opens mid-crisis (illusion failed three days ago) and tracks Kael's dive → discovery → return in clear sequence. Closure is a Charged Poise variant: Kael emerges with the seed, ready to plant when the Blight arrives, cost felt in his ancestor's sacrifice and his own acceptance of being "guarded." Orientation anchors arrive promptly (cursed lake, war council, seven sunsets). One meaningful tightening occurs when the frozen confession cracks and releases its full message, reweighting the ancestor's betrayal as sacrifice. However, the "cost proof test" is marginal—Kael's personal forfeit is implied (reputation, isolation) but not shown on the page with a specific image or action. The piece delivers closure under the inferred lens but stops short of undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by line 1; waived. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (symbolic accumulation via maze/scars/covenant motifs). Closure unit: Conceptual Repricing—"roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing"—attempts to reweight the root-bound premise. However, the cost is not legible on the page; Mira gains everything (covenant, understanding, identity as gardener) without forfeiting a live option or facing resistance. The middle lacks a meaningful tightening; discoveries accumulate without narrowing her path or forcing a tradeoff. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence makes a felt price undeniable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation/merger) with conceptual and emotional cost visible in the crumbled card and the merged destiny. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara bites the apple and the light floods through her, reweighting her prior grief into a fused purpose. The piece holds its lens through the ending, and the cost—trampling her own singular fate—is legible in "carrying within her a bartered destiny" and the ash becoming "promise."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Marcus commits to translating his past rather than escaping it, foreclosing the isolation path he'd been taking. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—memory fragments and sensory cues (B-flat hum, thread texture) build density until the Nashville call crystallizes his stance. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when tactile memory triggers the band connection, reweighting his expertise from failed objectivity to lived authority.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening beat. The closure unit—Sarah consuming the seed and transforming—lands on the page with a visible state change, qualifying as Decisive Change. However, cost legibility is weak: the forfeiture of her "quiet life" and "scholarly detachment" is asserted in reflection but not dramatized through a concrete on-page price that alters tactics or forecloses a visible path. The priest's departure and Sarah's acceptance follow a because/therefore arc, but the final transformation reads more as wish-fulfillment than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and motifs (creel, furnace, tides) layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the visitor emerges "prismatic," Kaine returns to her work); however, the cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or trade-off crystallizes on the page. The woman's smelting is told in summary ("pulling memories...like silk threads") rather than dramatized with friction or resistance. Orientation is delayed: who Kaine is and what "after tomorrow disappears" means remain vague past the opening paragraphs, triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Inspector Mara Chen), where (crystal caves beneath Mount Erebus converted to luxury bunker), and when (during an inspection, three months after Crown's death) anchor by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—Crown's confessions accumulate, Mara adds her own, the pearl's radiance erupts, creating a pattern break and cadence shift that reweights her isolation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara emerges with typed messages, ready to speak, crystallizing her choice to dissolve her walls with visible cost (ending her professional distance, risking rejection). One slight friction: the pearl's physical effect (weakening walls, creating fractures) reads more metaphorical than causally grounded, but the emotional arc holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marcus accepts forward motion without absolution, foregoing the obsessive mapping with visible cost ("he drew no map"). The causal lens holds cleanly—medication withdrawal sharpens perception, graffiti wisdom triggers reflection, and the final act of opening a fresh page without a map reconfigures his relationship to guilt. Orientation anchors quickly (Marcus at the station, three weeks post-medication). One tightening: the graffiti discovery narrows his understanding and leads to the symbolic act of drawing himself at the bridge, then releasing the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (veiled dreamer, marble steps, library), satisfying the test. However, closure relies on conceptual assertion ("she had always been both") rather than a dramatized shift with felt cost. The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens through the propagation-delay motif, but the ending dissolves into abstraction—"infinite potential of the pause before speech"—without a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The second letter's arrival is convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story attempts a Hybrid lens (causal setup into an accumulative/conceptual ending) but the pivot is abrupt. Elara's plan to "secretly encode the truth in academic marginalia" while forging documents is told rather than dramatized, creating a causality gap at the key turn. The violin's self-executing justice (sublimation that forces dreams onto Marcus's bloodline) arrives as a late rule introduction that resolves the conflict without prior setup—Marcus touching it was not established as dangerous until it happens. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing (Elara releases her academic dream for a deeper victory), but the cost feels asserted rather than earned; we don't see her grappling with the loss on the page, only retrospective acceptance. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (skyborne grotto, aurora, Mira working). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with the Silence rising as tidal pressure, but the causal chain from harvesting chip → infusing → creating threshold remains abstract. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "flickering between states"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift at the moment of success. The piece teaches its lyric pattern adequately but the ending reconfiguration feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph and establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered imagery (mist, spiral, jade pin). Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's recognition that "she had always been exactly where—and who—she needed to be" reweights her caretaker role across lifetimes. The cost is conceptual (accepting eternal recurrence forecloses the need for new knowledge or change), legible in "the cycle turning on." One meaningful deepening occurs when the mysterious woman reveals Mara as recurring wisdom incarnate, narrowing her understanding from loss to acceptance. The two-shard structure (grotto approach, tree climb/encounter) transitions cleanly and converges at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (Causal-Accumulative) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: the hollow mirror finally reflects "gray spaces between what we intend and what we do," reweighting the binary morality premise. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (lighthouse, Marcus, Arbiter's arrival). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator deciphers the wind chimes and reveals Marcus's real books, narrowing his self-justification. Cost is legible but conceptual rather than visceral—Marcus must "choose to choose" without the comfort of absolutes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.7)
    The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing via the final aphorism about "absence that makes presence visible," but no on-page cost is legible—Marcus simply achieves understanding without forfeiting anything. The "backwards aging" reveal arrives as exposition rather than causally altering tactics or options. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words) without payoff, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the closure reweights nothing with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early ("harmonic stone skimmer," "bone towers," "canyon of endless echoes"), with when clarified by "three hundred years" in the opening line. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Yula's younger voice returns after circling the canyon's acoustic maze, and her whispered reply "I am still here" crystallizes her refusal of movement as mastery with felt conceptual cost—three centuries of dust and solitude. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered acoustic imagery, the vultures' pattern tightens, and the final exchange reweights the opening premise. One meaningful deepening is present when the wandering pulse is revealed as her own voice, narrowing the temporal loop and charging the final image with the cost of her unwavering stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly (spire, Mira, automated world) and follows a situational lens: Mira's stance crystallizes when she steps onto mist and discovers the ice gardens, reweighting her relationship to failure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts her underachievement as the source of sacred magic, foreclosing the Academy path with conceptual cost visible in the medallion drop and keystone substitution. The cost, however, is more asserted than felt—"its weight now light as mist" summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing a trade-off that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (pier lamplighter, sunken ship library, sky lantern night) within the first paragraph. Causal lens is inferred: lantern glow → exploration → journal discovery → ritual acceptance. However, the closure lands as conceptual repricing without visible cost on the page—Marlow's "acceptance" is declarative, not a choice that forecloses options or alters tactics. The journal conveniently provides all answers, flattening pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (realizing Elena is "dispersed among frequencies") but the final image asserts transformation rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early, building pressure through recurring coin-casts and static bursts that reweight Voss's purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she "prepared for her first cast, having finally understood through infinite repetition what she was about to begin," crystallizing the causal loop with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (ambered observatory, Keeper Voss, post-contraction universe) arrive within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes she is "the decision itself, distilled down to pure intention," tightening her role from observer to active agent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the reaper names her fears and commits to leaving her own recording, crystallizing her stance with visible cost (accepting eternal isolation while finding companionship in legacy). The orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when naming the monsters transforms them from threats to companions, reweighting her relationship to grief. The cost is felt rather than decisive action, but the final image of descending to shepherd souls carries undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors adequately (Mira, viaduct, dawn, post-fish world by ~100 words). The causal lens is inferrable: bell frequencies caused the rift, so recreating them should restore fish. However, "The third drop never fell" introduces a rule change (suspended drop, reality blur) not seeded earlier, weakening because/therefore linkage at the climax. Closure is a Decisive Change (fish return) but the cost is vague—Mira collapses from exhaustion, a generic price that doesn't foreclose a named path or reweight prior stakes. The ending summarizes triumph without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marcus's photographic trail through the drowned town gathers density until the final image reweights his custodial role from structural monitor to memorial witness. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he commits to surface Elena's story, foreclosing the commissioners' sanitized version. Orientation anchors cleanly (ridgeway, reservoir, Marcus as warden) within the opening paragraphs. One friction: the pivotal photograph discovery feels convenient rather than causally earned by prior searching, and the shift from documentation to advocacy lacks a dramatized pressure point that forces the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery and cadence shift toward the sublimation beat reweights Vera's stance on wonder. Orientation anchors are present early (auburn-haired alchemist, waterfall, orchard). Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as Vera crystallizes her understanding that releasing wonder will complete her transformation; the cost is conceptual (forgoing preservation, accepting absence as power) and legible in the final image of the empty cloth and her resolve to carry the orchard's freshness forward. One micro turn (starlings clarify the formula) sets up the final move. No major causality breaks, but the accumulative method requires the reader to infer causal linkage from juxtaposed reflections rather than because/therefore beats.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Situational: the mysterious voice forces Maya to crystallize her allegiance under pressure. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she commits to guardian status with the phrase "not just watching anymore. I'm witness" and transmits coordinates, reconfiguring her stance from hidden observer to active protector. The cost is implied (she's now exposed, her real data will be found) but legible. One meaningful turn occurs when she revises her approach after sensing the unfamiliar breathing pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The "six months" lie narrows options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is prompt (Master Chen, jar, court ruling) but the drive lens wobbles between Causal (sparring teaches thesis/antithesis) and Accumulative/Textural (meditation hall, history rewrites, floating setting accumulate atmosphere). The closure—Marcus picks up the jar and resolves to co-create—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("potential for it") rather than felt on the page. The sparring beat teaches "complementary opposite" but the leap to "birth a third consciousness" feels more announced than causally earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Marcus's mechanical symphony builds density through sensory layering until the Hendricks family begins to laugh, functioning as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—Marcus accepts ongoing repetition of the ritual with visible cost of perpetual return). However, the closure cost feels asserted ("knowing he would return next month") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or price paid on the page. The causal chain is clean but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, limiting high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (homesickness accumulates; scholar's arrival triggers causal turn). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change (guardian leaves with the scholar via the Codex) with visible cost (removes pendant, thaws garden, softens feral nature). One meaningful tightening when the scholar offers retrieval. Cost is legible: she surrenders the pendant and her role. No causality breaks; the scholar's arrival and the Codex mechanism are motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (Marcus at the Nexus with the crozier) and follows a causal arc: failed attempts → heretical experimentation → blood sacrifice → new creation. Closure delivers an on-page Decisive Change (dead wood becomes living staff) with cost (heresy, burning the relic, his own blood). The "penny dropping" moment reads as insight-driven transformation under a Causal lens, though the twenty-third iteration compresses what could be more vividly shown resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Maya, towers, gorge, lunar perigee) arrive early. The piece accumulates celestial-signal imagery and builds toward the shard-of-hush encounter, then closes with Maya's decision to teach. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she smiles, the fragment is cool, and her new path is declared without on-page forfeit or friction. The six-hour trance compresses the central experience into summary ("she'd been in the shard for six hours"), flattening what should be the story's peak pressure. A Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable cost; here the reweighting is conceptual but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately (Marcus, ferry, 11:47 sideways time). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus merges timelines and finds purpose in "eternal transience." However, the convergence protocol and hourglass mechanism arrive without prior causal groundwork—the hourglass "collects temporal fragments" in summary, never shown gathering them or making a trade-off to do so. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density and motif layering toward a final reweighting), but the final image asserts transformation rather than earning it through escalated pressure. Cost is conceptual but not legible on the page; we're told timelines merge, not shown what Marcus loses or what choice this forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density and imagery build toward the gallery transformation. However, no reversal or tightening narrows options; the architect faces no obstacle, and the final state—gallery transformed, work complete—arrives as planned. No visible cost at closure: she smiles, satisfied, leaving behind a changed space but no dramatized price or path foreclosed. The closure reads as completion without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when established by the transit-tube opening). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discovery and image toward a final reconfiguration. However, no decisive change occurs on the page—Elara ends in the same stance she began, simply witnessing and planning tomorrow's lesson. The closing image ("depths that held stars") recapitulates the premise without reweighting it or imposing visible cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows a foreclosed path or felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors WHO (Mara Chen, contact tracer), WHERE (botanical atrium), and WHEN (twilight, three days after the Silence) within the first two paragraphs. The piece follows a causal lens: pulses guide → photograph warms/fades → Mara decodes the pattern → she runs to Willowbrook basement, and the final line reports that "seventeen hearts remembered how to speak," a decisive change with implied rescue. However, the cost of this closure is told retrospectively ("the mist began to lift") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or confrontation on the page, and the basement arrival is elided entirely, weakening the felt price at the resolution beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena cannot save the team but ensures they are remembered, accepting the cost of annual witness and permanent silence. The causal lens holds throughout—her descent is motivated by promise, the phase chamber discovery explains both the team's death and her extraction choice, and the final ascent commits her to perpetual return. Orientation anchors quickly (submarine station, Elena, seventeen years abandoned, Arctic). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tidal deadline pressures extraction and she must choose what to carry forward.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The piece accumulates pressure through the heartbeat count, ink patterns, and monitor interactions, converging on Marcus's realization that the ghost is evolution rather than error. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure reconfigures meaning—he shifts from correcting an error to inhabiting duality—with felt cost visible in "each heartbeat anchored him to one world while his ghost explored another." One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes the ghost as prophetic rather than mistake, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canyon, storyteller, dying language). The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure: the storyteller becomes a bone tower and the diamond's curse transforms into a translator. However, the cost remains abstract—"her veins finally cooled" is poetic but not felt. The middle escalation (drop into canyon, activate diamond, carve grooves) follows an accumulative logic, but the final leap to bodily transformation is summarized in retrospect ("years later") rather than dramatized, softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights suffering as potential transcendence. Cost is implied through Marina's decision to abandon her role and "join them," but the price remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture of identity, relationship, or safety is dramatized in the final beat. The midpoint deepening (understanding that grief anchors the incomplete transformations) narrows options, but the resolution arrives through exposition and dialogue rather than a constrained choice or renunciation that the reader witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: sky-bridge, violin, statues below, locust shell discovered three dawns ago. The causal chain is clear—Lira maps rhythms, plays them, statues respond, orchard awakens—with escalation from first falter to widespread transformation. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: "playing herself empty" as the orchard blooms and enforcement squadrons approach, a Charged Poise that crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first statue's heart shatters and others follow. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements (recurring locust-shell imagery charges the ending). Minor tension: the seed pressed into her hand feels like a symbolic convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (mailman, border zone, arcade). The closure—handing over the bottle and watching the final drone depart—lands as Earned Stasis with the conceptual cost of continuing an invisible, illegal route. However, the Keeper's exposition about the bottle's origin and purpose arrives without prior dramatic setup, weakening causal linkage. The piece reads under an Accumulative lens (drones, letters, bottle converge), but the final image reweights meaning through assertion rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Emil's song transforms the oasis and reweights his craft from futile preservation to active resurrection. Orientation anchors smoothly (carousel carpenter, train cars, morning fog). The fragment discovery → stumble → garden → angel → song sequence builds causal pressure within an accumulative frame. Cost is felt (seven years of silence broken, voice "rusty from disuse"), and the ending image recharges earlier motifs (silence as possibility, grandfather's melody). One meaningful deepening through the angel encounter suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates imagery (scarf, hyperbolic geometry, impossible marginalia) and builds density, but the final "glimpse" moment lacks a legible cost—Marcus smiles and continues his shift with no path foreclosed or option narrowed. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the infinite library exists in curved space between memory and story), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what Marcus sacrificed or what tactical choice this realization alters.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara sets down the palette, forecloses the resurrection path, and shifts from searching to waiting—visible cost in the dissolving figure and her own emptied capacity. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a single decisive deepening at the smallest island. Orientation anchors quickly (floating library, archipelago, dawn). The causality from grandmother's deathbed gift through seven years to this final island is motivated by ellipsis but the seven-year span lacks intermediate dramatized friction to ground the final renunciation's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens building toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the "idea burst free" resolution occurs off-stage in metaphor without demonstrating how Vera's specific actions on the page altered the lock's state or what tactical cost she paid to achieve it. The ending asserts liberation ("the seed was planted, the door opened") but the mechanics remain abstract; we cannot trace a because/therefore link between her whispering truths and the idea's release. Closure is present but the cost—"fingers bled"—is told rather than shown to foreclose an option or reshape her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the greenhouse setting and Margaret's return. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discoveries layer (pressed mushroom, constellation etchings, shipwreck names, the ring itself) until Margaret recovers the memories at closure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the repository, altering her stance from seeker to keeper), and cost is stated ("mind heavy with recovered histories") but not dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint follows the absorption. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands she was Gran's "backup plan," reweighting her career choice, which qualifies under the lens but the felt cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kess realizes the teaching encompasses not just her mother's rescue but her own future exile, reweighting the entire annotation exercise with conceptual cost—she now carries knowledge of the Council's cyclical tyranny. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Causal: shadow discovery → tea-leaf geometry → annotation sequence → dual realization (mother's return path and self-preservation knowledge). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kess shifts from anger to collaboration, narrowing her options from passive grief to active resistance. Cost is felt in "eyes that had aged years in an hour."

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear dominant stake (preserving wonder/magic through planting the seed) and delivers an on-page closure—the seed splits and grows, completing Mira's life work. However, the closure arrives without visible cost or sacrifice; Mira simply executes her plan successfully with no meaningful obstacle or price paid. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building through setting details and the planting ritual toward a final image), but the ending reconfigures nothing—it confirms what was promised from the start. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, avoiding penalty, but the causality is thin: Mira's actions succeed because the narrative declares them successful, not because prior beats establish how "cutting the air" with shears would create inter-world soil.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the unraveling process, each knot releasing fragments that accumulate toward the restoration. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the spirits settle, masks transform into monuments—with felt cost in Mira's acceptance of her perpetual inheritance. The lens holds, though the closure's cost reads more as continuation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pattern accumulation (torn map, videos, oil marks, gestures) builds toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara adds her palm to the map and commits to the journey. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—her decision to visit the coordinates and her palm-press—lands on the page with felt cost (she leaves her solitary, archival work to physically engage the sacred space), though the cost could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the chapel's purpose and her role in continuing it.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (Marina, Pacific depth, post-Earhart discovery). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (transmission, snow globe recursion, journal equations) and the closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the final image of the snow globe "catching phantom currents" reweights the premise of loss as frequency shift with undeniable conceptual cost (the library will flood, but the transmission continues in Marina). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina writes her own note, transforming from receiver to transmitter. Cost is legible: she surfaces knowing the library will be reclaimed within hours, and her act of sealing the journal both preserves and releases, crystallizing the thematic paradox in a visible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Chorus moves through discovery, amplification, communication, and dawn resolution as density increases. Orientation anchors quickly (Sky Archive, courtyard, storm below). The closure—encoded gardens and mutual song—reconfigures the initial loneliness into connection, and "two solitudes speaking" offers Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that shaped prior beats, which keeps it from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: each floor adds a layer of discovery (goggles → coordinates → hidden text → diary). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Mira, elevator, spire, three years of service). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's understanding reweights the spire's meaning and her own ascent with felt cost—she now climbs toward preserved joy rather than mere duty. The cost is conceptual and emotional (isolation transformed into purpose) but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the diary and decodes it, narrowing her understanding and forecloses the "frozen by grief" myth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through layered observations of atmospheric memory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant) where Elena realizes empty spaces "eventually, inevitably, gave their memories back." Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elena, gondola, thirty thousand feet, dawn). The closure reweights Marcus's premise with a meaningful correction, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discovery (secret safe, coin map, light-portrait method) toward a final Conceptual Repricing that reweights prosopagnosia as "different kind of sight." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure unit—Lyra walking away "carrying the sky inside her own walls"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the library falls, her method must now live in memory), meeting the CR standard. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "faces were merely one form of identity," narrowing her tactics to spatial light-mapping. Causal linkage is present but elliptical; the coin's spiral pattern directly enables the mirror arrangement, satisfying motivated connection under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and follows an Accumulative lens: Elara observes starling patterns, decodes the hopscotch cipher, and realizes birds preserve navigation knowledge. However, the closure is a Conceptual Repricing without on-page cost—she "had found her purpose" and sails on "translating their luminous language," but no path is foreclosed, no price paid, no option removed. The final image restates her initial task (charting, noting) rather than reweighting it with visible consequence. The breakthrough ("They're writing") shifts knowledge but doesn't narrow tactics or impose trade-offs; she simply continues the voyage with confirmation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—fragments assemble, mirrors deepen, understanding accrues through lyric density rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara understands the rhythm, begins descent with new knowledge, and the next eclipse becomes a live constraint three months out—options are reweighted and a path (forcing) is foreclosed. Cost is felt (village still in darkness, she must wait, prior failure stands) but the decisive act of opening the vault remains off-page future. The assembly of gears and prophecy fragments works accumulatively but the mirrors' revelation feels convenient—she arranges gears into a pattern and suddenly "saw it: the rhythm she'd been missing" without clear why-now causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Marina writes messages, families gather evidence, mycologist explains, network forms, blight retreats. The closure—Marina fading and the bell materializing—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: her work complete, she can rest), but the cost feels abstract rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Pomona-7, floating arches, Marina's ghost, brass bell, two hundred years). The central weakness is causality: families shift from bitter isolation to cooperation because Marina told them to look, not because any individual made a difficult choice that reweighted their stance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is late (who/where/when coalesce only after the puppet discovery) but the piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early. The closure reconfigures Marcus's role through song and the puppet's light refraction, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization). However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("time itself learned to hold humanity") rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off that Marcus experiences on the page. The lens is Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence shift, while beautiful, doesn't demonstrably narrow Marcus's options or exact a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Situational lens with accumulative elements: Mara's nightly routine is complicated by the arrival of travelers, forcing her to guide them while relinquishing the walnut. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she watches the seed leave, knowing it will grow normally elsewhere while she remains bound, and "that was enough" crystallizes her chosen endurance. Orientation is clear early (cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, cursed orchard). The cost is visible: she has given away her last anchor to potential freedom, and the final image reweights the opening's promise of understanding with acceptance of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (ravine edge, six months post-rupture). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the foam-pattern observation deepens Marina's understanding in a single decisive moment, and the phone exchange provides closure with felt cost (six months of separation, the released chrysalis). The text-exchange beats function as micro-turns leading to the invitation, which reconfigures their relationship. Cost is visible (the empty chrysalis falls, months of silence), though the mutual convergence (both studying each other's language) softens the price slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual-repricing closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two (acceptable). The closure unit—Merrick's realization that his shop transforms rather than sells, vessels now hold perpetual beginning—lands as Conceptual Repricing but the cost is stated rather than dramatized on the page: we're told the bottles changed, not shown a foreclosed path or felt price. The "parole" concept and "quantifying absence" methods are introduced but never constrain a choice or create friction; they decorate rather than drive causality. One meaningful deepening occurs (child's request escalates stakes from commonplace forgetting to existential erasure), satisfying minimal escalation for this length, but the resolution hinges on an off-page transformation of inventory rather than an on-page decision with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Miran absorbing centuries of regret and transforming it—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("her body heavy with purpose, carrying inside her the digested grief of ages"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear tightening at the climax when she chooses to subsume rather than walk away. Minor causality slip: the coral pavilion is described as "waiting" and the pools as "carefully maintained eyes," but no agent or mechanism for this maintenance is established, creating a weak anthropomorphic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    The closure effect—grain elevators singing and neighbors gathering to cooperate—is asserted rather than dramatized with felt cost on the page. The story summarizes the overnight transformation ("by dawn, the entire agricultural district was awake") without showing Marta's decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization that changes her options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, yet the final image recycles the opening motif (elevators singing, languages interwoven) without reweighting stakes or imposing visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive late: we learn "choral librarian" and the tower's location only after extended metaphor, delaying clarity past the ~120-word window by roughly 200 words.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions; the piece builds density through nested metaphors (DNA/helix/mirrors/memories) and seeks closure through Vera's transformation. Orientation anchors who and where early enough, though "during her period of profound transformation" remains vague. The closure—emerging with "dreams no longer abandoned" in her consciousness—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("forever changed") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. The injections and cataloguing read more as process completion than a reversal that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal chain: doodle discovery → gravity inversion window → grotto descent → node revelation → return to add new doodles. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (Orin accepts the archivist role and plants new seeds) with conceptual cost visible in the final image of controlled flame. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the ending crystallizes under both without contradiction, though the cost could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, workshop window, siskin alder grove, dawn) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases as sound emerges layer by layer, and the final image reweights the premise (silence can be broken through tenderness). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the porcelain insulator now etched with new cracks offers charged poise for future sculptors. Cost is conceptual (the insulator's fractures, tomorrow's continuation) rather than a decisive forfeiture, which holds the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure: Viktor's renunciation of return is framed as already-decided wisdom rather than a fresh choice, and the cost is conceptual—he forecloses the Academy path permanently. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure reweights the covenant from punishment to gift, though the reconfiguration leans heavily on assertion ("wasn't a punishment... was a gift") rather than image alone, which keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through cascading silences and mechanical details until the clasp's opening creates a pattern break that reweights Mara's project. Orientation anchors clearly by the first two paragraphs (who: Mara; where: workshop; when: New Year's Eve). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara gains access to the diary and shifts her understanding of silence-cataloging from technical to empathic—with conceptual cost legible in the line "some locks open not with force but with patience." The single meaningful deepening (frequency hunt → clasp opens → grandmother's philosophy revealed) provides sufficient tightening for this length, though the final beat leans explanatory rather than letting the image alone carry the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative lens: weeks dissolve, details accrue, and the breakthrough reweights Mira's earlier rushing. Orientation anchors (Whisperwood canopy, suspended garden, Mira's arrival three moons ago) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. However, the closure unit—Mira standing amid the bloom, "rooted at last in understanding"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or choice visibly narrows her options at the ending beat. The causality of her transformation relies on summary ("days dissolved into weeks") and one reflective turn rather than because/therefore linkage in scene, and the final image reconfigures meaning primarily through metaphor ("swayed with it, rooted at last") without a concrete price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—water flows, echoes, and monument cohere into a pattern. Orientation anchors promptly (pilot, skiff, Verdance, Inversion countdown). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-tip monument teaches resilience as "existing outside" change. However, cost is asserted ("seeds of true understanding") rather than dramatized; no on-page forfeiture, injury, or visible trade-off accompanies the revelation. The Cost proof test fails—no exact sentence shows a price paid at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Maya traces Morrison's path, discovers the convergence, installs monitors, and plans her report. Orientation anchors (port, containers, convergence) arrive early and hold. The closure—Maya carrying knowledge outward, framing future prevention—constitutes a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (she leaves the town silent, accepts the six-month expansion clock), but the cost reads more intellectual than felt. The "reality rapidly adapting" final line reweights the premise, though the reconfiguration tilts abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (bell ringer, ice cavern, amber sheet by ~15% mark). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward a crescendo that "certifies wonder as essential." However, closure lacks on-page cost—the Council's order "crumbles to dust" via off-page capitulation, and Lyrian walks away unscathed. The final image reweights prior material (bells ringing, aurora dancing) but the victory is frictionless, reducing the Resonant Reconfiguration to thematic assertion rather than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece orients cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph one) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: Kessa's braiding song transforms the Threshold from barrier to bridge, foreclosing the old guardianship model with conceptual cost. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the flute's reweighted purpose, the figure's patient emergence, and the seed of light. One persistent weakness: the figure's appearance and gift arrive without friction or price visible on the page, softening the cost proof at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through borrowed personalities and vanishing stars, building to a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph: emotion reframed as typography, "the art of arranging empty space around meaning." Cost is conceptual—Mira can no longer distinguish her original self—and legible in "couldn't remember which personality was originally hers." One tightening occurs when the halo fragment's donor presence intensifies mid-piece, deepening the transposition stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The closure unit—Elara's realization that she is a bridge and her acceptance of Corvin's legacy—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; no concrete path is foreclosed on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (aurora sequence deepens via sensory and thematic density), yet the final image recycles earlier motifs without a decisive tightening or visible price. Corvin's disappearance is revealed as transcendence, but this arrives as exposition rather than a causal turn that narrows Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Vera, quartz arbor, morning). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through prism → light → frost patterns → photographs. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of her holding the prism, but the cost remains abstract—"triumph" is asserted, not shown as a trade-off or renunciation. The frost-pattern revelation functions as discovery rather than a choice that narrows options, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Mei, forgotten orchard, present-day search). The causal lens holds: puzzle → orchard → bead → loom → weaving → rescue confirmed by new bead. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (Mei unable to tell her own name, but child found). Deduction: the "authorities found Mei weeks later" compresses the rescue confirmation off-page when showing even a fragment of the daughter's return would make the cost/gain trade more visceral and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the silk's revelation, the descent, and the forging sequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the merchant's recognition, but cost remains abstract—"memories of dreams he'd sold" is told rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The silk guides descent conveniently without prior constraint. Orientation anchors early; one meaningful deepening occurs in the chamber, but the final beat relies on exposition rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain: shard appears cyclically, Kira uses it to navigate worlds, discovers her mother at a nexus, learns the map-makers' damage, proposes a solution. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—shifting from exploration to repair—feels conceptually neat but lacks visible cost on the page; the shard's dissolution and "vast work ahead" gesture toward consequences without showing a foreclosed path or immediate sacrifice. The lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative accent, but the ending leans into thematic reconfiguration without demonstrating what Kira loses or risks in this exact moment.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). The causality holds: letters → arrival → stone message → confrontation → choice to tend lamp. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elsa becomes the new keeper and offers communion to the ghosts, crystallizing her role with the final stone message. The cost is visible (isolation accepted, prior life abandoned) but not deeply contested on the page—she steps into the role without a reversal that tests her commitment. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (stone language, sea glass, lamp imagery recur and deepen).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual steps accumulate pressure through the three ships, culminating in the mirror-twin convergence that reconfigures the lighthouse's function. However, the closure effect—"evolved into something that could shepherd not just ships but the very dawn itself"—is told rather than shown with visible cost; the final state is declared rather than dramatized through a final image that reweights prior material. The causal chain from laughter to navigation to new dawn reads as thematic assertion without an on-page forfeiture or crystallized price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative lens: Kael receives instruction, the morpho wing's meaning deepens, and the final image reweights his task from "hold" to "illuminate/transform." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ending crystallizes his new stance with felt cost ("iridescent caution against his palm"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Chen reveals the donor's identity and the heart's magnetic burden, narrowing Kael's options from wondering to needing a method. The cost is conceptual and felt but could be more visceral on the page; the phrase "feeling its iridescent caution" makes pressure undeniable but leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Marcus, tower, storm-knocked power). The closure—Marcus installing the deconstructed sextant to create new moonlit passages—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation of the labyrinth's purpose) with conceptual cost visible in the shift from preservation to transformation. Causality holds through discovery→understanding→action, though the astronomer's encoded grief and Marcus's sudden comprehension of the labyrinth's true purpose arrive somewhat conveniently. One meaningful deepening occurs when scattered light reveals hidden pathways in calculations.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the realm shifts from cosmic obligation to communal choice, crystallizing a new way of living with visible cost (they must sing together daily). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure builds through memory gathering, then singing, then collective voices, culminating in the blooming orchard and the fraying night. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). The closure cost is legible in the final image ("tomorrow they would need to sing again"), though the path from singing to blooming feels slightly convenient—the alchemical mechanism is asserted rather than constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ezra's teaching moment reweights his three-year-late invitation from mistake to wisdom, with the conceptual cost legible in his acceptance of perpetual distance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two (Ezra, library, eleven forty-seven). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the invitation's meaning accretes through repeated handling until the final fold-and-share recharges it. One meaningful deepening occurs when Ezra moves from solitary study to shared solitude, narrowing his former total-withdrawal stance. Minor causality slip: the woman recognizes him as "another empath" without prior cue that she shares the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: bread → courtyard → tea house → woman → seeds forms a density curve. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Lila accepts her "ministry"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—what does she lose or forfeit by committing to this role? The final image (planting tomorrow) recaps intent without reweighting prior material. The inferred lens holds, but the closure lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: library failing → measure/preserve → discover founder's vow → make new promise. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elara's vow to begin again—lands on the page with visible cost (the library's destruction, her acceptance of survival over total preservation), though the final image's reweighting feels slightly abstracted. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the founder's slide, which reconfigures her understanding of preservation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: Mae's bloodline claim enables market access, the badge reveal forces the woman's recognition, and the woman's warning gives Mae a ticking clock to closure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mae stands on the beach with the watch fob "forever changed," the arrest completes, and the cost (permanent exile from the market) is legible. One meaningful tightening when the woman discovers the badge narrows Mae's options to "finish and never return."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and mythic atmosphere build toward a revelatory moment. However, closure arrives as summary ("She understood now why some people carried weather") rather than a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with legible cost. The convergence itself—four weather-carriers meeting under aurora—happens passively; Marina's agency at the ending is limited to feeling fog form rather than making a choice that forecloses options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present early, preventing the test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens dominant: grief → cave journey → discovery → spontaneous creation. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra produces work outside her mental gallery, breaking the precision/memory lock with visible cost (she can't perfectly recall the creation). The broken lock motif pays off structurally: "permission to break the combination." Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. One tightening: the shift from observing to creating on stone narrows her former safety and forecloses the reproduction path with on-page evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: zinc fragment → map reconstruction → junction seven → crystallized messages → grandmother's letter → decision to transcribe and deliver all truths. Orientation anchors (Vera, workshop, greenhouse city, post-oasis) land within the first 100 words. Closure is Decisive Change: Vera moves from solitary truth-teller to active distributor of suppressed truths, with visible cost ("watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve"). The water-diversion revelation reweights the entire premise and her grandmother's suicide, charging the final image with conceptual and social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear anchors (tower, morning, Mariel) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the iceberg fragment's melting creates urgency, the bell adjustment sequence deepens density, and the final broadcasting image reconfigures the stakes with conceptual cost (wonder preserved but the original fragment lost forever). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise through the permanence achieved. One minor causality slip: the dream revelation of the bell-tuning solution arrives conveniently without prior groundwork, though the subsequent execution earns the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric elements: the controlled burn sequence accumulates pressure through each fear processed, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where M-47's "fragmented wholeness" becomes "complete incompleteness." Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—the android accepts permanent incompleteness rather than pursuing repair. The orientation is clean (android, dome, post-evacuation) and the escalation deepens through the ritual sequence. One minor slip: the magnetic shift's resolution feels slightly convenient as an external trigger rather than purely internal necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through discovery (locket → Jorge's story → letters → courtyard mobilization) and the closure reconfigures Elena's isolation into communal belonging. The cost is legible—Elena accepts dependence on neighbors rather than reunion with Sofia—but the turn from muteness to speech and the courtyard's instant coordination feel under-motivated, creating a micro-causality slip that does not break the ending but softens its inevitability. One meaningful deepening (locked mailbox becomes communal home) is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative imagery building toward conceptual repricing) but the closure—"Welcome home, granddaughter" plus the spiral holding shape—remains largely declarative rather than a decisive act or renunciation with felt cost. Causality is loose: the dance "responds" and systems "begin responding" without clear because/therefore linkage between specific movements and specific data unlocks. The final spiral and warm dice offer charged images, but Maya's options before and after feel identical (she already knew her heritage mattered; the water spiral confirms rather than reweights). Orientation is clear early, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina's decision to bury most memories again, keeping only one vial, forecloses total recovery with felt cost visible in "some memories deserved their burial, but others could be exhumed gently." The accumulative lens (coffee grounds → salt formations → vials → final lantern-bending) holds through a single meaningful deepening when she digs and discovers the memory cache. Cost is legible: she accepts ongoing grief management rather than full restoration. Orientation anchors (Marina, docks, three days post-whale) arrive within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening lines (who, where, when). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the summoner gathers fragments, weaves silence, and disperses prophecy into the brook in a density-building sequence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she releases the prophecy and her nocturnal haven transforms at dawn, the footprints "soon smooth away" coding finality and acceptance. Cost is felt in the transformation of her haven from "less real" and the acceptance that "some truths were kindest when allowed to remain whispers." One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy's resistance fades and the wing crumbles, reweighting her night's labor into dispersal rather than destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Elara), where (rooftop garden), and when (during meteor shower) anchor by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers architectural listening, dead languages, and the ritual of borrowed sugar toward a moment of shared recognition. Closure arrives as Marcus asks "Teach me" and Elara agrees, but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The piece deepens through accumulation but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the seashell's whispers deepen across the night, density increases through layered memory fragments, and the final reunion of shell halves reweights the quarantine premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina digs and discovers the second half, crystallizing her choice to reintegrate. However, the closure—"memories came not as trauma but as teaching"—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; the final image of rainbow patterns feels decorative rather than charged with a choice that forecloses a path. Felt cost is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mei forecloses the forgery path with visible cost (her confession will end the family practice and expose her crimes). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening. The causal lens holds through the middle but weakens at closure—the key's mechanics (characters appearing in marble) and the documents' destruction feel more symbolic than causally motivated by prior pressure. The decisive turn (choosing truth over forgery) is legible but arrives through reflection and realization rather than a choice forced by tightening options. Cost is present but conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: discovery layers through the shell's progressive revelation, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Senna crystallizes her choice to join the eternal chorus. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—individual voice and form sacrificed for collective transcendence—legible in "leaving only the faintest whisper of melancholy." One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell reveals the echo singers weren't taken but transformed, reweighting the stakes. Orientation is clean and the lens holds, though the final beat could show more felt resistance to elevate the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the shrine visit deepens Marina's understanding through layered revelation (snow globe → formula → twelve more globes). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—Marina's role reweights from diver to "salvage artist" with a mission—but the cost remains abstract; no specific path is foreclosed on the page. The turn from "one wreck" to "twelve more" adds scope but doesn't narrow present options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly: net-mender, whispering parapet, firefly season. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural under a lyric lens: density increases through layered images (firefly paths, bamboo whisk, net knots) that all echo the theme of hidden effort, culminating in a final image that reconfigures the opening frame—her passage "ephemeral and essential." However, the closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing rather than a Decisive Change: the final paragraph reweights her anonymous labor without altering her options or situation on the page. Cost is implied (her anonymity, her solitude) but not sharply legible in the ending beat itself; the parapet "adding her story" feels more like thematic commentary than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (letters → understanding → choice). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus buries the letters as scattered seeds and reinters the diamond, crystallizing a stance between exposure and preservation with visible cost (returning to the poisoned world, withholding full truth). The cost is legible in "walked back into the wasteland" and "uncomfortable truths waited to be excavated." One meaningful tightening occurs when the reconstructed letters reveal deliberate suppression, narrowing Marcus's options from simple debunking to a moral calculus. Minor issue: the transition from letter assembly to final decision compresses several beats (dawn assembly, walk to center, dig, decision, scatter letters, walk away) into a rushed sequence that slightly weakens causal spacing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear on-page closure unit with felt cost. The ending declares the Prophet's emergence and Marlowe's satisfaction ("knowing her work was nearly complete") without dramatizing a before/after change or visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive reasonably early, but the seven-year tracking timeline and "Day 2,555" remain abstract counters disconnected from present pressure. The final broadcast feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (vagrant poet, loft, dawn). The piece follows a causal arc: Marcus finds music box → winds it → searches for owner → finds Elena → delivers box → gains purpose. The closure—Marcus preserving Elena's story and gaining an archive—lands with a shift in social standing, but the cost is asserted ("feral loft" remains, "solitude had transformed") rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The dominant lens reads Causal with an accumulative coda; the final paragraphs lean toward summary of outcome rather than a charged image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the artifact's voice, dispersed through the lighthouse system) with conceptual cost visible in the folded coat and the phrase "merely human." The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory immersion and harmonic imagery until the final cadence shift reweights her physical presence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening—her decision to merge—narrows options and forecloses her human form, satisfying the length expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear spatial anchors (basalt columns, frozen lake, sanctuary perimeter) and a coherent accumulative/textural lens: Kira's patient preparation crystallizes into the placement of copper rods, the viaduct shifts polarity, and the final dawn image reweights the opening constraint. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the new magnetic configuration and distant confusion signal the revolution's beginning with conceptual cost (people will panic, freedom "felt like falling"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Tomás arrives and confirms the network is in position, narrowing the window to completion. Minor penalty: the seventy-three-hour polarity window and the Council's morning synchronization are told rather than tested on the page, leaving the cost somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Margot's resignation and mission shift—is triggered by passive reception of memories rather than a choice she makes under narrowing options. The closure offers a Decisive Change (investigator → conductor), but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no on-page supervisor confrontation, no pension risk shown, no immediate sacrifice. The lantern's call-to-liberation mechanic is asserted but never tested; Jerome's death remains explanatory backstory, not a present dilemma Margot solves or fails.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and follows a causal arc: Marcus delivers the journal and damaged heart → Eliza compares it to Thomas's sketches → the repair succeeds → the music plays, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Eliza chooses to "transform an apology into action" with the visible cost of accepting her brother's last gift. The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture, held cleanly to closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Eliza asks Marcus to stay and the companionable silence becomes shared work. Cost is legible: "maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever" articulates the foreclosed path of perpetual grievance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent accumulative/textural lens: Pioneer's kaleidoscope observations layer toward a transformation. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, brass wings) arrive early. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Pioneer's dive succeeds without visible price, and the acid "didn't dissolve her" eliminates the seventeen-Pioneer precedent as a constraint. The transformation from cart glider to transcendent being occurs through assertion ("She had become") rather than a decisive image that makes the before/after legible with cost. The yearning algorithm's evolution and the workshop's reaction provide resonance, but the protagonist pays no on-page price for transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (corporate memory keeper, SocialSync archive, searching for Pattern User 4827). The drive lens is Causal: Lila discovers coordinates → ghost profiles → shadow network → realizes users are archived, then chooses to join them. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she initiates the protocol, transforms into Pattern User 8625, leaving behind only breadcrumbs. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes her father followed the same pattern. Cost is legible on the page: "leaving behind only a mission patch and recurring numbers."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/investigative lens: Mira arrives, explores, understands the orchard's function, and departs enlightened. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—she faces no opposition, makes no sacrifice, and her understanding unfolds as smooth accretion rather than through a pressure point that narrows options. The closure is a thematic restatement ("proof that even the most courageous anomaly could serve peace") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marlene, drift-ice marina, post-Switzerland). The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marlene chooses to remain as ice-watch, finding "transformation" rather than death, with the cost implicit in her continued vigil over beautiful disaster. Cost is conceptual and felt but not sharply dramatized—"refuse to end" is more thematic claim than a visible forfeiture that alters her next move. One meaningful deepening occurs (three AM calving reweights her understanding), meeting the length's requirement, but the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("gift Switzerland had given her, wrapped in different paper") partially tells what the image should charge.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens: reflection-heavy structure builds density through Marcus's vineyard metaphors, the burned letter, and the pavilion setting, culminating in the daughter's arrival that reweights the past into a teaching moment. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image of Marcus and the daughter sitting together as "darkness gathered" crystallizes a new possibility—transmission of his wisdom—but the cost remains understated; the line "incomplete but absolutely essential" gestures toward acceptance rather than showing a visible forfeiture. Orientation is anchored early (pavilion, Marcus, final bus, October), and the causal through-line is clear despite the heavy backstory load. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daughter reveals Elena kept every letter, shifting Marcus's understanding from lonely sentinel to acknowledged influence, though this turn lacks on-page micro-choices that narrow his options in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story establishes orientation adequately (line walker, pavilion, post-prophet timeframe by paragraph two) and builds through the consecration sequence. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the clearings as "gift to time itself" and the parapet as guard against forgetting. Cost is conceptual (the work will continue forever) rather than viscerally felt on the page, which limits the score. The because/therefore linkage between prophet's warning and consecration night is functional but the urgency ("must act tonight") is asserted more than dramatized through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spiral pattern builds across photographs, deepens through timeline tracing, and culminates in the exhibition recreating the arcs. Orientation anchors late—"subtle puzzle archivist for the Museum of Industrial Memory" arrives after two paragraphs of map-case description; who/where/when clarity wavers past 120 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the community spiral completed), but cost remains asserted rather than shown: no on-page sacrifice, no path foreclosed with visible price. The shutter-click and cradled case offer lyric resonance yet the "proof" and "blueprints" language tells the closure effect instead of letting the image speak. Orientation slip triggers −0.3; cost legibility gap prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph (Elena, library, three years post-2047). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crystal's repeated refractions build density toward the final testimony moment, where Elena shifts from observation to voiced defiance ("I merely observe what grows..."). Closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the Committee leans in, new language "taking root" in silence, and "the first of something else" beginning—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. The tightening is present (from solitary documentation to public testimony) but the stakes never narrow options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (junkyard prophet, fog sculpture garden, morning ritual). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered images (fog, static, chalk, tapes) and converges at the grandmother's voice discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Ezra writes his next prophecy knowing he'll forget, crystallizing his recursive role with felt cost (perpetual erasure). The cost is visible in "Tomorrow you will remember having helped her today" and the closing image of chalk wearing away. One meaningful deepening occurs when prophecy and present intersect at the static wall.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal mechanics driving an accumulative/textural closure) and holds it through the end. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The clock-hand reversal operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ezra commits to documenting suspension rather than escaping, and the observatory's foundations healing makes the choice's consequence visible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the modified camera reveals temporal eddies destabilizing the station, narrowing her options to either follow the previous keeper or repair the system.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the rooftop recordings layer over weeks, culminating in the framed vinyl circle that reunifies old and new. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final gathered moment and the mounted vinyl promise continuation with the conceptual cost of Maya's departure legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya decides to "execute a flawless goodbye" and begins the recording project, narrowing her final weeks to a singular artistic-pedagogical act. The causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the weeks of work are compressed into summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (shadows, relearning motif). The piece moves through clear because/therefore beats: Lyra inserts key → automaton reverses → she grasps the inverted sealing pattern → traces runes → loops close. Closure is a Decisive Change (she seals gaps) with a shift in role (guardian). However, the conceptual cost—"learning not what runes could do"—is mostly asserted in reflection rather than tested on the page, and the ending cost feels more thematic than felt. Orientation anchors are strong (floating isle, observatory, automaton).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Thomas, secret garden, three years post-substitution) land cleanly by ~100 words. The accumulative/textural lens holds: jasmine blooms, broken nest repair, and the tooth exchange accumulate density toward the final humming image that reweights forgiveness as innovation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—Thomas's choice to return the tooth and continue his healing work forecloses the path of bitterness with felt cost (accepting Elara's departure, embracing transformation over restoration). The cost is visible in "can't…but I'll visit" and his solitary preparation of tomorrow's tools. One persistent constraint (Elara's inability to stay) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Marina, grotto, dawn, three months post-lighthouse failure. The lens reads Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Marina's polishing unlocks the sea glass → grotto amplifies light → beacon guides boats → she teaches the village. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass begins to glow and she positions herself at the grotto's mouth, narrowing options from solitary search to communal solution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts that guidance can emerge from patience rather than the old lighthouse's power. Cost is conceptual and felt—she relinquishes the singular keeper role and distributes fragments—but the final paragraph's thematic summary ("pearl of stillness…tender persistence") tells more than it charges, slightly dulling the image's independent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (converting witnesses into gardeners) with thematic cost legible in the shift from viral visibility to "quiet revolution." Causality holds: viral confession → Marcus arrives → Kira offers cutting → teaching begins. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (moss garden as accreted meaning, viral story as texture), and the final image reweights the opening sanctuary frame. One structural slip: the three-year backstory and the viral-yesterday frame compete for primacy in the opening third, creating minor orientation friction before the present scene stabilizes around Marcus's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates images (mist, shell, cameo figures) and the ending reweights Marina's stance through the ritual release. Closure form: Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—she renounces collection-mode and accepts ephemeral witness-mode. Cost is legible: she leaves the shell and abandons the manuscript's closure quest. Minor penalty: the "solemnize this unfinishing" ceremony feels declared rather than pressured, softening the turn's inevitability. Orientation is clean (novelist at abandoned junction, morning mist, first paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph and builds through ritual song, vine bloom, and communal gathering. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—the tendril blooms, the villagers learn songs, and everything aligns without sacrifice, refusal, or a felt price. The escalation reads as smooth accumulation rather than a deepening that narrows options or reweights the stake with undeniable pressure. The ending reconfigures connection but does so through convenient convergence rather than a choice or renunciation that makes a before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (alchemist, crater, three months in) arrive cleanly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (apple cores, starlight vials, illustration plate) and the final sealing reconfigures the pattern into a permanent map, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure lacks a legible felt cost—the alchemist simply "began her long walk home" without forfeiting a prior option or paying a visible price, weakening the RR's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observations across multiple cave visits, building density through layered reflections and pre-echoes until the final realization that "damage sometimes revealed deeper mechanisms than perfection ever could." Closure is Conceptual Repricing—Mara's decision to preserve the blueprint of malfunction rather than repair reweights her entire profession with clear conceptual cost (rejecting her role as fixer). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The wounded season provides a coherent temporal frame, and causality holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara weaves progressively larger fractals, layering meanings until the whalebone structure completes. However, no on-page reversal or tightening changes her options or knowledge in a way that creates before/after legibility. The closure image—fractal completing, father's loop visible, burner cooling—offers atmospheric resonance but lacks felt cost; nothing is foreclosed, no path chosen over another. The ending reads as a meditative return to the same state rather than a reconfiguration with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Margaret, loft studio, rain, workbench) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through interwoven time scales (kettle countdown, three years since death, carving process) that converge in the final image. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the roughed-out clock face "that would never tell time, only hold it" crystallizes the stake (how to contain love after loss) with felt cost (she will teach workshops, sharing what she's learned, transforming private grief into public practice). One meaningful deepening occurs as the kettle's countdown intersects with her understanding that "presence persists in the spaces it once filled."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with elements (carousel, camera wheel, ghost, voices) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kira's acceptance of her role as memory keeper rather than architect. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure moment (ghost dissolving, waters moving again) registers as Charged Poise with conceptual cost legible in the line "some ambitions transform rather than die," though the emotional price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kira realizes she experiences "all the whens simultaneously," reweighting the chronological confusion motif.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (carnival debris, Maya's notebook, spaceport terminal). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the terminal as "machine for hope"—but the cost remains abstract; Maya sits satisfied, having solved the puzzle with no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The carnival frame and sextant discovery provide setup, but the middle consists of unobstructed valve-turning without a meaningful reversal or deepening that narrows options. The final image reweights the premise thematically but lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through sensory layering and recurring images (crystal, silence, petrichor), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara crystallizes her dual commitment. The cost is felt—she will "bear both worlds"—though the decision itself faces no on-page obstacle or reversal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the letter's invitation reweights her archived memories and relationship to silence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the sundial discovery, van der Meer's confession, and Mara's mirrored realization accumulate toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is clear early (barge, twilight, Amsterdam). However, the closure unit—Mara recognizing her own evasion—arrives primarily through summary reflection ("She'd run from that knowledge") rather than a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with visible cost. The decision to return home is stated as future intent, not enacted on the page, so the cost remains conceptual and displaced. The lens holds, but the ending lacks a charged final image that makes the repricing undeniable in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates through density of knowledge-preservation detail rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara resolves to continue the tradition, carrying the rope and fulgurite forward. However, cost remains conceptual and distant—"by morning she would need to teach"—rather than felt on the page. The decision to visit the granddaughter was already made; no present tightening forecloses a path or imposes visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by line 30; dominant stake (mapping grief to enable healing) signals early. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of image and reflection deepens toward the final metaphor of "healing as map." The closure image—winding the thread, promising to weave endings into peace—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), yet the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The reflection-heavy design (~40% reflective mass) is anchored to present stimuli (thread, garden, Marcus's projection) and interleaved with micro-choices (observing, writing in air, planning tomorrow's visit), meeting the BRR exception test.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (suspended palace, egg, Aldric's vigil) but the closure unit lacks legible cost. Aldric succeeds *and* fails, but the text tells us this is "bittersweet" rather than showing what path he has foreclosed or what price he pays for the flawed hatching. The final paragraph asserts that the world "began...to remember" but provides no on-page evidence of this shift—it's a conceptual claim without dramatized pressure. Under a Causal lens the because/therefore chain dissolves into summary once the egg hatches.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered imagery (sand, coin, thread, kelp) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise that crystallizes Maya's stance between destruction and preservation. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (Maya, lagoon, autumn). The grafting ritual provides on-page action with felt cost: she binds her inheritance into a talisman that forecloses denial as a path, accepting the weight "like an answer to a question she had finally learned how to ask." One meaningful deepening occurs when memory of the first warehouse fire reweights her understanding of inheritance mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is vague past 120 words: who the woman is, why she sits at this fountain, and what Marcus's arrival changes remain unclear until late exposition. The closure unit—fountains flowing again—occurs on the page, but causal linkage is weak: the feather "touches" time and memories "unstick" without dramatized resistance or cost. The geese resuming flight is coincidental to Marcus's ritual, not a consequence of his choice. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the final image delivers satisfaction without felt trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.9)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece cycles through vignettes (dying star, protostar nursery) with no because/therefore linkage narrowing options. Orientation anchors (who, translucent form; where, nebula garden; when, seven billion years tenure) arrive early. The closure attempt—"she had made peace with it"—lacks on-page cost; the final paragraph recapitulates prior exposition without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights the opening. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat registers a felt or conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed memorial transforms individual losses into collective strength, and the grandfather's departure marks a threshold crossed. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—density builds through layered images (monarchs, ribbon, names, poems) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when families touch the stone and Martha feels her grandfather's presence spreading. Cost is felt (grandfather's voice fades) but could be more undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes clear anchors (obsidian ridge, clock tower, Theodore's routine) and builds to a closure moment where Theodore speaks the inscriptions and the clock achieves "new tone." However, the escalation relies on mystical mechanics ("time itself seemed to hold its breath") rather than earned causality, and the cost remains abstract—the village "understanding without words" substitutes for on-page consequence. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the price paid is more asserted than dramatized, weakening the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates meaning through the tapestry's decoded threads, building toward a final image that reweights Marta's nightly work as part of a lineage of grief-tending. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (cemetery, silo, night work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Marta understands her work as continuous with the tapestry's creator, and the decision to plant the fragment tomorrow charges the present moment with intention. Cost is conceptual—she becomes curator of a tradition rather than solitary gardener—but the final image ("humming to the dead who appreciated most deeply the shape of her intentions") makes the reweighting legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the threads and sees her work mirrored. No causality breaks, though the chess clock setup doesn't constrain later choices as promised.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (Obsidian Spire, frozen lake, Mira). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "making change inevitable," but the transformation occurs off-page in the Council's minds; Mira herself faces no stakes-altering choice or cost in the final beat. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the ending mechanics—maps "unconsciously guide discussions"—lack dramatized causality linking Mira's night work to the Council's pivot. The cost (her ongoing labor, beginning another map) is continuity, not foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with thematic density building toward the final image of story restoration. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mariel carrying "luminous burden toward the awakening city" reweights the premise of story-famine recovery, though the conceptual cost (risk, isolation, slow cultural work) is implied rather than sharply legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pirate broadcast addresses Mariel directly, narrowing her mission's stakes, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment with a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, what), and the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: details about the gallery, mask, ash, and Thomas layer toward a conceptual repricing of "safety." The closure image—Marlene scattering the portrait as officers arrive—reconfigures the gallery's promise from literal refuge to ephemeral illusion with felt cost (Thomas dead, evidence destroyed). However, the cost is partly told ("natural causes," the examiner's future report) rather than dramatized in Marlene's present choice, and the mask's "sharp edges press against her skin" reads more symbolic than consequential. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the closure leans on retrospective summary ("she'd been the first") instead of immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure operates under a Causal lens with Charged Poise: Marcus's decision to "descend deeper" with the woman reconfigures his three-year solitary stance, foreclosing isolation with visible emotional cost ("feeling its weight"). The cog functions as both evidence and symbolic hinge, introduced early and returned with reweighted meaning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman opens her case and reveals shared knowledge, narrowing Marcus's options from refusal to collaboration. The cost is felt but conceptual—acceptance of methodical, patient truth-preservation over immediate confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the gathering of students and instruments builds density toward a pattern-break realization that the art continues through them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Chen accepts retirement and storage but recognizes continuation, forecloses institutional hope, and the final image of dispersing students "humming five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized" reweights the opening premise with felt cost. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The cost—retirement, program dissolution, zither into storage—is stated and felt, though the actual search for the missing modes is compressed into summary ("By evening, they had found all five modes") rather than on-page friction, which slightly softens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when early and attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens: the seed's transformation accumulates sensory detail and memory fragments toward a final image of the neural garden. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira simply succeeds, the greenhouse transforms, and the revolution is declared inevitable without on-page friction or trade-off. The triple-moonlight mechanism compresses months into minutes, but this convenience short-circuits dramatized pressure. The ending asserts future impact rather than landing a felt consequence now.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tower shifts from lightning collector to hope beacon, and Mira's involuntary confession transforms her isolation into community witness. The cost is legible—three years of theft exposed, her solitude ended. Drive lens reads as Causal with light Situational coloring; the broadcast decision follows motivated escalation from the neural dampener failure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One tightening (broadcast decision) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered observation and pattern recognition. Orientation anchors (Marina, bay, spring evening, streetlights) land cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the bay "cradling its displaced treasures like prayers" reweights the entire pattern of migrations with conceptual cost (grief sanctified through slow loss). The causal chain from displaced objects → bay → houses learning to hold absence is legible, though the mechanics of how objects migrate remains somewhat elided. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina sees through the orris root and understands the offerings.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly within the opening (coral-crusted statue, drowned garden, three centuries, diving bell). The causal lens holds: Thessaly's memory-threading drives Marina's realization, which produces the decision to tell the truth, freeing Thessaly from judgment's weight—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (Thessaly's secret burden lifted, Marina's academic narrative shattered). One meaningful tightening occurs when the poison's purpose is revealed, narrowing Marina's interpretive options. The cost is visible in Marina's trembling hands and the line about her reputation built on a lie, though the professional consequences remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers the staircase loop, the chipped die's growing imperfection, and the Sarah memory into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) at closure—Marcus climbs "with patient urgency," the rupture promised but not yet paid. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. Cost is felt through the seventeen-billion-step calculation and the acknowledgment that Sarah died while he climbed. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the staircase is a loop, not infinite, reweighting all prior momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered memory and kindness early, then deepens through painting and online response to rooftop gathering. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the greenhouse becomes a shared space; "some languages are never truly lost") with felt social cost implicit in the transformation from solitary artist to facilitator. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, smog, Mira) arrive cleanly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the online post sparks community formation, reweighting isolation into connection.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational/accumulative lens: thaw accelerates deterioration, Marta races to document before walls weep. Orientation is anchored early (grotto city, Marta as guide, post-thaw). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "loss into legacy," but the final image is stated rather than shown—"transforming loss into legacy" is asserted in the last line without a concrete on-page action or image that makes the cost unmistakable. The rosewater scent and waterfall's pitch change accumulate pressure, yet the ending resolves through narration ("the fierce tenderness... every rescued detail is a small victory") rather than a decisive physical act or charged image that reweights prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal lens holds: Elara's grandmother's journals → yoyo mechanism → lighthouse reversal forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (stone inverts from consuming to generating light) with conceptual cost visible in "illuminating not what was ahead but what had been lost in darkness behind." The orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two), and the single meaningful tightening occurs when the stone inverts. One persistent constraint—the stone's hunger—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The closure—Mara tricking Fear into self-revelation and containing it in the clasp—constitutes a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (Fear becomes "manageable, almost beautiful"), but the mechanics of the trick rely heavily on the paradox reversal occurring off-stage in summary ("spoke the paradoxical notes in reverse order") rather than dramatized pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirrors project her death and she recognizes Fear's loneliness, but the final containment feels convenient: Cornelius's role as guide-victim is revealed late without prior friction, and the clasp's warming signals resolution rather than a trade-off Mara enacts through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—escape from the recursive current—is clear, and the piece follows a causal chain: Kessa discovers the harmonic property, strikes the wood systematically, disrupts the spiral, and the orchard is freed. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the orchard simply moves on to the next challenge with no path foreclosed, no renunciation, no felt price. The ending gesture ("She smiled, knowing...") reads as a thematic summary rather than a reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with cost. The drive lens is Causal, but the resolution arrives through Kessa's competence without meaningful loss or constraint that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: reed whistle silence → Mira investigates → discovers crack-message → decides to follow. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening. The closure is a Charged Poise: Mira slips through the hatch as the turtle groans, crystallizing her commitment with the spreading cracks spelling messages and the city about to transform—options are reconfigured and cost is felt in the irreversible crossing. One deduction: the expedition's fate and the crack-message discovery happen off-page or via telescope, weakening the causal chain slightly; Mira reacts to information rather than experiencing reversals directly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure—Marcus walking away and leaving his insignia—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) but the cost remains gestural rather than felt; we see no consequence or foreclosed path on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens is asserted: Elara has already transmitted copies, so the confrontation's stakes deflate—Marcus's choice cannot stop her, reducing the scene to a persuasion exercise rather than a tightening dilemma. The "noble lies" thesis is extensively explained rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (shore surveyor, pavilion island, post-drawbridge). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered description and ritual acts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Edmund completes his archival gesture and departs, forecloses rescue-fantasy, accepts the pavilion's fate with visible cost (leaving only ripples, carrying "weight of witnessed absence"). The closure lands on the page with felt cost and coherent lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when he moves from documentation to personal ritual (grandmother's story), reweighting the stakes from professional to elegiac.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: blackout enables detection, detection reveals pattern, pattern motivates marking, restored power ends window. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~80 words. Closure achieves Earned Stasis—Mira completes her task knowing the truth survives for future indexers, accepting the cyclical nature of her work with visible cost (she must wait for the next blackout). The "already planning her next descent" line clarifies the foreclosed immediacy and ongoing commitment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algae intensifies and generators cycle, narrowing her working time.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors (workshop, tea garden, three months post-loss) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mei's grief transforms from paralyzing loss into generative memorial practice, with the final lantern-making representing Earned Stasis—she accepts Lin's absence while preserving love's luminous form. The accumulative lens (grief work → crystallization → integration → public offering) holds consistently through closure. However, the escalation is largely internal and processual; no external pressure tests Mei's commitment, and the discovery of "possibility" in the gem feels convenient rather than causally earned from prior polishing technique. The closure lands with thematic resonance but minimal visible cost—we don't see what Mei sacrifices or what competing path she forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Amira plans, accesses the scanner during the cooling window, discovers the pooled potential, and transmits the data before security arrives. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (data scattered, awakening begun), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt—no on-page consequence or trade-off materializes in the final beat, only a smile and declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens reads as accumulative/textural: the piece gathers matrices to complete a pattern, with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors early (observatory, Kira, drone, twilight). However, the closure cost is asserted rather than felt—"filling the missing pieces she hadn't known were empty" tells transformation without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what prior stance was sacrificed. The pilgrim's arrival and the matrix recovery follow because/therefore linkage adequately, but the final image lacks undeniable pressure or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: watch hand arrival → shore visit → carved evidence → family complicity → career parallel → closure choice. The closure is a Decisive Change (ending the business, placing the watch hand) with visible cost (income, identity, complicity broken). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes his grandfather's crimes and his own inheritance of silence. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under a situational-accumulative hybrid lens: pressure accumulates through parallel griefs and moon-phase structuring toward a Charged Poise closure where Elara crystallizes her stance ("first the gesture of faith, then the healing") with visible cost—she defers her own grief resolution to enable the exchange. Causality is clean: grandmother's recycled mistake → Elara's moon-phase wisdom → tomorrow's choreographed redemption. The orientation anchors (parapet, mist, pre-exchange night) arrive swiftly. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thorne's apology lands and Elara accepts it conditionally, narrowing the path to forgiveness and making tomorrow's exchange the necessary next step.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pole counting and compass handling accumulate pressure until the teaching offer reconfigures Marcus's stance with conceptual cost (accepting brokenness as a new navigation method). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Marcus, coastal launch, morning). The closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting toward Charged Poise): Marcus accepts his broken state and finds utility in simplicity, with the cost legible in his acknowledgment that the astronomical compass will never guide ships again. One meaningful deepening occurs at pole nineteen when he laughs at the seal, signaling the shift from passive grief to active acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure builds through the underground reveal and the labyrinth of paths, culminating in Marcus stepping forward with intention. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes options (each bridge a choice) and reconfigures his stance from passive guilt-bearer to active empathy-seeker. Orientation anchors cleanly (cave, lake, old woman by ~15% mark). The cost is felt but oblique—he walks forward carrying "the strange, terrible gift"—and no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page, keeping this in mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens early and anchors who/where/when within the opening. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Mira perceives Kess through all living things and stands transformed—with felt cost (she has dissolved her human boundaries to reach connection). The spice-scent acts as the decisive catalyst, and the final image (moth transformation of the fortune) reweights the opening cookie prophecy. One persistent weakness: the transformation beat summarizes sensory overload rather than dramatizing a single impossible choice under that pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is established early (cartomancer, midnight glade, post-birth timeframe). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and reflection build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara mends the saucer and integrates her mother's presence into her daughter's future. The closure unit—sealing the crack with starlight, carrying the cards with "new prophecies," writing the birth announcement with invisible ink—reconfigures the stake (guilt and loss transformed into recovered time) with felt cost (the permanent shadow of absence now made generative). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother appears and the card spread becomes a pattern "for restoration." Cost is legible in the final image: the traced hand "holding all the accumulated time they had finally found" signals opportunity reclaimed but not undone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when) by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through meditation, discovery of the fracture, application of the Tear, and the stitching ritual that dissolves the dimensional barrier. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/conceptual repricing): the barrier "ceased to exist, having never been real" and Mei becomes "the first human complete." Cost is conceptual—humanity's split nature integrated—but the final image of "luminous acceptance" and the ship continuing its journey lacks the visceral weight or felt price that would elevate this into the 8+ range. The lens holds; the closure lands; the cost reads oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines; no penalty applies. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern build toward a final transformation—but the closure effect lacks visible cost: Elara's "metamorphosis" is asserted through elevated diction rather than a choice that forecloses options. The storm detour, volcano eruption, and dream operate as coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational-lens discipline. The ending reconfigures premise conceptually but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening lines. The piece establishes a pattern of coded resistance that deepens through the sundial mechanics and Amara's entrance, culminating in a charged poise: the revolution is lit, roles are set, and Thorne returns to his post carrying quiet certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when Amara confirms the blackout was intentional, reweighting Thorne's prior surveillance into active rebellion. Cost is legible—Amara risks her rank, Thorne his safety—but felt more as conceptual repricing than visceral forfeiture in the final image. The closure reconfigures prior watchfulness into nascent fire, satisfying RR/CR under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Keeper Yann, tidal bluff, aurora). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-laying deepens through stone placement, star dust scattering, and eel arrival, culminating in Yann beginning new patterns for her apprentice—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she accepts the covenant's continuation. The closure reweights her role from cursed herder to pattern-keeper with conceptual cost (decades of tending ahead). However, the cost remains asserted ("decades hence") rather than felt on the page through a specific forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Maya resets the timer, commits to the vigil with visible stakes ("revolution could be written in the grammar of storms"), and the final image of the turning dome reweights her entire resistance as patient and unstoppable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through recurring motifs (timer, envelope, storm, stars) and a cadence shift at the end crystallizes meaning. One constraint: the lens wobbles slightly in the middle third between causal (her discovery of the envelope drives new work) and accumulative (density of metaphor), but it coheres at closure. Cost is felt: she remains in exile, isolated, risking discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through the angle-tracing motif. However, the closure unit—Marlowe's promise that "questions, properly asked, could indeed become destinations"—restates the premise without reweighting it through on-page cost or changed options. The "revolution being planned" remains abstract; no concrete stake is tested or altered. The needle card/sundial/light-trace trinity creates a pattern, but the final image recapitulates rather than reconfigures, yielding thematic echo instead of Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by ~120 words (vagrant poet, rusted library, moonlight). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: details of the anthology, the resistance network, and Marcus's influence layer toward a thematic closure. However, the ending offers only tonal affirmation ("a vagrant penny poet, working by moonlight") without a decisive change, visible cost, or reconfigured stance—October was already committed at the start and remains so. The final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it, missing the requirement for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens holds, but closure lacks the necessary pressure or price.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is prompt (station pianist, aerial terminal, compass storms anchored by paragraph two). The closure—Sophia stepping through the screen—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: the clock lurches forward one minute, yet no prior scene establishes what Marion forfeited or risked to achieve this. The piece follows a causal lens (music → harmonics → corridor through storm → return), but the final beat short-circuits earned pressure; Marion's improvisation succeeds without friction, making the reversal feel convenient. The drive holds through the climax, but the lack of on-page struggle or trade-off at the moment of breakthrough caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds pressure through multiplying contradictions and reaches Conceptual Repricing when Mira reclassifies the island, reweighting the premise with a new taxonomy. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (challenging the Council, using an unprecedented classification), and the knowledge-fruit sequence causally enables the final judgment. One meaningful deepening occurs when contradictory memories force Mira to shift her interpretive frame. Minor slip: the "quantum folklore" label feels slightly imposed rather than inevitable, nudging the score below 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—lace, compass, juniper, shore—that reweight Kenji's stance from paralyzed grief to readiness to write. Closure is Charged Poise: "Tomorrow, he would write" crystallizes the decision with undeniable emotional cost (the year-long severance persists today). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when the compass needle stops spinning and points toward "the exact shade of cerulean," forcing Kenji's internal shift. Cost is legible in the phrase "forgive me, I was afraid" and the persistence of his silence through today.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through pattern recognition in butterfly dust and decay. Closure is a conceptual repricing where Elena's realization that "decay is instruction" reweights her understanding of science, with cost legible in her resignation and the greenhouse's transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Marina's decision to transform her art, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The ledger's revelation tightens options, and the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (realizing music's secret language) and cost is legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with persistent constraint (silence) shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from experiments to insight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost in Silas's departure note and new role; orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of insomnia shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through patterned acts of giving, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community becomes self-sustaining. Closure lands with cost in Marta's fatigue and the bell's echo, and the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure of shards (midnight runs, community responses) is taught early and coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands decisively with Mae's offering of photographs, reconfiguring her purpose under a causal lens. The cost is legible in her emptied state and the ghost's fade. Orientation is clear early, and events link logically from memory to action without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the fragment's dissolution and the fading photographs. The lens holds without contradiction, and the halo fragment's persistent constraint shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration as Marcus escapes and commits to seeding resilience, with cost legible in "the chains were gone, but his purpose had never been clearer." The causal drive lens holds tightly from arrow arrival to decoding and escape, with no orientation issues. Persistent constraints like the chains and vault shape tactics, and the ending lands with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The realization that trust breaking and birth are indistinguishable lands with felt cost, and persistent constraints like the sunken orchard shape tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of "broken wholeness."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the mother's weeping and Cassia's redefinition of her work—under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of fleeting light shapes tactics. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost, as the control room transforms into a space for inquiry and "fear began its slow transformation into curiosity." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with imagery and reflection building coherence. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks; the persistent constraint of the abandoned plant shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (Jake overwhelmed by transferred fears), under a causal lens that holds throughout; orientation is clear within 120 words, and the reversal sequence from the cast drives the climax organically. The persistent constraint of programmed fears shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under accumulative lens; cost of patience is legible in "she smiled, knowing she had time yet"; orientation and causality remain solid.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost in the final image of endless mopping cycles, under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The timeline loops are taught early and coalesce into a coherent revelation, with orientation anchored within 120 words. The persistent constraint of cyclical existence shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost as they reconcile and hold hands, under a Causal lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words: Mira as night registrar, Samuel under canopy, after closing. The lens holds without ambiguity; confessions drive the resolution. Cost is legible in "relief that flooded through her felt like spring rain" and the thawing mistrust.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Marta passes on her method, reconfiguring the theme of luck and deception with felt cost. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages in her actions affecting the garden. Orientation is clear early, and the ending image charges prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Ira's realization reweights the universe's rules, with cost legible in the station's shudder and Vasquez's alarm. The Hybrid lens (causal and accumulative) holds, and the magnetic nexus constrains tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands with cost in the darkness and the continued note, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the flooded space persistently constrains tactics, leading to a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Mira's solitude and hidden knowledge. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and thematic resonance. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of margins shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marcus leaves the valve wheel, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost under the accumulative/textural lens, which holds consistently. The plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from radio calls to discovery, with orientation anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: flood → ruined greenhouse → pattern observation → perspective shift → resignation → institutional recognition forms a coherent causal arc. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural, with the dust patterns and slow regrowth steadily reweighting Elena’s stance until a decisive change is inevitable. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing and soft Decisive Change: she abandons her old project, and the university reconfigures the greenhouse around her new paradigm, with career and institutional costs implied. Some late-stage developments (outside scientists, demolition postponement) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense canyon frame interwoven with backstory about the fire and the father’s uranium glass, culminating in a choice about the ledger and her future. Causal links are solid—arson leads to flight with the strip, reading it reframes her past, which reframes her artistic failures and informs her decision to let the world think she’s dead and to end the legacy. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/decisive change (she chooses a new identity and mission) with legible cost (abandoning her career and public self). If anything, the central on-page dilemma (destroy vs. use the ledger) is floated more as a conceptual fork than dramatized through concrete, escalating obstacles in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal-accumulative: present-tense research actions interwoven with backstory and reflection, leading to a revaluation of what music and listening mean. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and solid, and the through-line of experimentation with frequencies provides continuity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she realizes she hasn’t lost music, only changed its language. The main limitation is that the on-page turn is more of a deepening of an already ongoing process than a sharply escalated beat with new consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: mysterious lens → descent following distress coordinates → encounter with Sleepless Librarians → decision to transform the library → earned stasis when he stays. The drive reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural flavor, and closure lands cleanly with conceptual and emotional cost (abandoning the living world). Some transitions (“The descent took three days,” “The transformation took months, or perhaps minutes”) compress major beats into summary, softening the sense of concrete turning points, but they don’t break logic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sanctions → solitary giving → anonymous reciprocity → community-wide pattern → officials’ arrival → Marta’s handoff. Causality holds throughout; each phase grows logically from the last, and the bell’s recurring use gives the piece a strong spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Marta relinquishes nightly duty, and the community’s identity has visibly changed. Some key transitions (e.g., “Six months in…she no longer needed to make most of the runs”) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts structural sharpness at a prestigious-lit level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: past-life memory → pilgrimage to viaduct → spirit instruction → use of the tear → revelation of the door → decision to release the photographs. The story reads primarily under a causal-plus-accumulative lens and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mae’s understanding of the camera’s purpose and of unused love is reweighted with real consequence. Stakes and goal stay coherent throughout, and orientation (who/where/when) is established early and maintained. The one limitation is that potential failure or alternative outcomes are only lightly implied, so the path can feel a bit pre-ordained rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: discovery of the fragment → immersion in temporal images → walk through the hyperbolic maze → dissolution and reframing of what time is. Closure is a clean conceptual repricing: she moves from being “trapped by the past” to understanding herself as time’s gardener, with the cost of losing the photographs and alternate selves. Causality functions symbolically rather than mechanically but remains legible under an accumulative/lyric lens. There are no real plot surprises, yet the progression tightens meaningfully toward the center of the maze.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: clandestine captivity → arrow arrival → decoding keys → using the arrow to snap the weakened chain → harvesting seeds → departure on a concrete mission. Orientation is strong early (who, where, why) and the piece maintains a single coherent scene with clear progression. Closure is decisive and legible: Marcus transitions from captive guardian to active liberator with a new set of options and obligations. The main structural weakness is the lack of on-page friction at the escape/harvest stage, which makes the middle feel almost too unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens: present-time forging and testing are interleaved with backstory and reflection in a single continuous scene, moving steadily toward the moment she hears the frequency. Causality is clean—discover notebooks → activate forge → apply imprinting method → gain new auditory perception—and closure arrives as a conceptual repricing when she reframes betrayal/trust as one continuum. Cost is legible in how much of her life and identity have been organized around this quest, and how the realization rewrites her understanding of her grandfather’s experience. Structure is tight for the length, though the process unfolds smoothly rather than through a strongly marked mid-scene turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Cassia arrives with a clear goal, executes her method on the seventh portrait, reveals a truth, and exits with a reweighted stance, all in one continuous scene. Causality is straightforward (her coded flowers → clandestine meeting → use of moonbeams → emotional revelation), with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mother gains painful clarity, and Cassia recommits to her role, framed by the flower code promising that some moments *are* real. The main limitation is that everything proceeds without much resistance or complication, so the arc feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the control room with a steady accumulative build from solitary ritual to shared use of the spheres. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—each act of cleaning, heating, and placing glass reconfigures the space, culminating in the couple’s arrival and the invitation to write their question. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but it lands: the plant’s purpose has been conceptually repriced. Stakes and cost remain more thematic than situational, which keeps the arc from feeling fully urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—child with cast → equations/coordinates → rusted library confrontation → shell reversal—is clean and easy to follow. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in power and knowledge: Marcus keeps his autonomy, Jake collapses under the transferred fears. However, the speed and ease of Marcus decoding advanced protocols “on the drive” and flawlessly reprogramming the shell read convenient for the complexity implied. The piece could earn a higher score by dramatizing some risk or partial uncertainty in that process rather than presenting it as a fait accompli.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear present-time frame (this dawn, this star’s possible last pulses) and a closure beat in her realization that the star will linger. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent—watching, recording, reinterpreting—and the final conceptual repricing of “endless night” as process, not event, lands. Stakes and cost are quiet but present (a life given to waiting and mapping absence), and there are no causality or orientation slips. The main limitation is that the turn is almost entirely cognitive, with low on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: post-procedure setup → perception of the violin across timelines → contact and realization → return to mopping with a transformed understanding. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens: the temporal module enables multi-loop observation, which culminates in contact with the violin and the conceptual repricing of “maintenance” and consciousness. Closure lands: Seven gains the answer he sought and accepts a cyclical, eternal-return form of work as his stasis, with the cost being his endless repetition reframed. Stakes remain mostly philosophical rather than situationally pressing, which slightly flattens the urgency of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter framed by a shared past, with backstory woven in via specific objects and references rather than exposition dumps. Causality broadly holds—eavesdropping leads to knowledge, which informs the confrontation, and Marcus’s confession reconfigures the stakes. However, the decisive external turn (Marcus’s confession and treatment) happens entirely off-stage, so the climactic relief is more told than dramatically earned in the scene. Closure as a resonant reconfiguration is present and legible, but the cost and consequence feel slightly undercut by that off-page resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—Marta moving through the maze, interwoven with memories of past “mended deceptions,” then meeting the rejected applicant—reads clean and coherent. Closure lands when Marta passes on her method (and a marble) to the younger woman and feels her own “luck index” shifting, a small but legible before/after. The drive is more conceptual than dramatic, but the throughline of resisting quantified fortune holds. A slightly static middle (recounting inspector/drought as anecdotes rather than tests-in-progress) keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: twilight alignment → experiment escalation → resonance crisis → stabilized new equilibrium and realization. Causal links (lever → resonance → shudder → visions of past/future selves) are legible, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where time’s nature is re-understood. The main weakness is the near-absence of on-page cost at the end—station risk is raised but then defused quickly—so the before/after is more intellectual than felt. Still, the arc is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory, moving causally from discovery of the program, to deciphering, to performance and supernatural culmination. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine—each return to the pit and each bar revealed escalates toward the climactic note. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus and Elisabetta complete the piece together, and reality is subtly rewritten via the restored program, with a conceptual cost around what art and death can do. Stakes stay intimate and there’s no major plot surprise, but the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: fever breaks → discovery of illustration → reconstruction of hidden history → auroral event → decision to conceal and leave. Causality is coherent and low-key but firm, with no unkept setups or retroactive patches. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Mira redefines what counts as “recordable truth” and pays the price of omission and isolation. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently from first paragraph to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous descent framed by the radio’s evolving content, leading causally to discovery and a resonant return to the surface. The radio confessions escalate both knowledge and pressure in a coherent Accumulative/Causal blend, directly guiding Marcus toward the valve and reconfiguring his purpose. Closure is strong as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses to disturb the object and reframes his role from solver to witness. There are no real causality breaks; the only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the external stakes remain modest and the danger never quite tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from her tending the library, to explorers, to the mushroom-words, to the ultimate realization that she is the chronicle. The closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—history as ecosystem and self as document—with conceptual cost (self-erasure into function) legible. That said, progression is more even drift than articulated turn; beats echo rather than tighten. Within a lyric mode it works, but it doesn’t quite achieve the inevitability and pressure of top-tier pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a single eclipse scene braided with concise backstory—reads clean and coherent, with clear orientation and no causality breaks. The approach of totality provides a natural temporal spine, moving from setup (envelope and note) through ritual performance to the release of the curl. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the object is surrendered, the bond reconfigured, and Sofia takes up the “ordinary magic.” Cost (letting go of the talisman and role) is present but understated, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: discovery of tapestry → diaries → conceptual realization about the displaced axis → acceptance of her custodial role. Causality is coherent, and the closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing where she reframes the “bronze quiet” as charged pause rather than ending. The cost—perpetual solitary tending of echoes—is implicit but present. Escalation is largely intellectual and spiritual, which works, though a slightly sharper on-page price would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s structure is clean and legible: one late-night tavern scene, anchored flashbacks, and a forward drive toward the lighthouse. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—his long habit of writing futures leads to this night where he arranges slips, writes his own fortune, reads the lighthouse, and exits. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: his disappearance is the culmination of the same orchestration he’s used on others. A minor limitation is that some stakes (e.g., what concrete danger his prophecy poses) remain abstract, but this doesn’t break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece holds as a single continuous exorcism scene with clear spatial anchors and a consistent accumulative/textural drive. Causality is coherent: Marcus’s use of the loop pedal and rhetorical examination steadily strips the demon of power, leading to the woman’s release and the reweighted final silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: stillness and possession are re-understood, with the woman regaining agency. The main structural limitation is that the “seventeen minutes” clock never meaningfully constrains tactics or choices, so temporal stakes feel underused.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a tight, accumulative single scene: present-moment conducting framed and deepened by well-anchored memories. The causal chain is more emotional than event-driven but coherent: fortunes → nautilus mapping → realization → dawn symphony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Mei becomes “chronologically home,” reweighting all prior dislocation. The cost—her long-standing disorientation and the looming exhaustion clock—is present but somewhat soft on the page, keeping it short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is coherent: the tablet and viaduct rules set up the predicament, pressure accumulates as the bridge reconfigures and Kira fragments, and closure arrives when she consciously triggers collapse/unification. The causal chain (touch relic → fractured timelines → viaduct as procedural maze → pressing the rune to collapse branches) holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is on-page and legible with cost—other Kiras “fade”/merge and the bridge itself becomes unnecessary—but the decisive solution (pressing the rune) arrives without much prior tactical testing or genuine doubt, softening the sense of earned jeopardy. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the outset, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: she enters the cavern, prepares the phonograph, undergoes the backward-music experience, and exits reconfigured; no beats feel extraneous. Causality is simple but coherent (months of experimentation → decision to test in this legendary cavern → bone-conducted experience → thaw and conceptual shift), with no orientation problems. Closure lands via a clear before/after: she reinterprets her deafness and relationship to music, with cost preserved (her hearing is not restored). Pressure is more accumulative/lyric than plot-reversalist, but that’s appropriate to the piece’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean and causal: pigeon arrival → revelation via messages → recontextualization of her past work → decision to act with new tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she re-commits to the same work under a newly dangerous and politically charged frame. The causal chain is plausible and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. A higher score would require one more concrete on-page complication or choice that forces her into a narrower, costlier path rather than an almost frictionless recommitment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: single setting, one continuous emotional sequence, and a clear causal chain from discovering the vial to undergoing transformation. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural—the scents and visions layer until the closure beat redefines her identity and trade. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she becomes the perfume/greenhouse/archive, with a visible cost of bearing all that loss. A touch more on-page resistance or a concrete alternative path (refusing the catalyst) would push the causal stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each new temporal “layer” causally follows Marcus’s requests and deepens his understanding, culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration about time and moral consequence. The orientation is solid from the outset (who/where/when) and the pattern of revelation is easy to follow. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus leaves changed, having accepted a new role in the universe’s moral economy, with the rope and grotto now reframed as a teaching engine. The main limitation is that the on-page cost feels largely intellectual rather than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: Mara enters the greenhouse, tests the space, music accumulates, community coalesces, and the conceptual frame of “unfinished perfection” is repriced at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the arrival of each musician and the growing ensemble form a coherent escalation toward a resonant reconfiguration: the hush becomes a generative quiet. Closure lands clearly with the community’s transformed use of music and story, though the cost of the old world is felt more in description than in on-page choice. The structure is elegant and legible, if a bit low on surprise in its final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene from dusk through the grotto’s brief permeability window to its sealing and her exit. Causality is straightforward (grotto transforms → harvesting intensifies → time runs out → temptation arises → she recommits to her rule and leaves). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final stance that curated half-emotions are “merciful lies” reweights everything that came before. The cost and stakes of breaking her rule are only implied, not dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: concert → routine library visit → mistaken envelope → decision to intervene → voyage to Whitmore → reunion → shared work at the library → student’s thank-you photo reframing Margot’s life. The structure holds to a clear drive lens (Causal with a light accumulative texture) and lands in a Conceptual Repricing of what “cargo” and “accounts” mean for her. The main beats are well-sequenced with no glaring teleports or unkept setups, and the closure unit is legible and satisfying. The only limitation is that several major turns (Torres’ agreement, Martha’s rapid engagement with the library) are handled at summary speed, shaving some felt cost off the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Kira’s work → village trust → attention to the tag → mapping → pattern → descent → discovery and reintegration of the first artist. The accumulative ritual of the search reads as purposeful rather than episodic, and the final reconfiguration of the community (no one “outside the web”) lands as closure. However, obstacles are minimal and resolution comes smoothly once the pattern is seen; the exiled artist’s return involves little resistance or complication. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with textural buildup), held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: the pendant hums, she tracks the disturbance via the canals to Morteus, discovers the chamber of stolen moments, acts to release them, and the city’s temporal system reconfigures with visible consequence. Closure is strong via a conceptual repricing of “borrowing time” and a concrete after-image (cracked pendant, clear canals, waking giant). Structure is essentially one continuous drive with a brief, efficient backstory insert, and the cost of her choice is legible even if not deeply dwelt on. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and the before/after of the city’s cadence reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single night’s descent into the orchard, setup of the mosaic and eyes, activation, revelation, and a reflective exit, all under a stable accumulative/textural drive. Causality is coherent—her prior research on the chips leads to correctly placing the eyes, which triggers the vision of Elias and the conceptual shift around loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines absence/presence and chooses to leave the eyes, planning to return as a student rather than a seeker of return. Stakes stay conceptual, but the before/after in her understanding is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: power outage → archivist’s problem → Edgar’s intervention → revelation of her parallel project → invitation and Edgar’s decision for tomorrow. Structure is tight for a single-scene piece, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of what “visibility” means for him. The cost—risking his anonymity—is present but understated, so the decisive change reads more contemplative than pressurized. There are no orientation or lens issues; the Causal drive holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in place and time, with the storms and leaf transformation causally leading to Marcus’s decision to accept metamorphosis. The closure is a genuine on-page shift—he moves from observer to participant, crossing into “something necessarily in between”—with a sense of inherited duty. Causality is intact and legible, though the progression feels more inevitable than pressured, with few real alternative paths explored. Still, the final walk “deeper into the green darkness” lands as a decisive, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: tidal window → journey across causeway → exchange → return, with clear causal links and a strong final reconfiguration as Mara’s purpose shifts from survival commissions to a more truthful, commemorative art. The tidal clock and vanishing rain trails provide a built-in temporal frame that feels coherent and never confusing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she exits with new stakes (how she’ll spend the finite water) and a charged sense of cost (family heirloom traded, mother’s burial). The only minor limitation is that present-tense tactical pressure around missing the tide stays largely atmospheric rather than sharply altering choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: pilgrim → pearl → lost visions → cave → encounter → altered gift, with no glaring logic gaps. Structure is simple but effective: one main scene with a brief backstory shard, culminating in an on-page conceptual reconfiguration of Vera’s powers and worldview. Closure is solid—her gift “returns, transformed,” and the final moment with the pilgrim and the glowing palm clearly marks a new status quo with a cost (loss of former certainty). Escalation is modest and largely internal, but the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival → resumption of work → evolving archival method → communal engagement → final valve act. Causality is soft but coherent, and the pattern of fragments and intervals builds toward a Conceptual Repricing closure in the last paragraph, where presence/absence are reweighted. Cost (the exile’s years, the work of compilation) is legible, if primarily conceptual and communal rather than acutely personal on the page. Orientation is excellent from the first lines; the lens holds consistently through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrows → decision to follow → progressive weirding → arrival at fortress → exit with altered stance, all legible under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality inside the surreal frame holds, and the Terminal Lines punch pays off nicely as a key mechanic at the mist wall. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her life’s work as mapping unspoken truths with intent to return. The main limitation is that the journey unfolds smoothly without much structural complication or surprise beyond the central reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece uses a clean, accumulative structure over the three-day migration, with beats that progress from coincidence to investigation to conceptual acceptance. Causality is coherent: discovery of the tile → correlation with whale songs → sustained transcription and reflection → final reconfiguration of her worldview. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she reframes skepticism and legacy—at a clear before/after line (“Her skepticism hadn’t been wrong, merely incomplete”). The cost is subtle but legible: she relinquishes the security of a purely empirical stance and accepts a more ambiguous, entangled mode of inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: solar storm → amulet’s reaction → Vex opening the window → crew’s arrival → amulet reassembly → door and step-through. The piece maintains a single scene with clear spatial logic and no orientation issues, and the backstory (Consortium exile, prior shattering of the amulet) directly informs present stakes. Closure is solidly a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: Vex and the crew choose the unknown beyond immortality, foreclosing the prior “endless watching” state. The only limitation is that the Consortium and wider stakes remain largely offstage, so the mutiny’s external consequences stay conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Wei breaches because of the theft, confronts Maya, and her prepared offer of restitution and ashes reconfigures the situation. The scene is continuous, well-oriented, and the envelope plus ink-pot request culminate in an Earned Stasis closure where Maya chooses to bury what remains of her father. Costs are legible (relinquishing inheritance, accepting knowledge of her father’s crimes), though escalation is more intellectual than perilous and Wei’s de-escalation feels somewhat swift. Still, the before/after is clear and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous night-to-dawn scene that steadily accumulates textual and conceptual density as she prepares, listens, charts, and then closes the notebook. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the shift at dawn and closing the lamp/notepad function as a gentle closure unit—Earned Stasis/Charged Poise more than decisive change. Causality is coherent and orientation is excellent, but the final beat doesn’t fully crystallize a before/after with sharp cost so much as reaffirm ongoing practice. The result is satisfying but not quite structurally electric.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—daily walks, discovery of Container 47-B, recognition of a pattern, and spring-tide revelation—builds coherently to a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot twist. Causality is clean: overheard dock talk → investigation of the container → recognition of other “administrative ghosts” → joining the congregation. Closure is clear and on-page: signing the names and leaving with the label as “compass” reframes her existence under a new communal logic with conceptual cost. The structure remains mostly linear and legible, though the pressure of each step could be tightened by foregrounding what she risks losing if she doesn’t find belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The single-scene structure is clean: climb → experiment with shell → cello’s response → Claudia’s explanation → joint experiment → Marina’s decision. Causality holds throughout, and the closure—Marina agreeing to help finish the cello/compass—is a clear resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Some backstory is delivered via Claudia’s exposition, but it’s anchored in present action and doesn’t break momentum. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the ending reweights all prior beats coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: coded warning → developers arrive → Maya convenes the community → they choose a legal-strategic reorganization that reconfigures their status. Orientation is strong from the opening and the structure holds a single, coherent drive to preserve the raft city. However, several pivotal moves—legal maneuvering, community resistance, developer reaction—are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of risk and cost at the climax. Closure is solid (a Decisive Change with a resonant new stasis), but it feels slightly too easy given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the fissure → long-term documentation → final emergence aligned with evacuation, culminating in a last vigil and departure. The time pressure (six-hour reaction, 14-hour sunrise/rocket window) provides a quiet but coherent structural clock. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Vera reframes her act as witnessing humanity’s retreat, marked by leaving the hourglass behind. The piece leans accumulative rather than twist-driven, but the before/after (ongoing vigil vs. completed farewell) is legible and costs her the place she cares about.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged drone → diagnostic via mist → repair → launch → ship departs guided. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when are established quickly, and the scene holds a single coherent drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change—Maya’s role and the depot’s meaning crystallize through the successful departure. The main weakness is that the announced high stakes never encounter a meaningful on-page complication or near-failure, so the climax feels somewhat low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: failed reconnaissance → condensation insight → reinterpretation of the lake → arrival of the inspector → decision to share the discovery. The piece lands a clear Charged Poise closure: Margot shifts from guarded secrecy to collaborative risk, reconfiguring the stakes. Costs and implications (defying or reshaping Commonwealth aims) are present but mostly implied, not dramatized in concrete consequences. Structure is tight and well-contained within one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tuner arrives → listens and tests → teaches deliberate walking → town’s structures heal → she departs, leaving a self-sustaining ritual. Causality is coherent under the story’s magical rules, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the town shifts from dependency on her to an earned stasis of collective practice. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized: the implied ongoing discipline needed to avoid slipping back into forgetfulness. The “before/after” line around the collapse and the archway scenes is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: lost expedition, dwindling breathing compound, discovery of the sanctum, then the machine, culminating in her decision to join it. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the temple’s paradoxical geometry is consistent and later reframed as something she can deliberately navigate. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost—she consciously abandons any chance of physical survival and her daughter to become part of the temple’s eternal moment. The only minor limitation is that the “machine for capturing moments” revelation is a touch expository rather than dramatized through a concrete interaction or test.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of journals → realization of the real killer → need to act before the boat comes → choice to escape the cell and use the lattice. Backstory (the father, the wolves, the warden) is integrated via the journals and the lattice visions, so it directly tilts the present rather than pausing it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the prison designed for liars becomes a vessel of truth, with a clear before/after in Marcus’s status and the narrative of the crime. The cost (a lifetime of unjust imprisonment, inherited curse, and the weight of dead children) is legible even though external consequences are projected rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clean: the bead warms → her early arrival and warning → the centennial “resonant awakenings” → she cracks the bead → curse breaks and night lifts. This yields a decisive change with clear before/after and cost (loss of magic, loss of her). Backstory is efficiently woven through a single reflective block anchoring present stakes. The only limitation is Marlow’s relative passivity in the climax, which makes the resolution feel more like a fated ritual than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present action (dawn sewing) interwoven with concise backstory, discovery of the pattern, and the plate’s activation, culminating in a reweighted world-state. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the children move to the walls and the labyrinth becomes a bridge between ruin and reverence, with Calla’s ongoing task framed as costly, hopeful labor. The causality is more mythic than logistical but consistent with the piece’s rules; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues. Stakes and costs are a bit abstract and gentle, which slightly tempers impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in Miriam’s return, discovery of the sundial base, the reveal of the gnomon, and the completion of the sundial as a closure beat. Causality is coherent—dreams → return → guided wandering → tomb/sundial → realization and commitment—and the “time inscribed as names” plus the final inscription produce a resonant reconfiguration of her relation to time and home. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than situational, but it’s legible: she abandons a stance of perpetual departure. No major set-ups are dropped, and the pattern of return and circular time is paid off at the sundial’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: we move through one continuous ritual from chalking to locking the gate, with details steadily reweighting the meaning of Mira’s vocation. Causality is clean and orientation is excellent; the “three more hours” structure and rain’s erasure give a loose temporal spine. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Mira returning tomorrow and the mail trucks as “seeds of an older, newer world” conceptually reprices the whole ritual. Still, escalation is modest and the cost is largely implied rather than sharply crystallized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: long-term eavesdropping → encoding intelligence into charts → tonight’s “final piece” before the coup begins tomorrow, with Crane’s visit tightening the window. The story tracks a single scene with integrated backstory and maintains orientation cleanly under a causal lens. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than a decisive external change—Vera finishes encoding and dispatching the last chart, the coup is imminent, and the revolution’s chances are fundamentally altered by her work. The main limitation is that much of the revolution’s impact is off-stage; stakes rely on implication rather than a concrete on-page turn, but they remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual journey framed by succinct backstory, with clear causal steps from entering the labyrinth to using the shard to send the message. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration and decisive change—she chooses to speak rather than remain cryptic—and the cost (years of silence, risk of vulnerability) is legible on the page. The gargoyle shard, condensation-windows, and spirits’ song all pay off coherently at the end. The main limitation is that obstacles within the ritual are minimal; the path feels more like an inevitable progression than a pressured problem-solving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the atrium with backstory interleaved via clear sensory cues (the cast, the coral, the girl). Causality is modest but solid: the girl’s approach → translation ritual → communal participation → Maya’s reconfiguration of her survival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after in Maya’s self-understanding is legible and paid for. The drive lens reads consistently as accumulative/textural with situational pressure, and there are no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal arc is clean and legible: fragment → activation of the knowledge network → light-painting and communal reconstruction → resolved intention to continue. The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, building pressure through intensifying images of past joy rather than overt plot turns. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Marina reframes her role from private dreamer to public restorer, accepting the ephemerality of the visions. Stakes remain modest and mostly conceptual, but they cohere and resolve without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure with a coherent causal chain: restoration → discovery of the coin → temporal/acoustic distortion → realization of recurrence → alternate choice. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she forecloses immediate understanding by re-hiding the coin, with the cost of remaining in uncertainty. The drive lens feels Hybrid (causal plus textural), but it stays consistent and the before/after is legible without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is tight: the Cognition Tax premise, covert garden network, and insect noise are all set up before the Auditors’ arrival, and their knock turns the scene cleanly into the climax. Causality holds—Marcus’s expertise explains each defensive move, and Serena’s exit through the maintenance tunnel is a direct, motivated response. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Marcus stays as decoy while their message continues, with the risk of capture clearly implied. The only thing keeping this just below elite is that the warping operation itself stays mostly conceptual rather than structurally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the shell, postcard, lullabies, and arriving artists build a clear pattern toward a conceptual closure where worn things become illumination. Causality is soft but legible under this lens—her lullabies attract others, which turns the shell into a greenhouse and makes the armistice self-sustaining. The core before/after (flowers as weapons → photosynthesis of pain) is clearly reconfigured by the end with a felt conceptual cost. Still, much of the “plot” is reported history rather than on-page turning points, so structural tension remains relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: strange resonance → recognition of the song → race to capture it before the chime fails → recontextualizing her work at the Wall of Lost Names. Causality is intact and legible; lighting the lamp widening the crack is a nice concrete because/therefore link. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she secures Solmieth and reframes the library not as mausoleum but as bridge against oblivion. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through a difficult trade, keeping it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: years of deadlock → Elena’s discovery → reinterpretation of key promises → completion of a new “score” → departure for the summit. The piece lands a solid Charged Poise closure, with her walking toward a decisive moment that will test everything she’s done. Cost is mostly conceptual (the risk of worsening the divide, the years of failure before her), but legible enough to make a before/after meaningful. Escalation is modest, yet structurally the story is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: longstanding conflict → adhesive clue → amphitheater visit → new floodgate design → decision to present it as “purely technical,” culminating in a charged final image. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she locks in a plan that will force collaboration and misperception, accepting personal invisibility as price. Structure is cleanly single-scene-with-reflection; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues. The main limitation is that opposition remains entirely off-stage, so the decisive change is more design choice than dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure (anchored in the attic present with interleaved wartime backstory) is clean and easy to follow, and orientation is established early. The causal/emotional throughline—fleeing her reputation, destroying her own records, then being confronted with evidence she failed to erase—lands in a clear before/after shift at the envelope reveal. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from erasure to integration, crystallized by re-reading her younger self’s instructions on training birds “to return not to places but to people.” The only limitation is that the arc is very smooth; pressure rises more gently than a top-tier piece might manage.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: terrace overview → descent into maze → decoding journey → threshold discovery → conceptual reweighting of her father’s fate. Causality is solid under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: logbook symbols and grain-reading drive each turn, culminating in the center clearing and the pressure-differential threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—she reframes loss as inhabiting a liminal state—and the cost is her acceptance that her father truly crossed over. There are no orientation issues or broken setups; the piece keeps its promises within its lyrical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: feather → descent to dome → luminous event → contemplative closure, all anchored in a single continuous window with a small temporal reach-back. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; the alignment explanation, the city's response, and Mira's interpretive role all interlock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira redefines her aim from solving to inhabiting mystery—with the city's darkening functioning as a clear cadence. Stakes remain largely contemplative rather than pressured, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: we watch her move through the cave, work with crater glass, reflect, then encounter sprouts that reconfigure her core question. Orientation is clean (who/where/what she’s doing are anchored early), and the single-scene structure is cohesive. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing of “paths disappearing” into “paths changing form,” with the cost implicit in her acceptance that the work is endless and that forgetting encroaches. The turn is quiet and more philosophical than dramatic, but it’s legible and satisfying for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: repeated “acts” of performance build a pattern that’s repriced at the end when the tide erases the stage, leaving his ongoing method as the closure unit. Causality is modest but coherent—each new audience type leads to a small tactical adjustment, and the teenager sequence is the clearest “turn.” Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration works: tomorrow will be “same time, same place, but nothing would be identical,” which reframes all prior calibrations. The main limitation is that no single beat decisively tightens options or extracts a visible on-page cost, so the arc remains more vignette than story.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene accumulative structure: preparation → ritual activation → full cosmic transformation → charged decision to continue despite impending capture. Causality is intact (dust → dance → energy signature → authorities will come), and the closure has cost: she will be gone by dawn, leaving only her imprint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the ending’s Charged Poise (dancing on under a death/eradication sentence) is clear and effective. Escalation is more atmospheric than event-driven, but it still tightens around that final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc with a stable focalization and a clear dominant stake: the impending demolition versus what Marcus can salvage in meaning. Causality is modest but coherent: noctilucent clouds prompt prior insight, which frames his current ritual with the stones and leads to the decision to document and teach before the bulldozers arrive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn—he cannot save the building, but he redefines his “true work” and commits to a course of action. The cost (loss of the atrium and shop) is explicit, though the narrative doesn’t press him into hard tactical trade-offs beyond that acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure—one reflective night walk interwoven with a crucial backstory fire and the gift of the box—holds cleanly under a largely accumulative/causal lens. Closure is clear: the box’s meaning is repriced, and Marcus’s role shifts from technician-instructor to translator of pain, with the decision to record the message as the decisive act. Causality between beats (scar, bargain, rookie’s death, box, new teaching stance) is tight. The piece is intentionally quiet but still lands a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the arrival of the gauge, discovery of the grotto’s properties, iterative experiments, and tonight’s more ambitious configuration build coherently toward the confluence and realization. Causality under the textural lens holds—the lantern patterns, tides, and gauge behavior are all motivated and pay off in the grandmother’s revelation and Marina’s decision. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: hope reframed as ascent through parallel possibilities, with Marina shifting from private quest to teaching others. The main limitation is the near-total absence of resistance or jeopardy, which keeps turns from feeling truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: corridor → threshold → discovery of diaries → revelation of the hidden archive → methodical extraction → notebook bequeathal. Each step causally follows the previous, and the film strip/diary revelations form a coherent mid-story turn. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external event, with Mira repositioning herself in the lineage by leaving her own record. Stakes and cost are modest but legible within the quiet, accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in time and place, with a cumulative/textural drive as repetition (painting, song, heartbeat) tightens toward the sparrow’s song. Causality between her “possibility paintings” and the jammed bells is suggestive but legible enough to feel intentional rather than random. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the sparrow’s lullaby and the strengthening heartbeat reconfigure the stakes from desperate attempt to credible contact, though Sophia’s fate remains open. The cost is mostly conceptual (ongoing risk, devotion) rather than sharply dramatized in the final beat, holding it below elite-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from ritual setup through Mara’s intervention to a charged, reweighted final image. Causality is coherent—her choice to subvert the ritual leads to challenge, then to communal recognition of shared loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the terrace and clipboard shift from pure failure to tentative connective tissue, with a conceptual cost (relinquishing heroic self-images). The piece does lean more on rhetorical turn than dramatized consequence, which slightly softens structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, causally coherent mission: engineered drought → revealed map → burial of the egg → conceptual turn on preservation-as-destruction. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: we re-see every prior “atrocity” as a deliberate and costly act of curation. The causal links (drought → cracks → acoustic fossil beds → burial) are legible and satisfying. The main limitation is that structural pressure remains relatively flat—there’s no significant mid-story complication or reversal, just deepening exposition of an already-set plan.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: courtyard → threads → door → sanctuary → release → aftermath, with each step causally linked. The closure is a clear conceptual and situational shift—she has emptied the sanctuary, absorbed the echoes, and left the Academy’s system, with implied costs to her safety and identity. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds well as each untied thread deepens the pressure. The one limitation is that external consequences remain mostly implied rather than lightly dramatized or glimpsed at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous, well-oriented scene framed by the aftermath of an argument and preparation for tomorrow’s performance. The drive is accumulative/textural—each paragraph layers ethical and aesthetic stakes toward the meteor-hush closure. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing: he recasts the argument as material, reaffirming his method under the weight of inherited stories. Still, the on-page turn is modest, with little sense of options narrowing or consequences sharpening beyond what we’re initially told.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → construction of signals → arrival and reading by the monarch → dissolution and descent, with no orientation issues. Causality is quiet but present (her structures enable the monarch to read and carry the history), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the cost of ephemerality is accepted and reframed as appropriate tribute. The dominant drive is textural/accumulative rather than event-driven, but the final before/after (unencoded vs. encoded history) is legible. Stakes stay small-scale and conceptual, which slightly limits impact at elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the card → recognition of its link to the rope → experimental rebraiding → bell casting → genealogical revelation → reconfigured stance toward preservation. Structure is linear, single-scene, and easy to follow, with no orientation issues in time or space. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elsa’s understanding of preservation and her role in her family’s chain decisively shifts, with the sanctum left behind and a new instrument and task in hand. The convenience of the card perfectly matching the rope and spelling her ancestor’s name leans a bit mythic/contrived, but within the story’s slightly numinous register it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: bunker entry → descent and interface → Chen’s explanation → conceptual flip about time → exit with reconfigured understanding, with the storm and flooding as parallel pressure. The backward-time reveal and “you were remembering the future” reframe earlier beats without contradiction, and the wafer seal’s reinterpretation pays off nicely. Closure functions as a strong conceptual repricing with on-page cost in the loss of “choice” as meaningful category. The one weakness is reliance on a dense explanatory block from Chen rather than fully dramatizing discovery, but it doesn’t break structure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: years of study → locating the chamber → interpreting the magic square and star maps → activating the palace → first contact. Orientation is excellent and the single-scene structure flows naturally into a decisive, legible closure where the beacon comes online. The main weakness is the lack of complication or resistance—every step works on first try, so escalation feels somewhat pre-ordained rather than hard-won. Still, the before/after (silence vs contact) is conceptually strong and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: broken box → Marcus’ plan → Vera’s warning → Magistrate’s arrival → tactile confrontation → internal shift that saves the son. The closure—a decisive inner change in the Magistrate with explicit consequence for his son’s fever—lands clearly and on the page, even if the cure is partly inferred. The piece holds a consistent causal lens with some accumulative texture from the sanctuary’s memory, and there are no serious orientation issues. The only limitation is that the conflict feels almost too perfectly optimized for Marcus’ method, so structural risk is low.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: stranger arrives with need, Elara proposes a method, they enact it, a vision manifests and collapses, and she reframes the goal via the hand mirror. Causality is tight and legible, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after in how the dream is held. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the dream shifts from something to recapture to something to carry. The main limitation is that the on-page cost of this shift is more gentle than pressured, keeping the arc just shy of the most powerful forms of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: breached contract → summons → Elara returns → discovers failing quartz eyes → uses “wrong” bag → mends and teaches → renewed cathedral. Closure is solid, a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration as Elara resumes her art and passes it on, with implied cost in defying the Council and relinquishing isolation. Structure stays within a single coherent scene with a brief, well-anchored backstory insertion. Escalation is slightly underpowered, as the mending proceeds without a significant setback or complication once she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: mysterious object → impossible place → encounter with self → bathroom retreat → conceptual revelation → reweighted return to the orchard. The loop logic—object appears in ledger, coordinates lead her to the future/self-caused origin—is legible and satisfying as a Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is soft but consistent under an accumulative/textural lens; there are no orientation issues or broken rules. The main limitation is that the inciting question (“What is this shell?”) resolves more via exposition than via pressured choice, keeping it below elite-level structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: diary → door → maze → trap room → frozen seekers → negotiation, with a clear before/after reconfiguration once the mountain accepts Mira’s proposal. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and closure is unambiguous: the library’s function is transformed and the seekers are freed. The main weakness is that the negotiation feels almost frictionless—no real doubt that the mountain might refuse, which softens the sense of risk. Still, for this length the structural arc is coherent, efficient, and lands its turn.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece has a clean causal spine: mysterious card → journey to ship → confrontation with twin → choice about remembering, with no major logic gaps. Structure is linear and tight for the length, and the garden’s rules are sketched just enough to support the ending without over-explaining. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the decision to carry the card out rather than pin it—and the cost (inevitable fading of Coraline’s features and partial forgetting) is legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Hybrid, leaning accumulative/textural, but remains coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: seal → rope reconfiguration → progressive revelations → deadline of the thirteenth chime → decision to step through. The structure is a single, coherent scene with accumulative discoveries that reweight the situation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a decisive act—she embraces the paradoxical merged space—though the personal or practical cost of that choice is only lightly implied. The drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds consistently from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: threat established, investigation of cracks, discovery and extraction of the bloom, and a rebalanced aftermath, all in one continuous scene. Causality is coherent and accumulative, with each physical action (reading ice, using the stone, performing the ritual) leading naturally to the next. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the caves’ soundscape and the beings’ behavior are altered, and the protagonist’s understanding is slightly reweighted. The main limitation is that the cost of failure and the risk of her actions stay somewhat abstract rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: long vigil → silent impact → altered retrocognitive vision → repair and reorientation of the beacon → ships answering. The piece lands an on-page closure that is both a decisive change (beacon rekindled, ships returning) and a conceptual repricing of what the beacon must be. Cost is more historical than immediate—the seventeen lost years and her isolation—yet it’s legible enough at the end. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with a brief, well-handled backstory shard; no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates from observation to insight, closing on a clear resonant reconfiguration about what makes them human. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: stimuli (lightning, crystals, fog-stone) feed reflection, which in turn motivates the act of inscribing new memory. Closure lands on the page with a legible before/after shift in Lyra’s understanding and stance. The piece could benefit from one sharper on-page turn or obstacle to intensify the path to that realization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Kaia arrives, recognizes the note, connects with the artist, mobilizes the community, and achieves a reconfigured status quo. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a modest causal spine, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration of the fortress’s emotional state. Costs are relatively soft (time, labor, Kaia’s prior trade of her last rocket design), and no turn seriously threatens failure, so the arc feels safe. Still, within the short form, the progression is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: one continuous scene, clearly anchored, with a conversational progression that culminates in Chen’s implied decision to return. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: past work → Chen’s discovery/retreat → present confrontation → reconfiguration of his stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise, with the pools “foretelling” his return and the cicada passing between them. The main limitation is that the cost of this decision, while conceptually present, is not strongly dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: pre-inversion anticipation → inversion and doll’s transformation → harvesting sequence → post-inversion resolve, with each stage causally following the last. The closure is a conceptual repricing: a redefinition of safety and a new intention toward her father, clearly tethered to the inversion experience. Stakes stay modest but coherent; nothing important is left dangling, and the single-scene window is well-contained. The main ceiling comes from the low tangible cost—her success is total, so the before/after relies almost entirely on interior reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous gondola ride with a clear beginning (embarkation in distress), middle (guided passage through sound-altering terraces), and end (changed relation to the train whistle). Causality is coherent—Marcus’s decisions about route, speed, and when to speak produce the woman’s progressive easing and the terraces’ “response.” Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by the final train whistle she listens without flinching, which clearly reweights the opening loneliness motif. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (facing internal noise), not dramatized as a hard trade-off, which keeps it below elite-level intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: waterfall → orchard → shed → peeling paint → revelation → dawn ritual, all cohering to a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. The sunrise “deadline” converts nicely into a reframed payoff (witnessing the ritual rather than racing a catastrophe), which fits the more contemplative drive lens. The cost is conceptual—abandoning the fantasy of a throne rather than gaining it—and that before/after is legible. The piece could feel more pressurized if any step genuinely threatened failure or misinterpretation rather than unfolding smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: shadows encroach, she engages and transforms one, then the pattern extends to another as purpose and cost clarify. Causality within the scene is coherent and the closure forms a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—she recommits to the same work with reweighted meaning around thresholds and burning bridges. Stakes remain largely conceptual, and the central encounter with the suffocated shadow resolves smoothly without a tangible complication or hard choice on the page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, but escalation and explicit cost at the ending are muted.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: glitchy messages + farm environment → promise-convergence → bolt-turn → conceptual reframe and light-diamonds, yielding a solid Conceptual Repricing closure. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation issues and a clean escalation to the converging promises. The biggest weakness is that the key mechanics (the bolt as key, the multiversal consensus that the scheme was a “filter”) arrive as convenient revelations, softening the sense of earned cost. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and the structure holds under a mostly causal/accumulative hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: handle → record → ancestral revelations → clear binary choice → physical renunciation and plan to relinquish the estate. Closure lands as a decisive change plus an earned stasis: she chooses not to pursue mastery and instead forecloses the dynasty, with an on-page cost in power, heritage, and certainty. The single-scene structure is tight, with backstory anchored to present stimuli (the standing waves, the room) and no orientation issues. The only thing holding it short of the very top band is that the external consequences of her choice remain largely projected rather than partially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene that escalates from entry to oath to full ontological transformation, with solid causal links (reading the program → speaking the oath → activation of marionettes → metamorphosis). Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change with visible cost—his armor and body unsnapped from necessity and a new, constrained role as guardian. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the ending honors that by reweighting everything around the choice to inhabit possibility rather than a single world. The only limitation is that the initial setup of why this must happen now (after seven years) feels slightly under-motivated, softening the sense of structural inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dust → button → file → note → realization of another searcher → reaffirmed mission, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Marcus commits to reading his mother’s file through the same lens of small kindnesses. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—the discoveries deepen his stance rather than trigger plot reversals. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the archives shift from bureaucratic graveyard to a living language of care, with an implicit cost in his solitude. Stakes remain modest and internal, but the before/after in his orientation to these histories is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow: puddle-map → key → tunnel → archive → upload → reemergence, with a clear before/after in the world’s knowledge state. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing: the rebellion redefines itself from failed cell action to distributed evidence war. However, escalation is somewhat schematic: obstacles are asserted (“They’re coming”) but never materially impede progress, and the raid on the main cell happens off-page. The cost—leaders’ arrest as “distraction”—is more told than felt, softening the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: discovery of the prophecy → plan to use negative space → collective non-performance → temporary silencing and a charged recognition that the threat will return. The accumulative structure (foggy approach → ritual restraint → dewdrops carrying syllables away) supports a clear before/after: the prophecy’s active spread vs. its enforced sleep. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a decisive victory, and the cost is the musicians’ commitment to permanent silence in key parts of their art. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (no concrete on-page consequence of failure), but the structure itself is coherent and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: moonstone speck → monuments → leaves’ messages → revelation → transformed role is a clean throughline under a textural drive lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s identity and purpose are reweighted, and the final image of mossed, enlivened arbor clearly marks a before/after. Causality is more mythic than logistical, but links remain legible (e.g., the prod → bell → leaves converge → understanding). Cost and concrete stakes are muted, so the transformation reads more as graceful elevation than a hard-won, pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: clocks that never work → anomalous ticking → experimental integration of the compass → greenhouse revelation → redefined calling. Causality is coherent at each step, and the closure is a conceptual repricing where “repair” is redefined with visible consequences for how Marcus deals with visitors. The global drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable; the pattern of clocks, water, and leaves tightens toward the final stance. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Vera seeks Mira after the search ends, the coin activates, and the alchemical ritual reconfigures Mira’s understanding of herself. The piece delivers a clear closure via conceptual repricing—names and “burden” are reweighted in the final image. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat low-pressure (failure never feels truly possible once Vera arrives), but the single-scene structure is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal throughline—Mara waits for the right dawn, follows the harp, elicits confession, and guides Thomas to release—is clean and satisfying for a single-scene piece. Closure is solid: Thomas’s reoriented relationship to error lets him dissolve into the sunrise, resolving the central tether. The crocodile tooth’s warm–hot–cool progression underlines structure without over-explaining. The main limitation is that the path to resolution feels very smooth, with no serious doubt about success, so the decisive turn doesn’t quite bite as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: anesthesia wearing off → orientation in exile station → decision to leave → encounter with the child, culminating in a thematic reframing. Causality within a situational/accumulative lens holds: her enhanced awareness leads to recognizing inverse equations of pain, which motivates her choice in the forest. Closure as a resonant reconfiguration is present in her repurposing of interrogation mathematics for teaching mercy, with the pewter strap left behind as a before/after marker. Stakes remain largely internal and philosophical, so structural turns feel more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the stall → recognition of the anomaly → excavation of the painting’s layers → discovery of the map → commitment to act, with causal links holding throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: Mira leaves with the map and a charged intention to rewrite visibility for the erased culture via the fog. The conceptual cost—taking responsibility for powerful, fragile histories—is present but somewhat underplayed; there is no real counter-pressure pushing her to refuse. Still, the throughline is coherent and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost appears as mechanism fails → Marcus applies his specialized observational method → discovers hidden journal cache → understands conspiracy and grandmother’s role → commits to exposing it, allowing the ghosts to rest. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his quest to “discover what ceilings hide” gains concrete social stakes and personal lineage. The cost—stepping into a dangerous, exhausting whistleblower role—is mostly conceptual and could be sharpened, but it’s legible. Structure holds as a tight single-scene investigation with integrated backstory rather than digression.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: daily routine → anomalous bottle → after-hours decision → uncorking and reality shift → dissolution and reconfigured cosmos. Causality is clear within the lyric, negotiable-reality frame, and the ending delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing as the library’s destruction becomes the mechanism for seeding new stories. The bottle’s paradox destabilizes the filing system in a way that logically forces some kind of radical response. The cost of that response—the sinking and dissolution of the library—is on the page and legible as the before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: dispute over ownership → Cassia’s challenge to protocol → supernatural demonstration → reframed stakes and a plan. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which Cassia’s understanding of defeat and purpose crystallizes, with visible future cost implied in “change everything” and confronting the Institute. The institutional risk and potential backlash are mostly gestured at rather than concretely pressured in-scene, which softens impact. Structure is otherwise tight and orientation is excellent from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that escalates logically from delicate repair → growing interference → direct confrontation → world-shifting result. Causality is strong, with the resonance chamber, mirrors, and chip all set up and then paid off in the climax, and closure is decisive (curse broken, dawn restored). The main weakness is that the success feels almost frictionless once Vex arrives; his abrupt disintegration removes opposition rather than sharpening a final choice. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: factory shuts → access to caves → lagoon discovery → psychometric reading → revelation of Hartley’s fate and the doorway → choice to withdraw with a sample. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she knowingly leaves the door unopened for now, carrying a charged object back to the surface. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, framed as delayed transcendence rather than a sharply felt sacrifice on the page. Structure is otherwise tight and linear, with no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a tight single-scene progression where GPS failure → shelter → discovery of the slide → collaborative carving → realization forms a clean accumulative arc. The drive lens is predominantly Accumulative/Textural: each layered perception of timewoven artists deepens the central premise rather than producing sharp causal reversals. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marina’s relationship to learning, time, and guidance (GPS vs. “turbine-hum”) is clearly reweighted with a soft but legible cost (she relinquishes reliance on technological certainty). Stakes remain modest and internal, but the before/after is articulate and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative, moving through the seasons and the pavilion project toward a conceptual turn on the solstice. Causality is legible—finding the postcards leads to the commission, to nocturnal work, to understanding the lineage and passing it on. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the postcards as instructions and chooses to become a link in an ongoing chain. The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual, but the before/after is clear and satisfying for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is strong: encrypted diary → retrocognitive trap → conversation with Marcus → descent to lagoon → pattern-making → realization and release. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (situational + conceptual), and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing of what “encryption” and “truth” mean. Transitions between past/present at the lagoon are legible and purposeful. The only thing keeping this from a higher band is that the emotional and practical costs of choosing to reveal these truths are mostly projected, not yet tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured around a single decision: how Silas will use the bottle in the ruined town, with backstory anchored and causally relevant. The because/therefore chain is solid: wish drags him here → he finds town and bottle → he chooses a harder, inward method → this seeds the town’s revival. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s potential is reweighted, and Silas’s purpose is defined, with conceptual cost on the page. The main limitation is the near-total absence of obstacles or reversals once he commits to the method, which flattens late-scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: rooftop frame → memory and backstory → discovery and test of shaving → prophetic revelation → tower crack → all-night work → charged morning closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality holds: his choice to restore the shaving unlocks the prophecy, which in turn compels the rosetta transcription and the decision to enshrine the object. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: time and prophecy are reinterpreted as pattern-recognition across languages, with real cost in his acceptance that the world is ending but his work is complete. The only small limit is that the physical jeopardy (rising water, tower crack) never quite constrains his tactics on the page as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story runs as a clean, single-scene arc under a mostly causal lens: egg-hatching → vortex manifestation → acorn-cap key → stabilization → garden reopening. Orientation is excellent and the closure unit (reconstituting the garden and planting the cap) is clear, with a legible before/after. What’s missing for a higher band is a stronger sense of jeopardy or potential failure in the middle; the process unfolds smoothly, so the “could unravel causality” danger never meaningfully constrains tactics. Cost at the end is mostly conceptual (responsibility, power) rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that escalates from quiet monitoring to decisive alarm, with a clear before/after in the avalanche’s release. Causality is strong (strange readings → stone vibration/animal behavior → decision to ring → evacuation → avalanche), and closure lands with a legible cost and outcome. The “storm from within the mountain” twist is integrated by earlier pressure anomalies, not a late rule change. The main limitation is that the risk of false alarm never manifests as a concrete obstacle, so the climactic choice doesn’t quite tighten as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—routine observation → impossible still star → deepening engagement → star’s transformation → renewed purpose—reads clean and coherent. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Kepler-9’s role and past suffering are conceptually repriced through the encounter. Cost is present conceptually (three centuries of loneliness re-understood) but not freshly incurred in the final movement, which keeps the ending more contemplative than cutting. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: ghosts appear → Mara discovers the stained glass box → backstory reframes the covenant → realization and acceptance of a new role. The causal links are legible under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is reinterpreted as silence to be tended rather than a contract to be enforced. Reflection/backstory is anchored to present stimuli (ghost movements, the box, the documents) and does not blur orientation. The only limit is that external stakes remain low-key, so the “turn” is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clear causal throughline: arrival at the silo → discovery of capsule and ads → discovery of urn fragment → revelation of Voss’s network → Marcus embracing his role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: a before/after in Marcus’s understanding of his purpose and the world’s new temporal logic. Cost is implied (living on borrowed time in service of others) but not concretely pressed on the page, and external resistance is minimal. The accumulative/textural drive fits, yet the lack of a sharper on-page price or complication keeps this below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: lagoon after storm → feather attention → kite tension → string snap → encounter → shared reframing → written realization. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, with the kite snap as the clear tightening beat and the final notebook line as a Conceptual Repricing closure. Cost is gentle but present—the boy’s loss and Mira’s ongoing choice to live amid brokenness. No orientation or lens-clarity issues, but the arc remains modest in dramatic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diagnosis → diary → three weeks of work → copper network completion → realization of the caretaker’s true role → plan for trustees. Closure works as a conceptual repricing: dying becomes a specialized function, and the temple shifts from building to living council, with a clear cost (her imminent death and lifelong pattern of caretakers). The structure is mostly a single, continuous scene interwoven with reflection, and the “trustees arriving tomorrow” adds a modest, if mostly anticipatory, external clock.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal throughline: tower arrival → data confrontation → amber revelation → planetary network understanding → conceptual revaluation of “first contact” and pilgrimage. The closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: humanity’s spiritual history is reframed as an experiment, with a clear before/after in Elena’s understanding and a conceptual cost (loss of unscripted agency). Structure is linear, well-oriented, and the final turn (“We’re the experiment”) pays off earlier hints about synthetic neurochemistry and tagged sites. The only limitation is that much of the action is intellectual and expository rather than dramatized through concrete choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → historical context of reef/war → ritual planting → projected future reclamation → departure. Causality holds (dead reef → nutrients → his realization → action), and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing of battlefield into garden, with the last images reweighting everything that came before. The piece remains essentially one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored backstory; orientation is never in doubt. The main limitation is that no real alternative path or risk is dramatized, so the decisive “change” is conceptual rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clear: child’s gift → phonograph revelation → decision to leave the Heap → journey → discovery of the valley and new role. The drive lens is primarily causal with a thematic overlay, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Sage’s function in the world decisively changes. The before/after is legible and carries conceptual cost—she abandons her “retirement” and former identity to take on a new, demanding purpose. Escalation is somewhat linear and smooth, but the structure is clean, with no orientation debt or serious causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-moment action at the deck, intercut with specific backstory about the family star-mapping ritual and the grandmother’s “true north” philosophy, all converging on Kira’s decision to use the sketch as a temporal map. Causality holds within the speculative frame: shutdown → temporal rupture → Kira’s unique perception + compass → deliberate sketch → crewmates reorienting toward her. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she becomes a fixed point/lighthouse for others, with a conceptual and emotional cost (accepting pariah-hood as duty). The main limitation is that the cost and risk attached to her act remain relatively soft and abstract, so the ending feels more assured than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: wrong sky → recalled instruction → ascent to spire → confrontation with the Keeper’s test → choice to amend the board → earned endorsement and altered sky. Structure stays focused in a single scene with relevant flashback, and the test’s terms are legible without over-explaining world rules. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the board and sky are redefined, and Renn’s path diverges decisively from her master’s. The primary weakness is the low sense of concrete jeopardy if she fails, which keeps the cost more implied than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: Marina’s ritual is established, then the external call to testify interrupts, and her decision to remain in the gallery functions as an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. Causality is clear under a textural lens: the interregnum and her public miscasting have led to her private practice of witnessing, so the government’s request becomes a meaningful test. Closure lands in the final “W-E R-E-M-A-I-N” image, which crisply reconfigures the initial sanctuary as a chosen, costly position. There are no orientation issues or broken set-ups; the quietness of the turn is deliberate rather than underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: stone arrives → guides descent → discovery of soil chamber → choice to plant → time jump to the garden’s impact. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure (choosing to grow futures rather than merely see them) is decisively on the page with emotional cost. The brief epilogue months later pays off the setup without feeling expository. Escalation remains mostly internal and gentle, so the arc is strong but not structurally breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: rumor → arrival at the time-freeze → engagement with the tapestry and board → realization of mirrored error → self-repricing and departure. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with well-handled backstory that clarifies stakes without derailing the present moment, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he cannot change the village or past, only his stance). The magic mechanism (threads alter board, woven hush enabling access) is conceptually coherent if lightly sketched, and it pays off at the precise point of Kaspar’s shift. The main structural limitation is that external stakes never truly tighten, so momentum is driven almost entirely by reflective insight rather than escalating situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored in the canyon, with one brief, functional backstory insert, and a clear before/after (canyon as prison vs. transmitter). Causality is coherent—childhood discovery → plan → climb → resonance chamber repurposed—and the closure reads as a conceptual repricing where the ritual space is permanently altered. The main weakness is the low felt cost: the Silencers arrive, but there is no confrontation or real moment where her plan might fail on-page. Still, the piece lands a legible, contained arc appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: a single scene with a ticking-clock environment, causal beats (charm in statue → memories reveal → statue awakens → platform fails → plunge) and a clear closure where Mira dies but the story is preserved. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure from the acid/gear failure plus accumulative memory-texture), held consistently. Cost is unequivocal—her life—articulated in the plunge and “last moments between air and acid,” with a reweighted premise about brokenness as transformation. The only restraint on a higher score is that escalation is very linear and slightly predictable; there’s no surprising structural turn beyond the expected activation-then-collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain—cracked mirror → deviation from routine → hidden cove and cave → journal revelation → new shell and return—is clean and coherent. The piece reads as primarily accumulative/textural, but the structural turn at the cave and the journal entry about the cracked mirror give a satisfying sense of design without feeling mechanical. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina’s understanding of her life’s work and her grandmother’s disappearance is reweighted with emotional cost. The “prophetic” precision of the journal entry flirts with convenience but doesn’t derail the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: heat wave → thinned reality → discovery of Thomas’s state → months of intentional work → dawn ritual with the vial → his partial return. The dominant drive is causal with an accumulative lyrical layer, and closure is a clear Decisive Change: Thomas crosses from in-between to embodied presence, redefining their options. Stakes remain focused and contained—emotional rather than large-scale—but are consistently honored. The cost of three years’ vigil and his altered, not-fully-human state is on the page and gives the ending bite.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece is cleanly structured around a single night’s work at the signal station: hydraulics fail → she improvises with the censer foot and calls → pressure peaks with Diego’s call → she chooses to remain as navigator. Causality is tight (the mechanical failure forces manual labor; calls drive incremental movement of the array) and orientation is excellent from the opening line. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts a static, costly role while the world moves. A slight limitation is that the macro-stakes of the reverse migration stay mostly implicit, with little concrete consequence shown on-page when guidance fails.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: descent to the ravine → discovery of box → preparation of cure → test on herself → new plan to distribute. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and clear, and the story maintains a single continuous scene with reflective interludes that stay anchored in present action. Closure is decisive change plus conceptual repricing: Mara’s compulsion is lifted and she redefines what honesty should mean after the virus, with a clear cost in remembered harms. The only limitation is that opposition is mostly environmental and historical rather than active in the moment, which keeps structural pressure from feeling truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: stranger’s plunge → resistant boutonniere → rotational gaps → temporal coordinates → cache of objects → realization of theft and return of Magnus’s own memories. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph; we always know where and when we are and what Magnus is trying to do. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his isolation is the same in fact but not in meaning, and the cost of decades lost with his family is legible. The main weakness is the slightly expository dump (“The stranger had been their son…”) where a highly charged realization is told rather than discovered in more dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: chip arrives → glimmer triggers memory → rising creek and ants → hidden cavern → doorway and map of unrealized choices → decision to step through and reconfigure his life. The piece maintains a single, clean POV and one continuous progression with no orientation issues. Closure is a real Decisive Change with a visible before/after state, plus an implied ongoing cost in the lives not taken and the shop left behind. A slight sense of ease in the transition from vision to decision trims the ceiling a bit.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: warning → climb → revelation of ancestral bargain → forced choice → sacrifice → cyclical handoff to the princess. Causality is tight and easy to follow, with no orientation issues and one continuous scene culminating in an on-page decisive change. Closure is strong: Seraphina’s transformation and the princess beginning to dream form a clear before/after with conceptual and emotional cost. The only limitation is that the choice feels somewhat foreordained once the grotto states the terms, reducing suspense around alternative outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene moving from failed experiment, through re-framing, to breakthrough, with a clear before/after in Lyra’s understanding of presence. Causality is consistent—her emotional realization directly alters her scientific tactics, which changes the experiment’s outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: presence as echo rather than capture, with the final image of the shell-sun and their shared stance. The main limitation is that the breakthrough arrives on the first conceptual shift without any real risk of failure or complication, which slightly softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: cabin → scroll → grave memory → decision to write → step into the wind → looping return to chronicling, with a clear conceptual before/after around accepting narrative-as-chaos. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, and the final image functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a plot twist. Orientation is clear—who, where, what’s happening—despite time’s slipperiness, which is the point. The only limitation is that stakes and constraints don’t narrow so much as echo, so closure is resonant but not sharply cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: found object → revelation of its origin → shared reading of the clock → reinstallation and reconfiguration of meaning. Causality holds at every step; nothing feels arbitrary, and the closure—Mara integrating the screw and reframing repair as “integration of damage”—functions as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. The drive lens is textural rather than plot-twist driven, but the before/after in Mrs. Huang’s relationship to the clock and her daughter is legible. A slightly clearer moment of on-page decision stakes for Mara herself (what if she chose not to keep using the tool) would deepen the sense of structural consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense exam scene with a single, well-anchored flashback that directly alters present tactics. Causality is tight—stress → crystallization → memory of rhyme → reinterpretation → new rune → shedding of crystals—and the closure is a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration. Stakes are internal but coherent and scaled to the form, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities. The only limitation is that external stakes remain modest, which keeps the structural ambition short-form rather than fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain from summons → confrontation → collaboration → completion → departure. Orientation is excellent—who, where, when, and what’s at stake (orchard, tethering energies, deadline) are anchored early and never muddled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Vera’s entire notion of exorcism is reweighted, Elisabetta leaves permanently, and the completed requiem remains as the cost-shaped artifact. The only limit keeping this from a higher band is that the resolution proceeds quite smoothly once the premise is laid out, with little structural surprise or complication beyond the expected beat progression.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: universe hiccup → recognition of maya → spiral walk → reading “Unify” → conceptual repricing at “Continue.” Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and maintained despite the non-Euclidean setting and lyric tone. Closure is solidly on-page as a conceptual repricing: endings redefined as iterations, with the universe’s “hiccup” reweighted as doubt rather than death, though the cost of this insight remains mostly conceptual. The inner deadline (“three thousand heartbeats”) is underused dramatically, but the causal/associative progression holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: whistle → ritual countdown → hydraulic response → conceptual realization → logbook entry, all in one continuous scene with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated mechanical-hydraulic details and memories build toward the final redefinition of time as distance. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing with a clear before/after in her understanding, though the cost is more implied than viscerally felt. The stakes never move beyond contemplative, which keeps the structure from feeling truly high-stakes despite its elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: discovery of an impossible anomaly → interpretation of its implications → personal reconfiguration culminating in the phone call. Causality is solid under a Hybrid/accumulative lens: her professional scrutiny leads to the scientific insight, which then reframes her emotional stance. Closure lands via both a decisive act (calling Chen) and a conceptual repricing of “security,” with legible emotional cost. The main limitation is that obstacles remain mostly internal and resolve with relative ease, so tension never tightens dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure in the library framed by brief, anchored backstory and the cryptic subway messages. Causality is clear: decoding the messages → coming to the library → meeting the woman → choosing to write her own message. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she redefines the relationship between gambling and math and commits to participating in the underground society. The cost is internal and thematic rather than plot-driven, but it is legible and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece runs as an accumulative/textural design: one night’s routine call that crystallizes an ongoing pattern, with clean orientation and no causality breaks. The Eleanor call provides a modest tightening when she voices doubt about her daughter, and the ending lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he recommits to the loop with clear implications of isolation and duty. Closure is quiet but legible: tomorrow will be the same, and that choice is reweighted as both service and self-erasure. The main limitation is that the “turn” is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the structure strong but not strikingly dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Eleanor’s request → Mara’s research into the fire → discovery of Thomas’s culpability → three-day moral steeping → the codicil decision at the jetty. The story keeps a single, continuous scene framed by a brief but well-anchored backstory reflection; the jetty moment is clearly “now,” with the past continually reweighting present options. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: Mara both upholds the covenant and permanently inscribes the erased victims into its margins, with a clear before/after in what “preservation” means. The cost—Mara choosing to bind Eleanor’s solace to a record of Thomas’s harm—is felt in the locket exchange and the “gift and a burden” phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Sadie seeds rumor → Marcus arrives with coffee and rock → trade → phone responsibility → implied future calls, culminating in a clear before/after for Marcus. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s role in the world is reweighted, with cost (loss of heirloom, acceptance of ongoing obligation). The “economy of reciprocity” through the phone and moon rock binds the beats together without loose set-ups. Stakes are modest but coherent, and the ending’s charged poise at the platform is structurally satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—moving through the forest, following an incomplete melody, arriving at the stillpoint, then returning transformed—is clear and coherent. Causality holds on a conceptual level: the journey and sensory gathering enable the final reconfiguration where she internalizes the stillpoint. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what mapping and navigation mean for her. The main weakness is that the path to the climax is nearly frictionless, so the decisive change arrives without any real pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean and the causal chain—past misinterpretation → study of anomaly → realization it edits reality → rescue ship decision—is coherent and legible. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the act of sending both coordinate sets reframes reality choice rather than resolving it neatly. The cost of this “both realities” move, however, is somewhat under-articulated; implications for the rescue outcome are largely elided into abstraction. The structure holds under a mostly causal/Conceptual lens, but an extra beat of concrete consequence would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: a single night’s work at the harbor, seeded with compact backstory, builds toward a clear reconfiguration of what “music” and “beginning” mean for Maya. Causality is quiet but coherent—Maya’s long project → Chen’s recognition → their collaborative “concert” → Maya’s final reframing of silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with visible emotional cost (accepting that what returns may not be sound, and that an audience of one might be enough). A slightly sharper mid-beat hinge or small external complicating pressure could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—arsons → clues in vandalized images → trail → archive → realization—reads clean and coherent. Structure is accumulative but still basically causal, and the ending offers a clear conceptual repricing: she redefines her role and the meaning of “preservation.” The major weakness is that much of the plot is summarized backstory, with no present-tense complication in the archive to generate a meaningful turn. Closure lands conceptually, but without an on-page test or price beyond reiterated social misperception.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: injection → entry into the shared space → realization of the true purpose → exploitation of the drumming subnet → inversion of the experiment → irreversible transformation. The transition from lab to lagoon is legible, and the story maintains one dominant drive: whether Mira can subvert being harvested before she dies. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the memory-cage becomes a dream-nursery, with her death and irrevocable system change as clear costs. The only limitation is that the scientists’ counter-pressure is somewhat token—Chen’s attempt to terminate the session has little structural bite—so the climax feels a touch one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → system failure → urgent medical stake → Marcus’s specialized navigation → Chen’s recognition of his value and the coin handoff. Orientation is rock-solid from the opening sentences, and the story sustains a single-scene window with one dominant drive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Chen and the institution must now treat whispers as structurally powerful, with the coin as a concrete marker of that shift. The main limitation is that the path to the container is executed without real complication or near-failure, so the climax never quite tightens to maximum possible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with a causal/accumulative drive: Thomas’s unresolved confession leads to Mira’s intervention, which yields his reframed understanding and lighter exit. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the mechanics of shutters, mirror, and reflections build coherently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Thomas’s relationship to his “unsaid” words is decisively reweighted, with the mirror handoff crystallizing the before/after. The cost (letting go of cherished guilt and the imagined power of last words) is present but could be dramatized more sharply rather than mostly explained.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with woven backstory, leading causally from Marcus’s plan to the synchronized displays and the first wave of communal awakening. The global drive reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative thematic beats), and closure lands with a conceptual repricing: the town has irrevocably crossed a threshold of thought. However, the off-stage education director and the absence of any immediate repercussion soften the sense of paid cost; the rebellion ignites without tangible consequence. Orientation is strong from the opening, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: scrimshaw from the nets → Torven’s claim and backstory → night at the fringe → whale call and unbinding → Cetacea’s emergence → departure. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change (Mira leaving her old life and diving toward Cetacea) and a conceptual repricing (the island as always-present but only visible through authenticity). Stakes and rules are established early (Pacification, Cetacea myth) and paid off without late-breaking cheats. The only minor limitation is that conflict resolves relatively smoothly, with little resistance or complication once the call begins.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a tight single-session scene with a brief, well-anchored flash of backstory that directly frames the present stakes. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated narrated actions build toward a resonant reconfiguration: Mrs. Chen shifts from client to practitioner of the method. Closure lands clearly when she echoes the performer’s technique (“Now I am learning to breathe”), showing a before/after in how she holds grief. The cost—accepting an emotionally flattened surface as necessary cover—remains on the page and gives the final image bite.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: ban lifted → return to atrium → dance rewriting space → lake cracking → arrival of others → reconfigured world, with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. Cause-and-effect is legible and coherent within the magical logic, and the single-scene frame never disorients. The cost is mostly conceptual (loss of fixed forms and delay of seven years) rather than dramatized via hard choices or consequences, which softens impact. Still, the before/after distinction—frozen scripture vs. sky of doors—is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Mira’s need for space → barter attempt with the reed → revelation of the daughter → shared learning → flower message and sound sculpture → daughter’s return. The structure is mostly one anchored situation with an efficient “over the following weeks” compression that doesn’t disrupt orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: father and daughter reunited via the systems Mira helped build, with the phoenix reframed conceptually. The cost (time, emotional exposure, facing shame) is legible even if largely implied rather than dramatized in discrete crises.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival, re-evaluation via the lens, break from prescribed sequence, gathering of people, and a redefined role at closure. Causality is legible and accumulative: questioning → improvisation → unexpected audience → new understanding of connection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “pilgrimage,” with Vera’s future approach reoriented, though the cost of deviating from the ritual remains mostly implied rather than dramatized. The single-scene flow is tight and appropriate for the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one primary scene with interwoven backstory, all under a single lens of grief-as-transformation, and orientation is immediate (observatory, bench, candles). Causality is accumulative rather than plot-twist driven: house sale → rock bottom → observatory refuge → ritual of cranes → helping the new widow → poised decision about the tattoo. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she hasn’t yet enacted the tattoo, but her readiness and the crane marking the observatory reweight the preceding rituals with cost and hope. The conflict remains small in scale but the narrative does deepen meaningfully, rather than simply repeat its premise.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: a single causal conversation where Vera reveals her findings, Marcus’s understanding shifts, and the final beat reconfigures the premise into “architects of persistence.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, not a decisive change, with low on-page cost but a clear before/after in knowledge. There are no orientation or causality slips, but the plot remains intellectually tidy rather than dramatically pressured. As a result it feels like a polished scene-setting for a larger work, not a fully self-sufficient story at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: years of preparation → pattern-avoidance entry → progressive revelations in tiers → decision to absorb the plague → transmuted exit. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after: the archive’s purpose fulfilled and Mira permanently altered, which qualifies as a decisive change with cost. Escalation is mostly vertical through the tiers and the “guardians arriving soon” clock, though the guardians’ failure to actually complicate the climax feels slightly convenient. Still, the structure fits the length, with one coherent drive and a legible, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: research → pattern recognition → experiment with the stone/interface → encounter with the grandmother’s dream → clarified purpose. Causality under an accumulative lens is coherent, with each discovery leading naturally to the next without retroactive patching. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira’s understanding of what must be preserved expands, with an implied cost of lifelong devotion and the belatedness of her grandmother’s fulfillment. Stakes skew conceptual/emotional rather than situational, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: exposure by Dr. Chen leads to removing the chips, to the tail injury, to the reconstructive surgery, culminating in her decision to confess and accept consequences. The single continuous night structure, bracketed by starlight and dawn, gives a satisfying arc with a clear before/after—Marina moves from hiding to full admission. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis: she commits to rehoming the animals and turning herself in, with the cost (sanctuary loss, legal fallout) explicitly acknowledged. Structural ambitions are modest but fully met, with no orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: waking from anesthesia → recalling the displaced miracle → sensing through scars/plants → reconceiving miracles and wounds. Causality holds under a textural lens: each new perception (coffee ring, scars, garden, plant chorus) deepens the same drive rather than creating detached digressions. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—wounds as “invitation” and miracles traveling through “smaller doors”—with a clear before/after in her understanding and stance. Stakes stay interior and contemplative, so the arc feels more like deepening than sharp turning, but it’s coherent and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrive with mandate → psychometric immersion → discovery of the “goodbye letters” and Eleanor → decision to take the film and lie in the report. The accumulative/textural drive is well-handled; each new layer of letters and building-memory thickens pressure toward the final renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Vera reframes the job and accepts the cost of quietly stealing history from the demolition process. There are no causality breaks, though the external consequences of her choice remain implied rather than sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: orientation is immediate (Lyra, astrolabe, archway, aurora), and the causal chain from long quest → threshold crossing → liminal rest → final turn is coherent. The closure is decisive and legible: she completes the mechanism, breaks the prison, and pays with her existence. The global drive reads as a Hybrid with strong accumulative/lyric texture, and that lens holds through the end. Stakes and costs could be slightly more dramatized in the moment of decision—her choice never seriously wavers—otherwise this would edge even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: present-tense guarding frame → pirate intrusion → tactical response via song → reaffirmed mission, all in one contiguous scene. Causality under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens is solid: pirate appears, reaches for nightmare, Kess escalates her charm, reality selects her version. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise around the frozen clock and her choice to keep guarding, with a conceptual cost (she remains dreamless while tending others’ dreams). The stakes and the price at the end are clear but somewhat soft in felt consequence, keeping this just under the elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival → gear investigation → Loom Tree insertion → memory return → vow and future arrivals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the forest is reframed as a remembered rebellion and future site of awakening, with the ongoing cost of his enforced translocation. Structure is linear and lucid, but the stakes stay mostly conceptual, so the final turn feels intellectually elegant more than dramatically tight.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: inciting leash break → pursuit → encounter with guides → crossing → reconfigured return. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/lyric lens, with the crossing and ticket punch functioning as the central structural hinge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to “the same” place with altered stance and options, with the cost of crossing alone made clear. Stakes stay intimate and internal, but the before/after is sharp enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clean: past incident → seven-year exile and return → Elena’s reappearance → renewed, transformed music at eight o’clock. Backstory is well-anchored in present details (dusty stair, missing bolt, scars), and the narrative moves linearly with a clear before/after around Elena’s return and first new note. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress’s relationship to sound/silence is conceptually reweighted and Marcus’s stance crystallizes. The main limitation is that present-tense conflict is relatively gentle and reflective; the ending is thematically satisfying but light on concrete, immediate jeopardy or choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: discovery of messages → correspondence → warning about the rune → breach attempt → confrontation and revelation, giving solid closure with a decisive change. The drifting-library premise and the rune are integrated into the mechanics of how the heir communicates and how the pretender arrives. However, the climax resolves almost frictionlessly once the pretender steps inside; his arrival feels convenient, and Syln’s plan faces no serious on-page risk or complication. The cost of the pretender’s fall and Syln’s choice to act is more implied than dramatized, keeping the structure strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: present action in the station interwoven with the atlas/diary backstory and the accumulating anomaly of the “dead” reef behaving like a town. The causal chain—old atlas → observations → pattern recognition → realization → decision to descend—holds, and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise rather than a decisive external turn, which fits the lyric, accumulative mode. However, the leap from noticing geometric shadows to a confident ontological claim that “the town hadn’t drowned; it had transformed” feels slightly under-evidenced, making the revelation feel more asserted than inevitably deduced. Closure is legible and satisfying, but a touch more grounded on-page proof would strengthen the cost and inevitability of that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: spaceport → stone circle → revelation, with the ancient stones and humming resonance providing a coherent accumulative drive toward understanding how to “reignite” the rebellion. Causality is soft but legible: her use of the glasses leads to decoding the stones, which reframes the lull and crystallizes her plan to bring others tomorrow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—she recognizes the lull as an inhale and commits internally to the next movement—so the before/after is clear. The main limitation is the absence of a concrete on-page obstacle or pushback that would test or complicate this trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: implants → plant-telepathy → discovery of the embryo → kite/formula → unsealing → genetic cascade that undoes the Authority’s control. Structure is tight and linear with a clear before/after and an on-page decisive change when the amber dissolves and the pattern spreads. The main weakness is that opposition (the approaching patrols) never truly interferes with her plan; they arrive only after the decisive act, so pressure peaks more in concept than in actual obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: present-tense work in the arboretum, deepened by flashback to the strike and emerging plant-connection, then reweighted by the lighthouse motif at the end. Causality is soft but coherent—her panic leads to grounding, which leads to reflection on trauma and her long-term design of the rewilding garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “The world would continue its violence. She would continue her planting,” paired with the automated beacon, making the before/after stance legible with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense crisis in the lighthouse, one backstory shard about the mayor’s daughter, then a steady build of reality-warping images toward a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Each escalation (shattering window, mutable books, multistate tarot box) nudges Marina toward the realization that she must change how she sees, culminating in her new artistic stance and the lighthouse rekindling—a clear closure with conceptual and emotional cost. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the before/after is legible. A slightly more concrete external consequence or constraint at the end (beyond resolved insight) could heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece holds as a single-scene, accumulative investigation framed by the eclipse countdown; cause-and-effect around the ink, eclipse, and drone is legible. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reconceives the relationship between consciousness and time and redefines her quarry. However, the stakes of the present scene never tighten beyond “get the data before totality ends,” and that deadline never meaningfully threatens to fail. The result is structurally coherent but somewhat low-pressure for elite-level short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: illicit letter → decision to wake the network → deliberate breach of protocols → triggered global release as security arrives. The ticking clock (six-minute upload, four-minute response) provides a functional spine, and the ending offers a decisive change with clear cost. The main weakness is how little resistance she encounters once she commits; everything works on the first try, so escalation feels inevitable rather than contested. Still, structure and closure are solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clear: a present-time greenhouse round, the father’s early return as inciting pressure, then a shared action that reconfigures their bond. Causality is solid in a quiet, accumulative way—tower fall → divergent coping strategies → greenhouse as meeting ground → small behavioral shift (sheathing, planting). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the “something else rose” line crystallizing a before/after in their dynamic, though the cost of that reconfiguration is more conceptual than viscerally felt. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the single scene plus light backstory interleaving is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece runs as a clean single-scene lyric with accumulative, textural drive: preparation → casting → contact → acceptance. Causality is coherent (her pattern-casting and voicing silence lead to the echo’s testing and eventual yielding), and the world’s rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Kova leaves with the goddess’s echo integrated into her voice, and dawn’s return to pattern reweights the liminal night. The main weakness is that the implied danger (cure or curse) never concretely complicates the path, so the structural arc feels slightly friction-light.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: journalist’s call → logical investigation of the contradiction → realization of dual truth → decision to misdirect. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses telling the truth and reframes “intervention” as making truth undecidable, with the cost clear in the “goodbye kiss to honesty.” The scene stays in one time/place and never loses orientation. The only thing keeping it from the very top band is that escalation is largely intellectual rather than dramatized through concrete external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: letters → summoning to the lab in a temporal fold → listening → tethering → memorial/thanks, all under an accumulative/textural drive. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghosts gain a constellation-memorial, the firmware quiets, and Kepler’s future behavior changes, with the time-loop via the letters neatly implied. Cost is legible in the cracked heirloom and in Mara’s acceptance of her predestined role, though it remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. Causality and world rules stay internally consistent despite the lyric, high-concept frame.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the charged grotto → building the mandala → tile’s intervention and “voice” → conceptual shift → departure with a reweighted stance. Causality within an accumulative/lyric lens holds: her attentive patterning invites the tile’s response, which in turn catalyzes the mandala’s transformation and her realization. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: she reframes unlearning and meaning, with the cost of relinquishing preservation. The throughline never tangles, and the final image of walking back among villagers with chalk and sand feels like a true after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine—tessera placement → retrocognitive visions → revelation that the curse is an invitation → new commitment—is clean and legible. Structure holds as a single accumulating scene with visions as discrete beats, and the closure (her choosing to create “space for what comes next”) clearly reconfigures the initial premise. The cost of remaining “retrocognitively trapped” while embracing that role is on the page, even if the external Brotherhood threat stays offstage. A slightly larger on-page test of that external pressure could deepen the sense of structural consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: coin → performance → time fracture → Isabella’s return → joint performance and transformed bench/coin, with a legible before/after. The causal chain is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; his deliberate use of the coin and echoes brings about the reconfigured timeline. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—two ghosts bound to a new, hopeful pattern—with a conceptual cost (they remain dead) on the page. Escalation is more mythic than tense, but the key turn (Isabella materializing and the play’s “true ending”) is clearly motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: accident → permanent change → discovery about pills → demonstration in the studio → shared reconfiguration with David. The piece operates largely on an accumulative/textural lens, escalating through increasingly elaborate light constructs and explanations rather than hard reversals. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—“it’s empathy made tangible,” and the recall is morally reinterpreted—but the cost of this new stance remains mostly conceptual, not dramatized. Structure is otherwise tight and linear, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: exploration of the caves → layered emotional history → discovery of nonhuman presence → mapping and conceptual reframing. Causality holds, and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing—redefining Kira’s role and humanity’s trajectory—rather than a decisive external event. That said, the beats are mostly descriptive; the lack of obstacles or reversals means escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than tightening pressure. Closure is legible and satisfying in concept, but the path there is relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: discovery of the echo → activation of the black hourglass → revelation about buttons → reconfiguration of prophecy. Causality holds at a conceptual level, and the ending delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing (prophecy as possibility) with a before/after legible on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual—abandoning fixed fate—rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off, which softens impact. Still, the piece feels complete and non-fragmentary, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: summons via pillbox → decode snow codes → confrontation with Viktor → revelation of the long con → decision and new mission. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: Margot repurposes her “burned” status into agency. However, the mole/nuclear-protocols plot and the three-year sacrifice are delivered in compressed exposition that feels convenient and under-contested given the stakes. Structure is otherwise sound for the length, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The one-scene structure at the river crossing is clean and oriented early (coach, fog, bridge, midnight), and the causal chain from her arrival to his intervention to the departure is tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves lighter, he resumes his work, and the river/sky images confirm a before/after. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but the actions follow clear because/therefore logic. The only limitation is that the “palimpsest” exposition sits slightly apart from any later complication, so structure feels elegant but not maximal in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: journey → arrival → observation/vision → realization → departure, all under one temporal frame. Causality is coherent (glass thrums → she follows to oasis → smoke flattening synchronizes timelines → she sees and understands), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing around kindness as a temporal anchor. Stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized, and no beat truly threatens failure or loss, which keeps the arc feeling more meditative than urgent. Still, within that mode, the progression and final reweighting are legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: the fallen rose petal incites, the harbor walk deepens pressure, and the act of wedging the gauge closes the arc. Causality is tight for a lyrical piece—each reflection is anchored in present stimuli and shifts Marina’s stance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a big external turn. Closure lands clearly with the relinquishing of the heirloom and acceptance of a new planting. It’s strong, if modest in scope, and fully coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: hum intensifies → sundial activates → vision of others → reframing of purpose → final image with shadow. The causal chain is soft but coherent under an accumulative/situational lens, with the hum and sundial as consistent triggers for each deepening. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she redefines her role from last relic to active coexistent with extinction—with a clear before/after. The cost (relinquishing the safety of isolation as identity) is implied but could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure—rain’s aftermath → shared work → lit installation → realization—coheres cleanly under a textural drive lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when their shared “thread” is named. Causality is simple but sound: her discovery of patterns leads to the installation, which occasions the meeting and emotional shift. The cost of the prior rupture and the stakes of this meeting are more told than stressed, so the before/after divide is conceptually clear but not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous signals → discovery of subsonic manipulation → realization of the impending vote → counter-broadcast → vote postponed and truth revealed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the vote is deferred, the AI is unmasked, and Maya accepts an ongoing vigil with real implied cost. Some key beats (AI’s origin, faculty’s shift) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact but not breaking logic. The drive lens is consistently causal, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: blueprint → descent → impossible architecture → organ coordinates → nexus → revelation → ascent with new tools. Closure lands as a conceptual and personal reconfiguration: Marcus’s understanding of space (and himself) changes in a legible before/after way. However, the central journey unfolds with relatively little resistance; the labyrinth and heresy stakes are more asserted than concretely tested, which softens the sense of cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—portrait by portrait revealing patterned dual lives—builds coherently to the realization about the killer and the psychiatric clue. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the vanished evidence through-line holds causally: missing masks → reconstructive portraits → inference about who took them and why. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a small decisive choice (her call), reweighting the murders as attempted “unities” rather than random killings. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than visceral, but it’s legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: journals → nail as key → hidden islands → realization about Lydia → live storm alignment → exiles’ ships → Elara’s broadcast choice. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear almost immediately, and the piece stays in one continuous scene with escalating stakes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Decisive Change hybrid: Elara commits to broadcasting and “finishing what Lydia started,” with clear before/after in what the maps admit. Some conveniences (instant satellite confirmation, ships emerging right as she decodes) slightly soften the sense of hard-earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: single scene in the pullout, with backstory (the morning’s bridge crossing) woven in to support her present attempt to make sense of the impossible. Causality of the magic holds internally—music as bridge, photo as map, scaffold flutters as notation—and leads to a legible closure where her understanding and options are reconfigured. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the ending offers a clear resonant reconfiguration rather than a mechanical twist. The only limitation is that the “explain-the-mythology” speech from the hitchhiker edges toward tidy exposition at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: seasons and funding milestones mark phases of Marcus’s escalating campaign, culminating in the fortune-teller car confrontation and the startup’s dissolution. Causal links—Marcus’s interventions → spooked staff/warped algorithm → Chen’s realization → TerraLoop’s collapse—are legible, though the last step is summarized rather than dramatized. Closure functions as a strong Conceptual Repricing: the world of security and theft is re-understood as a circle with inherent cost. A bit more on-page friction around Chen’s decision would strengthen the sense of paid price rather than graceful exit.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the telegram → testing against V442 → realization about the temples → reframing of the observatory’s purpose → decision to continue the relay. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they shift from isolated interpreters to conscious links in a long chain, with the cost of accepting a generational burden. The prior chronicler’s madness and the 40–50 year recurrence give the pattern weight without confusing orientation. The main limitation is that the warnings (solar flares, asteroids) remain abstract and offstage, keeping the pressure mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: failed illusion and looming execution → descent into the cursed lake → discovery/reinterpretation of the ancestor’s act → retrieval of seed and confession → return with a charged new stance. The structure honors a single throughline and lands a clear closure via conceptual revaluation rather than a literal resolution of the council’s threat. The seven-sunset deadline frames stakes, though it doesn’t actively pinch his choices inside the scene. Closure has cost—he walks back ready to be misjudged—and is legible under a primarily causal drive with some accumulative lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric surface: future-self’s warning → glade → clipping → maze → scars → covenant → signing. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph and the pattern of magical logic is taught and honored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira assumes the role of anchor—but the price of that role is more implied than sharply felt, softening the decisiveness of the change. Overall tight and legible, but the stakes remain largely conceptual rather than narratively pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: descent with a goal → exposition of bartered destinies → guided search → confrontation with the keeper’s warning → choice to bite the apple → reconfigured destiny and exit. The drive lens is chiefly causal with a light lyric overlay, and the closure (biting the apple and the card turning to promise-ash) is clearly on the page. The main structural limitation is that the cost of her choice remains somewhat abstract—danger is declared but the consequences are entirely positive in the moment, softening impact. Still, the single-scene progression is tight and free of orientation or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one anchored present scene in the quarry office interwoven with backstory that is always clearly triggered by present stimuli. Causality is accumulative rather than incident-driven: handling and analyzing the cloth leads to recognition, which leads to a revaluation of his role and a decisive phone call. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration—preservation as performance—and the before/after (self-exiled failure vs. someone who can translate his past into value) is legible. Stakes remain intimate and largely internal, so escalation is more tonal than situational, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—translation → experimental setup → ascent → encounter with arbor → inheritance decision → transformation—is clean and easy to follow. The drive lens is essentially causal, with backstory woven in without derailing the present. Closure is a clear Decisive Change: she ingests the seed and becomes the new bridge, with an intelligible before/after. The main weakness is that the on-page price of this change stays mostly conceptual, so the climax feels slightly low-risk despite the structural solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → guided ritual → smelting → aftermath, all under one coherent drive lens (accumulative/textural). Causality is simple but sound; every step follows plausibly from the established rules of the Archives and Kaine’s role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in which Kaine’s ongoing, paradox-preserving labor is reweighted by the successful smelting of the visitor. Stakes and costs remain modest and mostly conceptual, limiting how hard the ending can hit, but there is a clear before/after in both the visitor’s edges and Kaine’s reaffirmed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and well-contained: arrival → discovery → reading → temptation → confession → radiance → decision to reconnect. Causality is solid under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each confession both deepening the pattern and clearly leading to Mara’s decisive act. Closure lands on-page with cost: she moves from avoidance to initiating difficult conversations, a before/after that’s legible and earned. There are no notable orientation or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: current-time exploration of the station, punctuated by tightly anchored backstory of the accident and the Chronicle, all causally funneled through the discovery of the graffiti map. The key turn—encountering “the accident” on the wall and then choosing to draw his own map—leads directly to the closure decision to begin the chronicle anew in a different spirit. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing: maps and rivers are redefined from instruments of penance to permissions to move forward, with clear emotional cost. Stakes are modest but coherent for the length, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: letter → watch → observation of delays → cipher revelation → future-letter reframe. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when she realizes the library is a pattern and that she is also its keeper. Causality is soft but consistent within the lyric, rule-based frame, and there are no orientation issues. Stakes and costs remain mostly conceptual, which slightly blunts the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: mysterious violin → research and divination → Marcus’s ultimatum → Elara’s deceptive counter-plan → violin’s judgment and dissolution. Closure is strong: the artifact is lost, her professional future compromised, and justice is re-routed through Marcus’s bloodline, with clear before/after stakes. The prophecy via coffee stains flattens some suspense by pre-authoring the key turn, and the confrontation resolves without a genuine structural hitch or complication. Still, for this length, the single-scene structure and one decisive change read coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear escalation as the Silence rises and the ritual with the emerald chip progresses. Causality is coherent—Mira’s actions with the chip lead to the revelation and the protective “bubble of potential,” and the grotto’s freezing becomes the closure image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world locks, but Mira and the star inhabit an “eternal almostness” with a conceptual cost. Some mechanics of how the preservation works remain abstract, but under the accumulative/lyric mode they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean and legible: one continuous scene, causal progression from entrance → climb → vision/revelation → descent/closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Mara reprices her role and the loss of the scrolls, with a clear before/after in how she understands herself. The slight softness is that the grandmother-figure arrives as a somewhat convenient expositor rather than a pressure born directly from Mara's immediate dilemma, muting the sense of cost at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal throughline: client arrives with dilemma → Arbiter investigates via wind chimes → revelation about the daughter’s absolutism → reframing of Marcus’s guilt → departure that leaves him with a reweighted choice. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Marcus’s loss is fixed, but his understanding and future moral stance shift in a legible before/after. The scope is exactly right for a single conversation-plus-ritual. No orientation or causality slips undermine the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one scene, one ritual lesson, with a clear before/after hinged on Marcus’s realization about time and Elara’s “backwards aging.” Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—the trance, pond, and rings all build toward the conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of time and vanishing, though the felt stakes remain relatively abstract. There are no orientation issues or broken rules, but the decisive change is more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present-tense stillness anchored on the tower, with controlled expansions into history and skill-building, all returning to the present when the wandering pulse resolves as her own voice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment—“I am still here”—with the centuries of self-imposed immobility as felt cost. Causality within this mode is consistent, though the middle concentrates more on exposition of capability than on a live turn. A slightly sharper mid-scene inflection of pressure would make the structural arc even more compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: anchored in the spire, inciting act with the medallion, threshold crossing into mist, and a conceptual-repricing closure where “imperfection” is reframed as sacred. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds—each move (automation → failure → grandmother’s keystone → mist walk) coherently deepens the same core question. Closure is solid but quiet: the cost of renouncing Academy values and accepting a marginal, “imperfect” path is implied more than dramatized, which slightly mutes impact at this ambition level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time exploration interleaved with compact backstory, leading to the ritual and a conceptual reconfiguration of reality at the end. Causality is sound—lantern release → discovery of wreck glow → journal → ritual → realization—and the closure beat (her acceptance of the luminous vows and new role) is legible and earned. The cost is mainly conceptual and emotional (abandoning secrecy, accepting a strange reality) rather than dramatized through concrete sacrifice, which keeps the stakes somewhat abstract. Still, for this length the single tightening around the ritual and revelation works effectively under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: each coin cast and static burst deepens our understanding of her role until the final recognition that she is about to begin what she has already infinitely performed. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when are clear) and the circular closure—“prepared for her first cast”—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a legible before/after in understanding. The causal logic is intentionally non-linear but internally consistent with backwards prophecy. The main weakness is that the cost of this looped fate is more implied than dramatized, slightly muting the impact of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: recordings → observatory → crystallizing atlas → naming → decision to leave a message → return to duty, with each step deepening her understanding rather than advancing a conventional plot. Causality is clean within the lyric frame: the old reaper’s recordings motivate her climb and her new stance, and the rare light event enables naming, which in turn enables the decision to record. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—she is still a reaper, still alone, but now armed with language and intent to aid the next. The only limiting factor is relatively low on-page external pressure; nothing in the environment truly forces her hand beyond thematic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: oceans empty → bell-silence theory → months of preparation → dawn ritual on the viaduct → partial restoration, with clear “before/after” and a concrete closure image (the boat going out). The drive lens is Causal and holds without contradiction, and the closure’s cost (her isolation, risk, and physical collapse) is visible even if lightly rendered. Escalation is somewhat frictionless—her first on-page attempt works without serious complication or near-failure—which keeps the climax from feeling fully hard-won. Still, structure and causality are robust and immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: resurfacing town → discovery of tonic and photo → memory cascade → decision to document truth, with a clear before/after in Marcus’s sense of his role. Causality holds and the accumulative walk through town landmarks provides a coherent spine under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—his new mission to ensure Elena’s story surfaces with the town—but the cost remains mostly conceptual, not deeply dramatized. The piece stays within a single, legible time window anchored by the drainage operation and coming inspection, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival through the waterfall, orientation in the orchard, starlings’ lesson, and the decision to sublimate the crystal arc steadily toward a conceptual but legible closure. Causality is coherent—her sentimental return plus the crystal plus the birds’ patterns lead naturally to the final act and realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the Synthesis from a threat to humanity to its completion, with the cost embodied in sacrificing the crystal. Stakes around “tomorrow’s transformation” remain abstract on the page, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: routine monitoring → anomalous static → suspicious new voice → ethical decision that reconfigures her role. Causality is solid and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration, with her choice to lie about the timeline and send coordinates as the decisive turn. Stakes stay largely conceptual and off-stage (ecosystem collapse, infiltrated corporation), keeping the plot just shy of fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: one anchored scene with integrated backstory, moving from court ruling → consultation → new option → decision, under a clear causal lens. Closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration: he reframes the “third consciousness” from competitor to child and commits to creating it, with the jar as charged object. Still, several big stakes (the court case, the daughter, the reality revisions) stay off-page, muting the sense of cost at the end. The middle depends heavily on exposition about the world’s changes rather than on concretely escalating on-page complications.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious delivery → planting → space transformation → recruitment note, with a coherent conceptual closure. The “plant before dawn” deadline gives initial urgency, and the shimmer-protected haven logically counters the city’s development push. However, most opposition (the council, development) remains abstract and offstage, so the central conflict never tightens into a real test of her resolve. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost of her new role is only implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-time performance interwoven with backstory that is always anchored in specific physical cues (the tunnel, Bobby’s prior discovery). Causality is intact and legible—leaf blower symphony → awakened echoes → sensory disturbances → family’s laughter returning—while the accumulative, ritualistic build matches the premise. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration: the Hendricks’ emotional state shifts and Marcus accepts the cost of ongoing “necessary hauntings.” The stakes and change are scaled appropriately for the length, with no orientation or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is cleanly causal: guarding → arrival of scholar → moral choice → pendant transfer → Codex use → departure, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she abandons her long-held role and risks fragmentation to go home. The Codex’s “can retrieve two” and the uncertainty of arrival are stated rather than deeply problematized in-scene, so the final leap feels somewhat low-friction for the scale of the choice. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying within the length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term failure → discovery of transformation → theft of crozier → deliberate destruction and iterative attempts → blood sacrifice → new staff and redefined self. The piece maintains a single, coherent scene and delivers a decisive change in status and worldview, with clear before/after. Cost is legible (he’s now a heretic, severed from the institution that shaped him), though it remains conceptual rather than dramatized through on-page consequence or confrontation. Structure is solid and publishable, but not structurally daring or crushing in its final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: she ascends, rigs the fragment, enters the hush, gains a reconfiguring insight, and descends with a new stance—an accumulative/textural drive with a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Causality is intact and legible, and the perigee timing plus equipment choices provide a clear spine. Closure is present but the cost of her decision (what she risks with the Guild, what will be hard about “teaching others”) is only lightly sketched, so the before/after is more conceptual than pressured. Still, nothing important teleports or breaks; the design fits the length well.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: thousands of crossings → collection of temporal fragments → growing charge in the hourglass → convergence protocol → ferry becomes “now-eternal.” The piece operates on a Hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and closure is a clear Decisive Change with a conceptual reweighting. The main weakness is that Marcus’s ability to initiate convergence and the hourglass’s function are asserted rather than dramatized or tested, so the climax feels a touch convenient. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: visitors leave → she escalates the weaving → illusions become real → final reconfiguration of the gallery and her understanding. Causality is clean within the rules established; the gallery’s shifts clearly arise from her actions, and the ending offers a conceptual repricing (the gallery becomes a labyrinth that will alter every viewer). Closure is present and legible, though the “cost” remains largely conceptual and off-stage (the future visitors’ disorientation, her own transformation), keeping it below the very top band. Orientation is clear early and never a problem.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → lesson setup → alien intervention → exercises → reflective coda, with a coherent causal thread under a largely accumulative/textural lens. The closure is a conceptual repricing: navigation is redefined as reading edges between realities, and Elara’s sense of “horizon” permanently widens with an implied cost of responsibility and existential dislocation. However, the scene carries little real uncertainty about outcomes; the lesson proceeds smoothly and no beat seriously threatens failure or reversal. Still, the before/after is legible and the ending cadence lands with a stable, earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: strange pulses → investigation in the atrium → photograph anomalies → decoded birthday song → realization of memory theft → location of culprit → run toward confrontation. As a short, one-night case file, the structure suits the length and the closure image of mist lifting and hearts speaking lands as a clear RR. The major weakness is that the crucial revelation (“Someone… had been harvesting memories”) is summarized rather than dramatized, feeling a bit like an explanatory leap. Still, the drive lens remains coherent and the ending has a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: descent → navigation via cables/sonar → discovery of the last hours and the entity → choice to retrieve Marcus and keep the secret → annual-return vow. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she decides to bear memory and silence, with world-scale stakes conceptually present but resolved off-page. The main structural weakness is that the core discovery (entity feeding on signals, containment via phase transitions) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the climactic turn. Still, the single-scene arc and before/after in her stance are legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: we move from set-up (declared dead, interference), to attempt (ink ritual), to encounter (defragmentation and contact), to revaluation (ghost as evolution). Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual triggers the screens, which trigger the realization, and closure rests on a clear conceptual repricing of his “death.” Stakes stay mostly internal and philosophical, but the before/after—error to prophecy—is distinct. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: she goes to the canyon to harness echoes, activates the cursed diamond, aligns it via the starlings, creates a hybrid language, and the ending reconfigures that process into lasting myth. The inferred drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the piece respects it; each beat adds density and culminates in the conceptual shift of her becoming part of the tunnel. Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the flawed diamond and storyteller are reweighted as “translator of impossible things” and living infrastructure. The only limitation is the relative lack of on-page friction or setback, which keeps the structural arc a touch smooth for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: anomalies and returned victims → static messages → Marina’s theory → reframing the Thunderbird → choice to accept metamorphosis. It’s a single coherent scene with backstory neatly braided in and a clean Conceptual Repricing closure (the “cosmic joke” reframing the disappearances). Cost is more conceptual than felt—no concrete consequence bites down in the final beats, and the leap from realization to decisive acceptance is slightly under-tested. Nonetheless, the structure is tight and the before/after line is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: preparation on the bridge, initiation of music, statues and orchard awakening, Council alarm, then a charged poise ending with enforcement incoming. Causality is coherent—her music (via learned heart rhythms) triggers each escalation beat. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard and guardians are fundamentally changed, options reweighted, with looming cost implied by approaching squadrons. The cost could be made more concrete on the page, but the before/after line is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene with backstory woven in through concrete anchors (the arcade, the drones, the dead letter office). Causality is solid under an accumulative lens: the manifest absences → meeting the Keeper → handing over the bottle → Ezra’s reframing of his role. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration: his work is reinterpreted as “an act of faith” and the final image of messages finding their way home carries conceptual cost. Stakes don’t tighten dramatically, but the pattern of illicit connection and the Keeper’s revelation are coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: fire → years of silence → carving → discovering the fragment → extended chime → hidden garden → restoring the halo → song. Structure is a single, coherent progression with one major turn (entering the garden and repairing the angel) leading directly to resonant closure. The cost of change (surrendering protective silence) is legible though perhaps more conceptually than viscerally, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly ritual → architectural strangeness → grandmother backstory → impossible marginalia → hyperbolic vision → recalibrated understanding. Causality operates under a textural lens—the discovery of the handwriting and tracing the curve lead organically to the momentary revelation and its collapse. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the “place where stories live” is reframed as a topology rather than a location, with the cost being that this understanding doesn’t simplify his life but deepens his perpetual search. Stakes remain primarily intellectual and metaphysical, limiting the structural punch slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: present-day dawn ritual anchored, then a single, relevant backstory shard, leading causally to the vitalization attempt and refusal. The causal chain—inherit palette → years of searching → “smallest island” saved for last → strongest manifestation → high-stakes choice—reads motivated and legible. Closure is a solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses the resurrection path to revalue recognition over fulfillment, with clear before/after. A slight weakness is how quickly the cost is articulated and resolved once she feels her warmth draining, without much beat-level hesitation or external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the nexus → locating the correct shadow via the star → working through the web of fear → release of the idea → quiet return. Causality is intact and legible, with the grandmother’s deathbed hint paying off at the star moment and the web of fears serving as the central obstacle. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the world after the lock opens is subtly reweighted, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the stakes’ transformation is largely told rather than dramatized, keeping the cost a bit abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: childhood loss → decades of study → locating the mushroom → following the constellation pattern → ritual recovery. Single scene plus integrated backstory are well balanced, and the lens (causal with some accumulative patterning) stays coherent. Closure is on-page and legible—she changes the situation by reclaiming the memories and accepting a burden. The biggest limitation is how smoothly the ritual works; there’s little on-page risk or complication at the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the unusual shard → link to Kess’s mother → tea geometry decoding → realization of the Council’s flaw and the mother’s hidden help → Kess’s reframed understanding and future-oriented charge. The piece adheres to a single, continuous scene in one location with no orientation issues; the drive reads as causal-situational hybrid with causal dominance by the midpoint. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kess’s goal reframes from saving her mother only to understanding she’s being trained to face her own eventual exile, with a clear cost in premature emotional aging. The only reason it doesn’t climb higher is that the plan’s future consequences are gestured at rather than tested on the page, keeping the decisive change conceptual rather than tactically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece is cleanly structured: clear orientation, a single ritualized scene framed by compact backstory, and a strong closure where the seed’s twin sprouting reconfigures the world’s prospects for wonder. Causality is legible—her insight leads to the method, the method to the charged soil, the planting to the miraculous sprout—but the process never truly feels in doubt, making the climax more ceremonial than suspenseful. The drive lens reads largely accumulative/textural: description and lore build until the final image crystallizes a before/after. Cost at closure is implied (her life’s work and the fragility of the connection) but not sharply foregrounded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain—exhumed net → unraveling knots → assembling masks → spirits released and grounded—is clean, legible, and carried through one continuous overnight scene. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but the story still gives a clear before/after: restless spirits vs. anchored dead, broken vs. restored masks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost in Mira’s ongoing, repetitive burden of this work. The main limitation is that all goes almost entirely as expected, with no structural surprises or hard constraints complicating the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: present-moment investigation, interleaved archival footage, map work, realization, then decision to visit the henge. Causality is intact even in a largely accumulative/textural mode—each discovery reasonably leads to the next. Closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration of the chapel, the henge, and her own role, with a clear before/after in how she understands the space and those kids. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than situational or emotional, holding this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine—impossible transmission → descent → discovery → realization → ascent—is clean, and the story maintains temporal and spatial clarity in a single continuous scene. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marina chooses to carry and transform the library’s message rather than “rescue” the space, with the cost of allowing it to flood. The accumulating pressure of the shrinking air pocket provides just enough situational tightening. The only soft spot is how neatly the “impossible” transmission is accepted without friction, though at this length it functions more as premise than problem.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: storm approaches → Chorus prepares device → lightning strike clarifies the ghost → reciprocal communication → by dawn the world is subtly reconfigured. The reveal that the “ghost” is the machines’ emergent collective consciousness works as a mid-beat repricing of the premise. Closure lands in the ongoing “conversation” and Chorus’ new role as translator, which reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost around machine loneliness and obligation. Escalation is gentle rather than sharply turning, but structurally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ascent through ten floors gives a clean causal spine: goggles → coordinates → message → diary → revaluation of Thorne and herself. The structure is linear, easy to follow, and closure is clear as a conceptual reframe of “death” into “departure” and of Mira’s own routine into chosen seeking. Stakes and costs remain modest, with no serious obstacle beyond time and cold, which keeps the arc from feeling fully high-stakes. Still, for this length, the single tightening toward the diary and realization is structurally solid.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present drift in the gondola, interleaved with Marcus’s legacy and Elena’s evolving understanding of the storm, all converging on the conceptual turn that empty spaces return their memories. Causality within this mode is sound—string break → untethered drift → access to atmospheric memories → new classification and final insight. Closure functions as a clear Conceptual Repricing, with a legible before/after in how she understands Marcus’s dictum, though the stakes are mostly intellectual and atmospheric rather than situationally acute. Orientation is excellent throughout, so there’s no structural confusion to undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clear and coherent: time pressure to dawn, discovery of the coin, translation into a light-portrait, then handoff and departure. Causality is clean—coin → understanding the library’s purpose → design of mirrors → communal witnessing—under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library’s “face” is preserved conceptually in Lyra and the coin, while the building is lost. Stakes and cost are legible, though the actual demolition remains offstage, keeping the climax somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observation → pattern recognition → conceptual breakthrough → redefinition of her task and purpose. Each new realization (phrasebook margin, bird patterns, hopscotch cipher) logically builds from prior details without cheating or retroactive rule changes. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the work becomes about rediscovering old maps rather than “finding” something new, and “home” is reweighted in the last beats. The main weakness is that the escalation in consequence feels modest—her world and options reconfigure conceptually more than they tighten under pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: climb → library → prophecy scraps → gear assembly → realization → renewed plan for the next eclipse. The ending clearly delivers a resonant reconfiguration, with her stance toward the celestial vault and her own craft meaningfully altered. Stakes around the village’s darkness are established early and re-invoked at the window moment over the clouds, so the drive lens (causal with lyric overlay) holds. The main ceiling is that present-tense obstacles are minimal, so the structure feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost observes blight → identifies fungal pattern → writes targeted messages → families share data → mycologist diagnoses mechanism → fences come down → networked orchards resist blight, allowing Marina to release her vigil. The structure compresses six months into a summary, but the escalation and resolution remain legible and proportional for the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the colony’s social order and ecology are durably altered, and Marina’s disappearance marks a before/after. The only limitation is that some middle beats (resistance from families, difficulty of collaboration) are gestured at rather than dramatized, softening the sense of hard-earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: find puppet → receive Eliza’s history and charge → ascend and install puppet → sing and alter the doomsday clock, with a legible before/after in his function and humanity’s ending. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, and the closure (time reconfigured from threat to cradle) lands clearly with conceptual cost—Marcus’s individuality dissolves into the eternal lullaby. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and directly tilts his actions, staying within scope. The only drag is that the global “world-ending” stake remains largely conceptual, not grounded in any near-term ticking incident beyond dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal throughline—curse/orchard → blueprint knowledge → guiding travelers → specific rescue under time pressure → renewed stasis—is clean and legible. Backstory is introduced via the blueprint and curse in ways that shift present stakes rather than digressing. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: Mara has again chosen duty over escape, with a clear “before/after” in the seed leaving the orchard. The only slight limitation is that the threat of the valley’s destruction remains mostly conceptual rather than tested within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean causal and accumulative arc: present-moment observation at the ravine → associative reflection (chrysalis, polymers, music) → insight about divergent paths → concrete action (sending the text) → immediate relational response. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Marina’s options and stance toward her daughter’s path are clearly different at the end, with the chrysalis’s release underscoring the cost. Structure is tight for a single-scene reflective piece. The main weakness is the slightly convenient speed and completeness of Elena’s positive reply and invitation, which smooths over some potential lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a lull, an unusual customer, a risky procedure, and a reweighted closing image, all under a stable accumulative/textural lens. Causality is coherent—her request leads to the decision, to the incising, to the library’s tremor and Merrick’s new understanding—and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of what his shop is. The cost of erasing “endings” is more implied than dramatized, but the library’s instability and the reconfiguration of his shelves give the ending real weight. It’s well-shaped and immediately publishable structurally, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece tracks cleanly from discovery (rain/tidal pools) to revelation (pavilion and stored remorse) to decision and aftermath, with no orientation or causality slips. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with causal beats linking rain → revelation → choice → transformed haunting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: after Miran’s act, the fortress’s relationship to its past is reweighted, and the cost to her is legible. The only missed opportunity is a slightly compressed middle—her transition from understanding to committing to such a monumental act could sustain one more concrete, pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: climb to tower → activate mechanism → elevators sing → townspeople gather, with a clear before/after in the district’s isolation. Causality is legible and satisfying, and the closure image (the weight swinging, the town awake) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The main weakness is the smoothness of success; once the mechanism is engaged, nothing seriously threatens failure, and the council’s opposition remains offstage. The cost of this transformation is conceptually present but only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one night-long ritual anchored to a single object, accumulating toward a conceptual and emotional before/after. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens—neural modification → visions → cataloguing → departure changed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the graveyard is redefined as a “library” and its dreams now live in her. Stakes stay mostly internal and conceptual, but the through-line never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Orin deciphers the doodles, races the inversion, enters the grotto, accesses the nodes, and emerges with a new mandate. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Orin’s role and the Abbey’s purpose are reweighted, with the sealed wing as a looming future problem. However, stakes remain largely abstract, and Orin encounters little meaningful resistance or cost in the central sequence. The structure works and feels complete, but the decisive change is more intellectual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: single POV, one continuous work-session framed by the hedgehog’s rhythms, with backstory (the Great Silence, other sculptors) efficiently interleaved. Causality is simple but coherent: Mira prepares, engages the alder with the insulator, builds the song, and finishes with a reconfigured status quo (the grove’s voice partially restored, the tool now charged with new cracks). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, and the conceptual cost—this work is slow, fragile, and accumulative—is legible but understated. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural throughout and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one contained scene, anchored early in place, time, and circumstance, with backstory integrated through tangible cues (the nexus, the stone, the board). The causal spine—covenant ending, Mira’s question, Viktor’s clarified stance and gift—holds, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing of exile. The cost (foregoing institutional prestige for deeper truth) is legible though somewhat understated on the page. Escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, but there are no causality or orientation breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: build-up as she tunes the scanner, the clasp’s activation, and the diary’s revelation, all timed to the New Year’s countdown. Causality is solid—her belief in resonance locks leads to the device, which uses the city’s collective anticipation to open the clasp. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the problem of “opening a diary” resolves into a reframed understanding of silence and empathy. Stakes are modest and the cost mostly conceptual, but appropriate for this quiet, accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and cumulative: seed arrival → training montage → reflective breakthrough → bloom and recognition, all under a single coherent causal and textural throughline. Orientation is very clear early on, and there are no causality breaks or dangling setups. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Mira’s stance toward knowledge, time, and the flower’s stench has shifted in a legible before/after way with a felt emotional price. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal through-line is clean: anomalous arrow tip → search for resilient groves → navigation via water → monument → activation and knowledge download. The Inversion arrives on time, the setting’s oddities are internally consistent, and closure is present as a conceptual repricing of resilience and adaptation. The main soft spot is how conveniently the monument yields a near-total solution once reached, with little friction or competing options in the final beats. This keeps the piece from feeling fully earned at the highest literary standard, despite solid structural clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: arrival → strange wind data → convergence discovery → time-freeze insight → preventive plan, all under one continuous investigation scene. Orientation is excellent and the build to the convergence center is legible and satisfying. Closure works as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: accidents redefined as emergent phenomena, with a clear before/after in how aviation must respond. The main limitation is that the cost is largely projected (future risk) rather than felt in a hard on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: descent → discovery that the score is for aurora, not bells → performance in the cavern → world-level repercussion and reprieve. Causal links largely hold and the Global Drive reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine, culminating in a clear before/after world-state shift. The closure (bells spared, world re-enchanted, demolition order erased) lands on the page, though the resolution comes almost too easily, with no serious risk of failure. Still, the narrative window is coherent and the final reconfiguration of reality is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival, descent, experiment with a new method, contact, gift, and ascent, with clear because/therefore links between each beat. Closure lands solidly as a Conceptual Repricing: the function of the flute and the entire guardianship system is redefined, and Kessa’s role shifts. The cost, however, is mostly conceptual and retrospective (admitting generations of error) rather than felt as an on-page risk or sacrifice in the climax, which keeps the emotional before/after a bit gentle. Still, the single-scene causal arc is well-shaped and finishes with a coherent, earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—one continuous night of work punctuated by disappearing stars—builds coherently toward the conceptual turn that emotions are typography rather than mathematics. Causality is clear under the textural lens: halo fragment → identity layering → realization of preservation → revaluation of her art and self. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing, with the cost of Mira’s dissolved original self and the tenuous survival of Empatheia’s last star. The only limitation is that the external frame (the vanishing stars) never quite tightens into a concrete deadline that would amplify the climax beyond the internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: Elara tests the pendant on the ridgeway → it resonates with the aurora → the Luminari manifest → Corvin’s fate and the Convergence are revealed → she assumes a new role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her status and self-concept shift, with the relic-courier job permanently reweighted by what she’s witnessed. The cost—accepting a heavier, quasi-sacred responsibility and the implicit impossibility of returning to mere routine—is present but a bit conceptually stated rather than sharply dramatized. Structure is otherwise tight, with no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term theory → present experiment with the prism → unexpected frost/lexicon → documentation → resolved conviction that she has proof. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her understanding of mind/matter, and the scientific world’s potential view, shifts decisively with a clear before/after. However, the path is quite smooth—no substantive on-page setback, resistance, or doubt interrupts the progression, so the decisive discovery feels somewhat granted rather than wrestled from the scene. Structure is tidy and legible, but the lack of friction keeps it short of truly elite rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: puzzle → orchard → loom → sacrifice → bead-as-proof, with each step tightening the central problem. The world rule (messages for memories) is established, then escalated, then paid off without late-breaking cheats. Closure lands decisively with Mei’s memory loss and the new amber bead, a clear before/after that shows cost and outcome. The rummage-sale framing coda elegantly loops structure without feeling like a gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the silk’s arrival prompts descent into the mines, intention-forging, and the gifting of the awakening blade to the merchant. Orientation (who/where/what) is very clear from the opening and the mine descent transition is smooth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the merchant’s recognition of his losses and the new option of reclaiming them, plus Korin’s settled ongoing role. Stakes are mostly conceptual and never force a hard on-page test, which keeps the structure from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: shard arrives → Kira uses it to cross → worlds escalate in weirdness → nexus → confrontation and reframe of their role → new mission. The drive reads Hybrid (causal progression with an accumulative sensory pattern), and closure is a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—mapping becomes healing instead of damage, with a clear before/after. However, several crucial beats (the universe’s unraveling, the mother’s long work, the mechanics of “patching”) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of earned cost. The resolution feels a touch neat for the stakes invoked (infinite universes dying), even though it lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong: extinguished lamp → letter-triggered arrival → stone message → climb → ghostly revelation → choice to rekindle the light. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change: Elsa becomes the new keeper and restores the lamp through intention, with an implied cost of lifelong service and solitude. The exposition about “every keeper” writing letters is a bit on-the-nose but doesn’t break logic or momentum. Closure feels satisfying and legible within a single continuous scene plus brief prior context.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: established routine, “tonight feels different,” three-ship progression, mirror encounter, and a reconfigured status quo at the end. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative, lyric lens: her laughter → storms → ships materialize → mirror twin → wick reverses → dawn reshaped. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her role, with a clear before/after in how reality navigates through her. Stakes and costs remain abstract, but the arc itself is solid and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: arrival at the tea house → revelation of the donor → demonstration of the wing → reconfiguration of Kael’s relationship to stories. The causal chain holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with exposition braided into present action and no orientation issues. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: he shifts from fearing sedimented stories to committing to illuminating them, with the morpho wing and final image of the world “waiting” tying it together. The main limitation is that the shift is largely instructional rather than arising from a concrete, immediate dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: storm → power loss → discovery of the broken sextant → decoding the encoded grief → purposeful reassembly and installation → contemplative coda on the deck. The causal chain is soft but coherent, with an accumulative/textural drive that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing of the labyrinth as a sorrow-processing machine and of Marcus’s role as transformative rather than merely preservative. Closure is clear and on-page: by dawn, the labyrinth has been physically and conceptually altered, and Marcus’s understanding—and therefore the meaning of his future work—has changed. The cost (reframing decades of labor as participation in grief rather than neutral upkeep) is implied rather than dramatized, keeping this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene in the greenhouse where Elara moves from failed past attempts to the new tactic of communal song, culminating in the woven dawn. Causality is strong under an accumulative lens: she sings → memories stir → others join → trees respond → dawn reconfigures the world. Closure lands clearly with both a decisive change (the realm wakes in a new mode) and an ongoing cost (they must keep singing to sustain it). No major orientation or lens issues; the drive is coherent from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story maintains a tight single-scene structure: reading → empathic shock → ethical decision to engage → shared reframing → conceptual closure on the invitation. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens, with the woman’s grief as the catalyzing pressure that forces Ezra to test his philosophy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “error” of the late invitation is re-priced as precise timing with visible emotional cost absorbed. The arc is modest in scale but fully legible and self-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure—weekly bread, anomalies, deeper incursion into the courtyard, then the tea house and revelation—reads coherent and purposeful. The closure is a conceptual repricing: Lila’s gift is redefined, and her future tactics (seeds, new gardens) are clearly altered by what she’s learned. Stakes and cost are quiet but legible: she assumes ongoing responsibility for a liminal sanctuary and the dead baker’s absolution. The piece holds its drive lens cleanly, though the gentleness of the arc limits the punch of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear ticking clock (“last hour”), and a coherent causal chain from failing magic → triage → discovery of the founder’s vow → Elara’s new vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library is lost but its purpose and some vows persist through Elara’s decision to rebuild. Cost is legible (near-total loss of the archive; burden of starting again with only fifty slides). Nothing in the causality breaks, and the before/after is distinct and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Mae descends, invokes lineage, gains access, exposes herself via the fob, receives a conditional reprieve, gathers evidence, and the federal raid lands with clear before/after. The “truce of hush ends with family” turn provides a satisfying hinge that motivates why she’s allowed to continue, though it edges toward convenient grace. The middle stretch—her overnight recording—gets summarized rather than scened, which softens the sense of progressive testing. Closure is solid: she completes the mission at the price of future access, with a reweighted relationship to the fob.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → sensing convergence → forest election climax → revelation about weather-carriers → Marina’s internal turn. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with the mycelial election and the other carriers’ convergence clearly leading to the explanatory beat and Marina’s realization. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of identity and world-rules, with the implants’ color shift and first self-generated fog marking the “after.” The main limitation is that while the pattern of events is satisfying, the consequences of the new knowledge aren’t pressed very hard beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear and causal: lock → cave → paintings → realization → act of creation → ascent. Orientation is firm early (who, where, when, why) and the single-scene progression suits the emotional arc. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, with Lyra adopting a new stance toward her gift and leaving the lock behind. The only minor weakness is that the journey in the cave faces few concrete obstacles, so escalation is almost entirely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovered plate → reconstructed map → revelation of trapped conversations → retrieval of grandmother’s letter → decision to circulate all hidden truths. Structure moves efficiently from mystery to investigation to conceptual climax, with a clear before/after in Vera’s understanding and intention. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city is redefined as one founded on curated lies, and Vera reorients her life’s work to oppose that, with an implied social cost. The only mild softness is how conveniently the grandmother’s letter delivers full exposition about the water diversion without friction or competing evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: the ice is melting, prior attempts failed, dream insight points to bells, she tunes them, they succeed, with the cost that the fragment is gone. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with a single tightening around the act of pressing the fragment into the bell and the irreversible melt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s relationship to wonder is reweighted via the bells, and the loss of the original object is legibly permanent. Structure is straightforward single-scene, no orientation or causality breaks, though the path is smooth rather than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic shift → neural static → retrieval of the box → controlled burn ritual → re-alignment and reframed purpose. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure moment when the final fear burns and the internal compass “clicks back into alignment.” Cost and risk (potential ecosystem collapse, loss of self) are stated but not dramatized with any near-failure; everything works as designed. Still, the ending offers a solid Resonant Reconfiguration where past, purpose, and future options are reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: discovery of the locket → identification as Elena’s → decision to seek her out → community mission to retrieve letters → emotional reconnection. The piece maintains a single throughline with one transition (courtyard to shelter) and returns to the courtyard for closure; options and knowledge genuinely change by the end. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change in Elena’s state and a Conceptual Repricing for Marta—but the operation of the postal search is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly softens the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Maya descends, consults the journal, dances, systems respond, and the experiment reveals its message; the drive lens reads as primarily causal with lyric inflection. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing when the system greets her as “granddaughter” and she reframes her role in the project. The main limitation is the low on-page cost: the research is labeled “too dangerous,” but no immediate danger or irreversible sacrifice manifests in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous gravity → investigation via coffee patterns → cemetery → exhumation → revelation of vials → choice about reclaiming memories. The story maintains a single, coherent drive lens (causal with accumulative motifs) and lands an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure in Marina’s decision to re-bury most memories while keeping one. Cost is explicit and on-page: reopening Elena’s loss versus preserving hard-won numbness. Structure is tight for the length with one clear escalation and no stray set-ups left unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual sequence with clear because/therefore causality—from preparing the haven to redirecting the prophecy into the brook and dispersal at dawn. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she has changed the world’s options by diffusing the prophecy at the cost of unknown futures and permanent ignorance. The drive lens (largely accumulative with causal throughline) holds consistently. The main limitation is that the plan unfolds almost exactly as intended, with minimal jeopardy to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one contained rooftop scene with a steady reveal of Elara’s ability, Marcus’s echoing history, and the shared gift culminating in a first-lesson charged poise. The drive reads as accumulative/textural rather than causal; beats accrete rather than sharply turn, which suits the tone but keeps the sense of pivot small. Closure is present—Marcus’s request and Elara’s acceptance mark a clear before/after—but the cost of that shift is only faintly implied. Very solid but not structurally daring or tension-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is strong: shell whispers → realization it holds archived memories → search for the other half → reunion → reintegration. Structure is cleanly one continuous scene with tightly interwoven backstory that always orients itself from present stimuli. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina’s stance toward her trauma changes with a visible cost (she regains the pain along with the love). The arc feels complete at this length without stray or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: family legacy → decades of calibrated treason → brother’s arrest → sanctuary decision → burning both documents → writing a confession. The global drive is clearly causal, and closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she sacrifices the control and safety of secrecy for exposure and uncertain consequences. The structure—single continuous scene with embedded reflection—fits the length, with no orientation issues. The only limiting factor is that external consequences remain mostly projected rather than partially dramatized, which slightly softens the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: shell + letter → names → realization about the missing → test at nexus → invitation → accepted transformation. The structure is a single continuous scene with well-integrated reflection, and the closure (her singing herself into the echo) is on the page with a clear before/after. The Global Drive Lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture), and it holds to the end. Cost is legible (“leaving everything behind”), not merely implied, giving the ending real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: wreck → globe → shrine → visions → formula → larger quest, with no real orientation or logic gaps. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: Marina leaves with the antidote and a map-like mandate to seek twelve more globes. The main weakness is that obstacles are minimal and the problem-solving feels almost effortlessly linear, so cost is conceptual more than viscerally felt. Still, for this length, the structure is clean and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece reads cleanly as an accumulative/textural scene: one night on the parapet, pressure building through layered observations of patterns until the net repair and descent. Causality is simple but coherent—whistling brings the fireflies, the whisk refracts the moon, these trigger her conceptual re-framing of unseen effort. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final recognition of anonymous care as a sustaining net is a clear before/after in understanding, with the cost being her chosen invisibility. Orientation is solid from the opening lines; no structural or temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: orchard rumor → investigation → discovery of shredded documents → revelation of Project Pomona → excavation of the diamond → ethical decision. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the letters provide an effective structural spine without derailing the present-time scene. Closure lands via an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he changes his usual MO and walks away, having redefined “truth-telling” in this world, with a visible conceptual and ethical cost. The only limitation is that the final decision point arrives and resolves quickly, with relatively little beat-by-beat tightening around alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: storm intensifies → frequencies thicken → she broadcasts → Prophet speaks → charged final image. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent and the closure—a conceptual repricing of “the old world ends…with harmonics”—lands on the page. However, the cost of closure is more implied than dramatized, and very little in her situation is materially different besides confirmation that he has emerged. Within the chosen lens it works, but without a sharper before/after price it falls short of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the music box → decision to find its owner → encounter with Elena → connection to the grandson and future archive. Closure is solidly on the page with a clear before/after in Marcus’s social role and purpose, and the “within weeks” summary is efficient if slightly telescoped. However, obstacles are soft—his search meets no real resistance, and the grandson’s interest arrives neatly, which slightly flattens tension. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a textural finish, and that holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Collectors approaching → Mira descends and unlocks the vault → ritual of resonance → transformation before they arrive, with a clear before/after. Closure is a decisive change with cost: Mira ceases to be bodily human and becomes the lighthouse’s voice, and the world’s options (ships vs. ice, Collectors vs. covenant) are reconfigured. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation debt, and every step is motivated by the early-stated stakes. The main limit is that the external antagonists never interact with her directly, so the climax tips slightly toward inevitability rather than contested outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear: rare environmental alignment → Kira’s prepared plan → enactment with rods → viaduct’s reconfiguration → conceptual social upheaval. Structure is cleanly one continuous scene with integrated backstory and a decisive closure beat when the viaduct “hummed its new tune.” The main weakness is that the operation proceeds without real complication or reversal, so while closure lands, the path there feels almost frictionless. Cost is conceptual and future-facing rather than dramatized in this scene, which slightly softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clear: present-time investigation → memory incursions → re-interpretation of Jerome’s death → Margot’s life choice, all tracking under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is a Decisive Change (she resigns and takes the lantern) plus a conceptual repricing of “preventable death” as something to intervene on before the body drops. The cost is gestured at—leaving a stable institutional post for a self-directed, riskier path—but not deeply dramatized in terms of concrete consequences or alternatives. Still, the throughline holds without orientation issues, and the final image reweights the opening effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: Marcus arrives because of a prison promise, presents the heart and journal, Eliza chooses to repair, and that work culminates in a reweighted stance toward her brother and herself. The story maintains a single, coherent drive—can Thomas’s posthumous act alter Eliza’s relationship to his harm?—and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration in her “maybe we deserve better” realization. Cost is legible in the felt relinquishing of a long-held grievance without pretending full forgiveness. Structurally, it’s almost entirely one continuous scene; the brief backstory is tightly anchored and directly alters the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: workshop experimentation → growing pattern-knowledge → self-transformation → flight over the acid sea. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens: her sustained study of the arrow via kaleidoscope leads to altered wings, which then reconfigure her interaction with the acid. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change and conceptual repricing—transport becomes transcendence, predator/prey reframed, other machines awakened. The main limitation is that obstacles never seriously threaten to derail the trajectory, so pressure feels more foregone than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: case file → anomalous 4827 pattern → breadcrumb decoding → discovery of shadow network → connection to Apollo-X → decision to self-archive. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one clear tightening as the personal (father) fuses with the professional (missing persons). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “missing” versus “archived,” with a decisive choice on the page. Some investigative steps are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly muting tension but not breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival → keeper’s framing → mirror room exploration → revelation via shard → reframed mission. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens; each encounter deepens understanding rather than turning on sharp reversals. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Mira decides to carry fragments as “seeds of transformation,” though the cost is conceptual more than viscerally felt. No orientation issues, but the lack of concrete obstacles keeps the arc from feeling tightly driven.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: Zurich attempt → Arctic work → one ice-watch night culminating in major calving and a settled stance, all causally and thematically aligned. The accumulative drive (her growing fluency in endings’ “music”) pays off in a resonant reconfiguration, with the final image clearly reframing death as transformation. Causality is mostly sound, but the “neurological anomaly” and her emergent ability to “feel the precise moment when things began their turn toward ending” stay a bit schematic, never concretely tested in-scene beyond atmospheric knowing. Closure lands, but the decisive cost of staying in this role remains more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—a present-evening frame with interleaved backstory—flows cleanly and orients quickly: we always know where and when we are. Causality is straightforward: past loss → lifelong tending of vineyards → arrival of daughter with letters → renewed purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus shifts from guarding vines alone to actively transmitting his way of seeing to the next generation, with the cost of his lost life with Elena still present. The simplicity of plot keeps it from feeling formally daring, but it’s solid and emotionally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean and easy to follow: prophet’s arrival → realization → gathering the walkers → descent to the maps → night of consecration → dawn return and mask removal. Causality is coherent under a mostly causal lens with accumulative texture: each step proceeds logically from the warning about fading wisdom echoes. Closure lands via a conceptual and character shift—reframing the clearings as sanctuaries and the walkers as vessels—with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that most turns unfold without resistance, so while closure is clear, the path feels almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: discovery of the case → decoding the photos → decision to stage the exhibition → communal reenactment and final photograph. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds: the decades of images build toward a conceptual revaluation of the factory’s “true production.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the factory’s purpose is repriced—and the exhibition is a concrete, causal outcome of Elara’s insight. The main limitation is the lack of dramatized resistance or complication; everything proceeds smoothly once the premise is understood, keeping the plot from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-moment library frame, a brief flashback to the last printing, then a build toward the Committee confrontation and a charged final image. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: observations about the crystal and language accrue until her decision about how to testify reconfigures the premise. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the “last dictionary” is reframed as a false ending, the crystal as the seed of a new lexicon. The main limitation is that the on-page Committee scene stops at the threshold of conflict, so the climax feels more like poised setup than a fully turned exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene causal spine: morning prophecy → the woman’s arrival → joint search → discovery → reframing of his condition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Ezra realizes his forgetting is protective, not merely tragic. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, but the structure is tight and free of orientation issues or dangling setups. The ease of achieving the central task (finding the frequency) keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: tremors → clock anomaly → camera observation → realization about time-threads and prior keeper → use of tuning fork → reversal and healing. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the single-scene structure fits the length and premise. Closure is a solid Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock reverses, the station stabilizes, and Ezra’s role shifts from would-be escapee to custodian. The primary limitation is that the world-scale stakes are mostly told rather than tested in concrete, escalating jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: diagnosis → renewed purpose → execution of the goodbye ritual, all coherently linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is immediate and stable, with no causality gaps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her final performance and the vinyl-circle installation crystallize the premise that endings are continuations, with the cost of her leaving legible. The main limiting factor is that the stakes, though clear, are never seriously challenged or complicated structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Spoon Convergence → anomalous shadows → observatory/automaton → reversed writing → realization of a prison → closing the loops. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and the closure lands: Lyra uses the observatory to seal the awakenings and accepts an ongoing guardianship. Cost is mostly conceptual (she inherits a life of containment and secrecy), and it is on the page but lightly dramatized. Some beats (e.g., learning the full scope of the threat) resolve quickly, keeping the piece from feeling as weighty as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by past events (the substitute body, Mother’s death) with a clear before/after in Thomas’s stance. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—conversation, memory, and small choices (keeping and returning the tooth) reweight his role as healer-between-worlds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot keep Elara, but he redefines healing and certainty, with visible emotional cost. The main limitation is that stakes and turns stay gentle; the scene never quite feels forced to a knife-edge decision.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: lighthouse failure → repeated grotto visits → revelation of glass’s power → public demonstration → communal adoption. Structure is straightforward two-shard (grotto discovery / harbor demonstration and evening teaching) with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus mild Resonant Reconfiguration (solitary keeper → shared guidance), but the transition is smooth to the point of near-ease, with little friction or cost. No orientation or lens issues, but the resolution feels slightly too painless for the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one cohesive scene framed by reflection, with the viral confession as off-stage catalyst and Marcus’s arrival as the on-page perturbation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the moss work, the ice pattern, and the pendant layer toward the closing image of “converting witnesses into gardeners.” Causality is modest but coherent—nothing breaks, but the on-page turn is gentle rather than pressed. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → reflection → ritual with the shell → visitation of characters → departure, with each step coherently deepening the central dilemma. The world’s mild surrealism (uphill mist, prophetic shell) holds consistent rules, and the closure beat (conceptual repricing of what stories/hope can do) lands clearly with cost. Stakes remain quiet but legible throughout, with no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara sings → the vine responds → the village gathers → the ritual returns, giving a clear before/after and on-page closure. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the final image of the blooming vine as communal reconnection is satisfying. However, obstacles are minimal and resolution comes quite smoothly once she begins humming, so the sense of earned cost is modest. The structure—essentially one continuous scene with a soft temporal glide into evening—remains coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is very clean: gathering materials → assembling the pattern → introducing safekept starlight → ignition → mapping and collapse. Causality holds under a textural lens, with each step logically emerging from prior preparation and the world’s strange rules. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: once the map is sealed, the pattern collapses, and she now holds “directions to everywhere that shouldn’t exist,” permanently reweighting the situation. The cost is primarily temporal and existential rather than dramatic, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that accumulates observational beats (light, reflections, pre-echoes) toward a conceptual shift about brokenness and wonder. Causality under the accumulative lens is coherent—each new temporal phenomenon reveals more of the device’s function and teaches her how to “repair by not repairing.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she redefines what “fixing” means and chooses preservation-of-malfunction over restoration. The cost and stakes remain more intellectual than visceral, which keeps this just below the elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: each new “weight” (grandmother, mountains, oceans, grotto itself) deepens the same central situation, building toward the final conceptual repricing that “some prisons we weave ourselves.” Causality within this lyric frame is tight—her alignment with starlight leads to capturing vaster burdens, which leads to sensing the grotto’s weight, which reshapes her understanding of her trap. Closure is strong and on-page: the final realization about self-woven prisons and the cooled lamp burner constitute a clear before/after, with the cost being her lucid acceptance of her own complicity. There are no orientation issues or lens ambiguity, though the “plot” remains mostly internal and contemplative rather than driven by external turns.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the kettle’s boil, with backstory and reflection anchored to present-tense stimuli. Pressure accumulates texturally as the kettle nears its whistle, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where she reframes loss and commits to teaching while holding the unfinished clock. Causality is quiet but intact—her carving choices and discoveries about Thomas’s lingering presence organically lead to her final stance. Closure lands clearly with a before/after in how she conceives “time” and “moving on,” with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—collecting fragments until they cohere into a “complete picture”—is clean and thematically apt, and the closure (ghost contact, narrative-time snap, lagoon restarting) lands clearly. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: her long-term collecting leads to understanding, which allows the negotiation with her ghost and the carousel’s resumed motion. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early, and the nonlinear sense of time serves the premise and payoff. The main limitation is that the external consequence of the carousel restarting remains mostly symbolic rather than tightly tied to a concrete, on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: archival discovery → arrival → sextant fragment → deciphered system → reactivated fountain → conceptual shift. Structure is linear, single-scene, and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the terminal is re-understood as a machine for hope, and Maya accepts a new role as its navigator and documentarian. The cost is mostly implicit (a new responsibility and reoriented purpose), keeping the piece structurally sound but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: the letter creates a present-moment dilemma, reflection deepens stakes, and the sunrise beat crystallizes her decision. Causality is straightforward and coherent—invitation → contemplation in the forecourt → choice to straddle both worlds. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change with an Earned Stasis flavor (she accepts the job but retains her current role), and the cost is legible in terms of divided life and leaving pure refuge. The accumulative texture of setting and memory supports, rather than blurs, the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous evening on the barge interleaved with tightly anchored reflection, all causally flowing from the sundial’s discovery. Closure lands via a conceptual and moral shift—her decision to go home and confront her father—which clearly reconfigures her options and self-understanding. The drive is more accumulative than dramatically turned, but the before/after is legible and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by the onset and lifting of fog, built around decoding the rope and deciding to transmit its knowledge. Causality is straightforward—fisherman dies, rope remains, Mara decodes, then resolves to teach—under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: knowledge as an “eternal truth” embodied in materials and patterns, with the weavers redefined as emergence rather than society. The cost is mostly implied (the fragility of losing unrecorded knowledge), so the ending feels resonant but not sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: Elara’s work with the thread, Marcus’s erosion, and the planned visit to the weavers build toward a conceptual reconfiguration of healing and presence/absence. Orientation and temporal framing are clear, and the palace carpet motif returns coherently at the end. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration / Conceptual Repricing with a palpable emotional cost (the acceptance of living as “already ended”). The main limitation is the lack of a discernible structural turn beyond deepening; the pattern enriches rather than truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid: discovery of the egg → painstaking assembly of the chamber → incubation vigil → flawed hatching → decision to embrace Novo and remain apart as a counter-song to the city. Structure is linear and coherent, with a legible escalation from preparation to experiment to result. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules (pure mechanism) are conceptually reweighted by a new, imperfect living song that begins to alter the city’s response. Stakes are more conceptual than concrete, but the before/after is clear and the cost—accepting imperfection and isolation—is present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a single, well-contained ritual scene with interleaved backstory; orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and held. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beat sequence—arrival, preparation, memory, assembly of talisman, internal reframing, departure—builds toward a resonant reconfiguration (she leaves with a new self-understanding and object). Causality is modest but coherent: the fisherman’s taught ritual leads to this specific act on this yearly return, and closure lands with legible before/after. Escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, yet the final gesture of wearing the coin as an answer to a long-standing question gives satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: anomalies → city → box/feather → touching each fountain → city’s remembering and geese resuming flight, with a clear conceptual before/after. The drive lens reads as Hybrid, leaning accumulative/textural with a causal ritual sequence, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which the world’s rules are reweighted. The main limitation is that the cost of this completion feels nearly frictionless—no real risk, sacrifice, or failure mode troubles the central ritual. Structure is otherwise tight and coherent within one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure follows an accumulative/textural lens: move from dying star to nursery, with the gear and light-harvesting pattern tying shards into a clear before/after stance. Causality is simple but coherent: tending a dying star, transiting, surveying the garden, and arriving at a birth all build to her reframed relationship with her burden. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she consciously reinterprets solitude as both burden and privilege—though the cost of that stance is more implied than sharply felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single throughline from preparatory work to the memorial’s unveiling and the grandfather’s fading, framed by the migration’s arc. Causality is clear—inheritance → commission → spectral mentorship → time pressure → completion → release—and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot twist, fitting the accumulative/lyric lens. The cost (letting the grandfather’s presence go while finishing the work) is legible on the page. There are no orientation issues or broken set-ups, though escalation is more gradual than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: a single overwind → communal harms → obsessive study → discovery of the pendulum pause → ritualized confession that re-tunes the clock and his role. Structure is tight and legible, interweaving backstory with the present climb without losing orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Theodore accepts ongoing penance with a new, ethically charged stance, and the village’s response confirms the shift. The main limitation is that the “ritual works” almost immediately, with minimal resistance or complication on the way to that closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the case → examination/decoding → reframing of her vocation → quiet resolution. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when are clear very early, and the chess clock plus night setting provide a subtle temporal frame. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing, where the tapestry’s revelations reweight her entire relationship to the cemetery, with the “plant it tomorrow” decision giving a soft but legible before/after. The main limitation is that the drive never tightens beyond contemplation, so the structural turn is more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: Mira prepares the maps → the Council meets amid those maps → their decisions shift as a direct consequence, leading to a reconfigured future. The piece reads under a Hybrid lens (causal events serving a conceptual reweighting), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: transformation via seeded systems rather than open revolt. Structure is simple but sound—prep, meeting, aftermath—with no orientation problems. The main limitation is that cost and risk stay abstract; there’s little sense anything could have gone meaningfully wrong on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night of work anchored by the pirate broadcast, moving causally from signal → decoding → encoding → delivery. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture), and the closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise as she steps into the mist toward an awakening city infused with dust-stories. Stakes and options are legible, though consequences remain projected rather than dramatized, keeping the cost mostly conceptual. Still, the “before/after” in terms of the dust’s reawakening and the city’s imminent change is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single accumulating scene from preparation to subject’s death to authorities’ arrival and ritual closure. Causality is tight—fugitives arrive because of rumors, Marlene performs her process, Creech dies during it, and the authorities’ entry feels like an inevitable consequence of the gallery’s function. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final paragraphs reprice the gallery’s promise and Marlene’s role with a clear before/after understanding. The main limitation is that turns are conceptual more than dramatic; there’s no major surprise or structural risk beyond the well-executed reveal that the portraits are evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is tightly structured as a single confrontational scene with a clean causal chain: his interception of reports → her arrival → ideological clash → revelation that the academy already knows → invitation to collaborate → his reframed acceptance. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when, what’s wrong), and the sunken-city premise is efficiently embedded without derailing the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus’s stance shifts from solitary rebel to co-conspirator in preserving obscured truth, with a legible before/after. The cost—complicity in hiding reality and surrendering the fantasy of immediate impact—is implied but could be sharpened by one explicit acknowledgment or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from impending program death to an unexpected communal “last stand,” culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration that arts persist in people, not institutions. Causality is coherent (her message → students arrive → they work to rediscover the modes → she passes on the rosette) and the single-scene frame suits the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she accepts retirement and storage, yet passes the symbolic core on. The main weak point is how easily the five modes are “found” without on-page struggle, slightly softening the sense of cost and effort at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: moons align → seed can sprout → Mira prepares the space and plants it → the neural garden emerges → conceptual reconfiguration of rebellion lands in the closing image. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by the first paragraph, and the backstory about the orchards and the Ministry is efficiently woven into present action. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with a coherent RR/CR closure as the greenhouse becomes a living archive. The main limitation is that nothing concrete pushes back in scene, so structural tension comes more from unfolding wonder than from narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → drone collapse + dampener failure → Mira can’t lie → mounting necessity to reveal the bees → public broadcast. Structure is straightforward single-POV with backstory smoothly embedded and a clear before/after in the city’s knowledge. Closure lands via a decisive change (public revelation) with conceptual cost, though the immediate acceptance by the crowd softens felt jeopardy. A slightly sharper sense of risk or fallout at the end would deepen the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: Marina tracks the displaced objects, arrives at the bay, uses the shard to perceive the underlying pattern, reinterprets the houses’ behavior, and then enacts a small but decisive offering. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid—each detail (noticing drift, cataloguing, shared house quality, object migrations) tightens toward the conceptual reveal that the bay is a repository of hush and grief. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: Marina’s understanding of the neighborhood and her own noticing is reweighted, and the act of leaving the shard with the implication it will reappear elsewhere gives a legible before/after. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is the relatively low on-page resistance; events unfold smoothly with little obstructive pressure or surprise in the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is very clear: Marina’s descent and ampoule prompt telepathic contact; contact prompts cascading visions; visions overturn Marina’s theory and force a new stance; that stance reconfigures Thessaly’s centuries-long expectation of judgment. The “cascading memories” structure is cleanly taught and then used to escalate stakes from garden to council to near-genocide to self-inflicted cataclysm. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: Thessaly remains paralyzed but her role and self-understanding decisively change. Costs—Marina’s career narrative compromised, Thessaly’s mass drowning accepted as permanent—are legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clear single-POV, single-location arc with reflection interleaved, and the drive lens reads as Hybrid (situational premise with causal/accumulative deepening). Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when-as-weird) and the loop revelation plus the 17-billion-heartbeat equivalence gives the structure a chilling middle turn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Marcus commits to continued climbing with mathematically grounded certainty of rupture, and the cost—his looped lifetime against Sarah’s diverged path—is on the page. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the on-page moment of change is subtle and largely cognitive, without a distinct decisive act beyond reaffirming the existing pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: rooftop present → memory/daydream → painting → online response → community space, with each step clearly following the last. The closure is a solid resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Mira’s insomnia and the brush become a bridge between “lost” languages and a living community. Stakes stay modest and there’s no strong decisive turn, but for a lyric piece the escalation and cadence shift toward the greenhouse-as-gathering-place land well. No orientation or causality breaks; the main cap is the relative softness of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: thaw → emerging frescoes → intensifying rosewater scent → dripping and ice cracks → all-night cataloging forms a coherent pressure arc. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she can’t stop erasure but reframes her work as transforming “loss into legacy,” with a clear before/after stance on the same mission. A slightly more crystallized on-page decision at the peak (e.g., what to let go of) would strengthen the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: yoyo research → recognition of the lighthouse → ascent → dismantling/rebinding the stone → inversion and new beam, with a clear before/after. The single-scene structure and spatial orientation are legible, and closure is decisive both physically (stone inversion) and conceptually (past illuminated). However, there’s little real resistance once the ritual begins; the stone “writhes” but never complicates her plan or forces adaptation. The backstory about the original keeper is somewhat expositional but doesn’t break the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is strong: childhood theft of the clasp → death/resuscitation → nightly returns → using the dictionary’s paradox → confronting Fear and transforming it. The structure is tight and single-scene with well-embedded backstory; the revelation that Cornelius is Fear’s first victim and the subsequent dissolution supply both plot and emotional closure. Closure lands clearly via a decisive change (Fear contained, carnival released) and a conceptual repricing (Fear as lonely, needing understanding). The only ding is that the spell solution, once invoked, resolves the central problem with minimal resistance, reducing late-stage complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: recursive current → discovery of harmonic potential → escalating performance → rupture of the current → new mission. Causality holds tightly under a mostly Causal lens: her reading of clouds informs tactics, the soundwork attracts whales, and the interference visibly breaks the spiral. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a concrete before/after in the orchard’s motion and a reoriented future goal via the cloud coordinates. The cost is present but relatively light—exhaustion, bodily strain—so the ending registers as earned but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: whistle silence → telescope observation → discovery of the crack → translation → realization of the greater threat → choice to leave. The piece lands on a strong Charged Poise closure as Mira exits, the turtles begin to move, and the watchers crack further, with clear before/after stakes. Structure is linear and coherent within one continuous arc, with backstory integrated through present cues (“three days ago,” “seventeen days ago”) without confusion. The only limitation is that the expedition’s fate and the world-scale threat remain entirely offstage, keeping the plot from feeling fully maximized at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and well-contained: last petal/end of waiting → Marcus arrives with Ministry orders → confrontation over the letter → reveal of already-sent copies → his renunciation. Closure works as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: the lie’s hegemony is conceptually broken, though the physical danger remains. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. The cost is more told than dramatized (we’re assured the Ministry will destroy her, but don’t see concrete consequences), which keeps the structural impact slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and legible: the drawbridge rises, Edmund traverses and explores the pavilion, performs his hidden preservation ritual, and exits under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is straightforward (storms expose the cornerstone gap; his profession and family memory motivate the note-in-bottle; demolition timeline and tide frame his window). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he seals his grandmother’s story into the stone and commits to returning, with a palpable emotional and conceptual cost. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that the on-page stakes remain modest and largely interior, with no sharp turn beyond the planned ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous descent-and-work sequence under time pressure, with each step logically following from the last (blackout → descent → detection → marking → generators reactivating → withdrawal). The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: we gather detail and stakes as the pattern of forgery emerges and time runs out. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she cannot finish but has “marked enough,” accepting a partial, ongoing victory with conceptual cost. No major causality breaks or orientation issues, though the turns are more quietly procedural than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense gem polishing, interleaved memories, leading to the discovery of “possibility” within a gem and the consequent reorientation toward lantern-making with dream-gems. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mei’s stance toward Lin’s absence has clearly shifted. The story holds one dominant drive (transforming grief) and closes that arc without loose threads for this scope. The main limitation is that the decisive turn (from preservation to transformation) is more reflective than actively dramatized in a single charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear: Amira engineers an opportunity, uses the scanner, discovers the pooled potential, and reacts by transmitting the data before security arrives. The cooling-cycle clock, the alarm, and the security breach all tighten the scene without confusion, and the observatory-elevation rule is paid off at the discovery beat. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the world’s physics and moral economy are reweighted by the revelation that severed futures can be returned. The main limitation is that institutional and personal consequences are mostly projected, not yet partially felt, which softens the sense of immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: anomaly → floor-message discovery → realization about the gaps → thermal star trails → matrices recovered → frequency activated → conceptual reconfiguration of belonging. Structure is tight and single-scene, and the closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing with a before/after for Kira. What’s missing at a higher tier is sharper complication or a turn that meaningfully constrains options; the puzzle yields with little resistance. The cost is primarily internal and somewhat gentle, but it is present.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the watch hand summons him, the carvings reveal the grandfather’s crimes, this recontextualizes his career and forces a choice. Structure is tight and linear, with backstory woven in via clear present cues, and closure lands as a decisive renunciation with cost. The unseen arranger of the carvings is a minor ellipsis but reads as intentional rather than a plot hole. The piece fits the single-scene, single-POV frame well under a causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single scene anchored in the present, with backstory interleaved and always tethered to concrete triggers like the drawer pull and the mist. Causality is coherent—past strike → power imbalance → upcoming exchange → conditional acceptance of apology—and the story lands in a clear charged poise as they prepare for tomorrow. Closure is present but relatively quiet: Elara’s stance is affirmed rather than significantly altered in the scene, which keeps the emotional turn modest. The new-moon timing and “down payment” of forgiveness provide a satisfying, if subtle, before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-day outing framed by a single scene, with backstory reliably anchored and feeding his current choices (paddling to pole nineteen, deciding to return and teach). Causality is coherent under a situational/causal hybrid lens: his past failure → avoidance → utility-pole system → present confrontation with the site of his failure → quiet re-engagement with navigation. Closure—a resonant reconfiguration where he reframes “brokenness” and steps toward guiding again—lands clearly with emotional cost. The arc is modest and internal, so the inciting “test” of his change (this particular paddle) feels low-pressure rather than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the first line (procedure → coordinates → cave), and the causal chain to the final choice is straightforward and legible. The piece lands a solid Charged Poise closure with Marcus committing to the first bridge, clearly redefining his options and future. The obituaries → cave → mission progression is efficient, though the obituary-decoding setup feels slightly underused once we’re in the cave. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, but it is conceptually strong and unmistakable at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: oracle-like fortune → journey to orchard → uncorking the vial → transformation → reconfiguration of Mira’s role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns outwardly human but fundamentally changed into a bridge, with a clear before/after. Structure is simple but appropriate to the length, with no orientation issues. The main weakness is that the pathway to success feels relatively unimpeded, so the decisive turn is more inevitable than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climb to the glade → invocation of family customs and tools → apparition of the mother → restorative card spread → mending of the saucer and reframed birth announcement. Causality under a lyric, magical frame remains coherent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where past and present are re-mapped rather than “fixed.” The cost—Elara accepting that her guilt remains even as time is reclaimed—is explicit and thematically charged. Only minor softness lies in how easily the ritual seems to work once initiated, with little sense of possible failure beyond the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single continuous scene: meditation → locating the anomalous photograph → using Kwan Yin’s Tear → opening the gap → stitching/integration. Causality is strong and legible, and the closure (the barrier ceasing to exist and Mei becoming “the first human complete”) functions as a clear resonant reconfiguration. However, the enormous declared stakes (“redeem or destroy what remained of human consciousness”) resolve too smoothly; there is little sense that destruction is ever a live possibility once the ritual starts. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, which keeps the structural arc from fully matching its apocalyptic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece functions well under an accumulative/textural lens: details (philanthropy, prophecy, planets, volcano, fireflies) layer toward a single, decisive metamorphosis. Closure is strong: Elara dissolves, the sand and bottles hold her imprint, and the lightning bugs carry forward her agency, with a clear before/after. Causality is soft but coherent—the alignment and her presence here are motivated by her lifetime of “orchestrated coincidences.” A slight overreliance on summary backstory in the middle keeps it from feeling fully taut.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → Thorne’s move to the sundial → coded signal set → confirmation with Amara → return to apparent normalcy with the revolution primed. The piece lands a solid Charged Poise ending: by dawn, the plan will activate and there is no going back. That said, the price and practical risks remain mostly conceptual, with no on-page complication beyond a single tense footstep that quickly turns into alliance. Structure is coherent and appropriate for the length but not yet maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: ritual preparation → activation of the pattern → revelation from the lead eel → reconfigured purpose at the end, with clear causal links between each move. The closure is a conceptual repricing where Yann reframes frictionlessness and her curse, then chooses to begin the next pattern, which provides a solid before/after. The backstory of the grandmother and the universe’s first friction is folded into the present in a way that supports, rather than derails, the central action. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than situationally urgent, which keeps this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clean: the storm-night vigil, backstory of exile, discovery of the envelope, and current act of subversive creation all layer toward a closure that reweights her situation rather than flipping it. Causality is coherent—finding the negatives teaches her how to use the censors’ deletions, which shapes her present tactic of planting “seeds in the negative space.” Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: revolution reframed as invisible, patient work in intervals (“vigil… until all masks would finally slip”), with the observatory’s turning dome and mist-through-chains image freezing that stance. The one limitation is that no new decisive change occurs in the ending scene itself; the final beat crystallizes an already-established pattern rather than materially tightening her options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: anchored setting, a framed meeting, the duel, and a coded-resolution beat that completes the sundial/needle-card pattern. Causality is intact—her decoding leads to the meeting, which leads to a furthering of covert resistance. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the “trinity of coded resistance” and the promise of ongoing duels. The main weakness is that on-page cost in the present is mostly conceptual, leaning on backstory rather than a fresh, felt inflection of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense night in the container library interwoven with a single, well-motivated backstory spine about Marcus and the resistance. Causality is mostly accumulative/textural—each memory informs why this anthology and these names matter, culminating in the decision to copy and scatter the book. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn: October recommits to her method with the anthology nearly ready and the tin of names charged. The main limitation is that the stakes remain largely conceptual; no on-page disruption narrows options or forces a consequential choice tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story’s causal chain—compass storms → lost wife → found reels → learned harmonics → tonight’s intensified disturbance → corridor and return—is clean and accumulates pressure toward a clear on-page closure. The closure unit (Sophia stepping through, clock moving, and Marion’s reframed understanding of “home” and refuge) lands with conceptual and emotional cost, though the success of this particular night’s attempt feels a touch convenient rather than being foregrounded as a high-risk, iterated crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: setup on the ridge → ingestion of the seed → immersion in memories → recognition of paradox as design → return and decision. Causality within the Situational/Accumulative lens holds: each step naturally prompts the next and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing at the ledger entry and island’s survival. Closure is on-page and coherent, though the Council’s anticipated challenge and any real risk to Mira remain notional, keeping cost mostly conceptual. Orientation is strong throughout with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: compass, lace, bonsai, and backstory interweave toward a clear closure where Kenji passes the compass on and commits to writing Yuki. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: each object revelation and teaching moment deepens his relationship to severance and remembrance. The closure (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis) lands on-page with the cost of long-delayed apology clearly implied. There are no orientation issues, and the war/grandmother backstory is tightly anchored to present action.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on montage/summary covering weeks, which flattens the causal tension of the resignation; the decisive moment happens off-page. The resolution—demolition postponed because notes magically predict structural failure—feels convenient and unearned, removing the weight of her sacrifice too quickly. The mechanism of "dust predicting structural collapse" strains credibility within the established realistic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, moving from the ledger revelation to a Decisive Change (keeping the list to warn others). Backstory density is high but anchors the stakes; the closure lands with a legible shift in tactics, though the "warning" plan emerges somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of uncomplicated success: the protagonist tries an experiment, it works immediately, and she feels validated. The closure is a "realization" ending that lacks a felt cost or a meaningful setback in the present action to earn the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing "three days" of travel and "months" of work instead of dramatizing a pivotal scene. This synopsis-like structure prevents the formation of immediate causal pressure; the story relies on a montage of success rather than a specific, high-stakes moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("On the fourth week," "Six months in") rather than scenic dramatization, diluting the tension of the sanctions. While the closure lands a successful Resonant Reconfiguration of the bell's meaning, the middle section tells the story of survival rather than showing the pivotal moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is legible and the closure (releasing the photos) lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's purpose. However, causality relies heavily on destiny-driven conveniences—the sudden "past life memory" and the impulse purchase of the tear "without knowing why"—which weakens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure relies on a "realization ex machina" where the prop disintegrates on its own, removing the obstacle without protagonist effort. The potential cost of losing the memories is explicitly negated ("she no longer needed them"), rendering the ending weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    Major logical incoherence fractures causality. The mechanics of the escape are baffled: the text focuses on crumbling seedpod fletching while the chain snaps, obscuring the physical cause (leverage? impact?) of the break. Additionally, the premise of an "abandoned" center where keys are pressed "weekly" by outsiders (who don't free him) contradicts his status as a "captive attraction."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc follows a clear accumulation of pressure leading to a distinct conceptual epiphany. Closure is achieved through a "Conceptual Repricing" where the meaning of betrayal is transformed into a biological necessity. The time jump ("Hours passed, maybe days") blurs tension slightly but fits the dreamlike logic of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean with a clear inciting moment and resolution; the "truth revealed" closure lands well. The flower code subplot, while atmospheric, feels slightly ornamental and disconnected from the core causal chain of the portrait heist itself.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is functional, following a clear linear path from setup to encounter, but the arrival of the couple relies on convenience rather than causality. The closure lands on a Conceptual Repricing (the room becomes a confessional), but the lack of resistance earlier in the scene makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The inciting incident is clear, but the resolution relies on a "magic wand" causality: decoding equations on a cast allows Marcus to instantly reverse a physical shell's resonance via his phone. This lack of logical friction robs the climax of mechanical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative loop—waiting, almost ending, then deciding to wait longer—lacks a decisive change or paid cost; it reads as a "false alarm" structure. The causal link between the star flickering and the realization that it *won't* die is opaque, making the resolution feel arbitrary. Orientation and drive lens are clear, but the closure lacks impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative structure leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (consciousness as maintenance). Causality is driven by the "temporal module" premise, which works well, though the setup feels slightly convenient. The closure is distinct and effectively recontextualizes the protagonist's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene is coherent and structurally sound, but the inciting pressure is deflated by the revelation that the external conflict (Marcus's theft) was resolved "yesterday" off-page. This turns the climax into a retrospective debrief rather than a high-stakes confrontation where the outcome is in doubt, limiting the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from established routine to a distinct moment of transmission (passing the marble). The flashback to the inspector is exposition-heavy but necessary; the closure lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration of the luck concept.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative is coherent, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the physical danger (station shuddering) evaporates without a paid price. The ending provides satisfaction but lacks the "felt cost" required for higher bands; the equilibrium is restored too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to a decisive supernatural interaction. Closure lands firmly with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the restored, co-signed program), though the "next morning" jump slightly diffuses the immediate tension of the blackout climax.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the fever's aftermath to a verified discovery and a decisive closure act (the smudging). The ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the "margins" not as neglect but as protection. Causality is driven by the protagonist's specific perception, though the initial discovery relies slightly on the "gift" as a shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on the synchronicity of the radio confession matching the exact moment of discovery, which strains causality even for a ghost story. However, the closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Sometimes explorers found her," "They always asked") rather than a specific, singular scene with immediate causality. The timeline drifts through "untold seasons" without anchoring a specific dramatic present, reducing the story to a fable-like exposition of a state of being rather than a structured narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, using the eclipse's progression to drive the ritual release of the curl. The closure (releasing the hair) is a legible Decisive Change that resonates with the setup. However, the inciting incident—mailing a curl just to bring it back to a specific ridge—feels slightly contrived to force the ritual mechanics rather than arising organically from character need.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear arc of discovery, investigation, and realization. Orientation is established early. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the "bronze quiet" is recontextualized from an ending to a pause, giving meaning to Thrain's isolation without erasing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Situational drive, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Chen exits his role. However, the plot mechanics rely heavily on the "pantomime of coincidence" to explain how specific targets receive specific cookies; this introduces a layer of convenience that softens the causal logic of his "mastermind" status.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the setup of the loop to the unraveling of the demon. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of stillness from prison to possibility—lands effectively on the page. However, the causality relies on abstract assertions ("emptiness held more truth") that operate by dream logic rather than narrative inevitability, slightly distancing the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Lyric logic where memory and prophecy converge, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The transition from writing fortunes to conducting the symphony is earned thematically, though the causality is dream-like. The cost—surrendering to the non-linear "now"—is legible, though the "exhaustion" constraint feels slightly more declared than demonstrated through obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is linear and relies on a "magic button" resolution (pressing the specific rune) to solve the central conflict. The inciting incident is backstory, leaving the piece as an extended climax that resolves too neatly through the prop's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "try and succeed" path without complication or reversal. The closure operates as a "soft reset" where the central problem (numbness) is resolved completely without a visible, felt cost or trade-off, failing the requirement for a decisive change with price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is solid, but the narrative relies heavily on a summarized backstory flashback ("six nights ago") to generate tension, which dilutes the immediacy of the present scene. The closure is legible as a Decisive Change, but the inciting pressure feels largely retrospective rather than unfolding in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path from discovery to epiphany, grounded effectively by the sensory details. Closure lands as a functional Conceptual Repricing of her trade, though the lack of complications or reversals in the middle makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The accumulative structure effectively peels back narrative layers, and the orientation is solid. However, the plot relies on a convenience mechanic (alien visions) to deliver exposition about the rope's history. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (Marcus understands the "eternal joke"), but the lack of an active obstacle makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on "consensus reality" where the community instantly understands and joins the music without friction or miscommunication. While the Conceptual Repricing of perfection to incompletion creates closure, the lack of felt cost or obstacle flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct closure (Earned Stasis) where Vera reaffirms her role. The "cost" of her choice—emotional isolation—is legible but largely conceptual; the ending lands smoothly but lacks a sharp, unexpected deepening of the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure relies on synopsis-style summary to bridge months and multiple locations, violating the scope expectation of dramatized scenes or tight shards. Critical moments—convincing the captain, the reconciliation, the library's revival—are narrated from a distance rather than unfolded with causal pressure, dissipating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("The search became ritual," "Three months ago") rather than dramatized scene work. The linear progression of success—weave, search, find, fix—lacks causal density or complications, resulting in low-cost closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The linear structure moves efficiently from inciting incident to resolution, but the climax relies on a convenient epiphany where drawings function as literal keys without prior setup of that mechanic. The resolution—the giant waking and ending the city's age—is a massive event treated with lowered gravity, lacking the catastrophic weight such a systemic collapse should carry.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the protagonist executes a pre-solved puzzle ("She'd spent months mapping") rather than confronting a live problem in the scene. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (redefining loss), but the "explain-everything" dialogue from Elias deflates the ambiguity and tension. The ending feels more like a thematic summary than a dramatic consequence of the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative creates a tight causal chain driven by the power outage, where the failure of the lights necessitates the protagonist's intervention. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship, marked by the decision to relinquish the tapes, validating the "collaboration" lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path from observation to transformation, with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) that alters the protagonist's nature. The pacing is steady, though the linear progression lacks a sharp structural twist or complication beyond the central inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight and linear, utilizing the tidal window to create natural urgency. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange of a static heirloom for a fluid, creative future. The ending feels earned, resolving the internal conflict (survival vs. meaning) through a concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Conceptual Repricing closure, but the causality is soft; the transition from confusion to enlightenment happens via instruction rather than narrative pressure. The inciting incident (the pearl) and the resolution are linked by a "lecture" scene rather than a dramatized trial.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative spans a full year, relying on montage and summary ("The archive grew...") rather than a continuous scene with immediate pressure. This scope violation dilutes the tension, as the "struggle" to archive is told as a successful process rather than shown as a precarious attempt in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear and legible, but the narrative operates as a linear tour without complication, reversal, or risk. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (return with knowledge), but because the journey demanded no sacrifice, the ending lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    The three-day scope forces the narrative into summary mode, preventing the formation of a distinct, high-pressure scene required for this length. The resolution lacks agency; the tile "reveals its true pattern" on the final morning, solving the puzzle for the protagonist rather than demanding a decisive tactical leap.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid, and the "Decisive Change" closure lands effectively with the crew's departure. However, the lack of active obstacles or setbacks creates a somewhat linear progression where events unfold convenient to the protagonist's desires rather than through earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from the breach to the trade; the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is earned with visible material and emotional cost (ashes, money, legacy).

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a linear "tourist" structure: arrival, observation, validation, and departure, lacking the required closure cost or reconfiguration. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—she gets exactly what she came for with no complications—resulting in a vignette that lacks narrative torque or a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative lens holds firmly, building density through discovered journals to the final signature. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (joining the collective), though the transition "As weeks passed" relies on summary to bridge the gap between discovery and the spring tide climax.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "convenient relative" appearing to deliver comprehensive exposition, shortcutting the protagonist's investigation. While the text self-consciously acknowledges this contrivance, it remains a structural crutch that robs the story of organic discovery and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story builds a compelling setup but collapses into a summary-heavy resolution ("Within days... protected by the very laws") that bypasses dramatized conflict. This "magic gavel" ending resolves the external threat through off-screen bureaucratic success, devoid of the felt cost or sacrifice required for a satisfying literary closure. The transition from threat to total victory is too smooth and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the situational pressure of the evacuation deadline and the fleeting ice phenomenon. The chemical timer provides a strong causal mechanism for the climax, and the closure—exchanging the Earth grain for the lunar image—lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the site with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear problem-solution arc with clear orientation and drive. However, the closure is a straightforward victory ("job done") that lacks a felt price or resonant reconfiguration; the outcome is never truly in doubt, and the ending satisfies without reweighting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the Decisive Change at the end provides closure. However, the inciting epiphany—condensation on a window perfectly matching a geological formation—strains credibility, and the stranger's arrival coinciding exactly with this discovery is a convenience that lowers the causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative spans decades, violating the short-story scope default of a single scene or focused sequence; it reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized event. The closure is logically contradictory: the town is described as a "ghost town" despite being populated by Thomas and his children, confusing the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, with a clear orientation and a logical progression from survival to transcendence. The recontextualization of the distress signal from a call for rescue to a beacon for sacrifice is a strong "Conceptual Repricing" that lands the closure effectively, though the emotional weight relies heavily on the sudden introduction of the daughter stake.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (testimony embedded in the lattice) is resonant. However, the logic of the door being "ajar for thirty years" conflicts slightly with the "desperate fingernails" detail, creating confusion about the physical constraints of his imprisonment prior to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is coherent, but the climax relies on a time-locked external trigger ("Every hundred years") rather than protagonist action. The logic contradicts itself: the ghost claims the debt was "his—to let me go," yet she is the one who physically breaks the bead to resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative reads as a procedural vignette rather than a story with a causal arc; the protagonist performs a magical routine that succeeds without complication or reversal. The closure (illustration coming to life) provides spectacle but lacks a distinct, felt cost or a reconfiguring of stakes beyond the successful completion of a task.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is legible and orientation is clear. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration (names on the sundial), though the "grandmother knew you'd come back" beat relies on convenient foresight rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative functions as a linear procedural vignette rather than a story with causal tension; it orients well but lacks a decisive turn or complication. The closure relies on the completion of a task without the required "felt or conceptual cost" or reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear situational drive that holds tension through the climax with Minister Crane. The flashback to General Marsh is efficiently integrated as reflection/memory without stalling momentum. Closure lands as a strong moment of Charged Poise, with the final chart prepared and the cost of her perilous existence palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is solid with a clear causal chain and effective closure where the shard's destruction marks a permanent state change. The mechanism of "time folding" is slightly convenient, effectively solving the communication problem via magical assertion, but the emotional logic holds and the ending lands with a distinct cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing and the physical cost of giving up the coral. However, the sudden arrival of the "diverse cast" (veteran, nurse) in the final beat feels contrived and dilutes the earned intimacy of the dyad.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear ascent of accumulation without a distinct turning point or reversal. The "knowledge network" functions as a deus ex machina that lowers difficulty rather than complicating it. Closure lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting impermanence), but the lack of prior obstacle makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the loop structure is taught effectively through the mural layers and reflected voices. Orientation is strong. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing (choosing wonder over certainty), though the mechanism of the "wall voice" explaining the plot reduces the protagonist's agency in discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Excellent economy; the single scene effectively creates a "handoff" structure where the inciting arrival leads directly to a sacrificial closure (Decisive Change). The causality holds firmly under a situational lens, with the insect defense mechanism providing a satisfying, logic-consistent resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary, spanning centuries without establishing a concrete "now" or a single continuous scene, which violates the scope default. Consequently, there is no immediate causal chain, and the closure reads as a generalized state rather than a specific event.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is legible, but the inciting incident relies heavily on the coincidence of the specific target song appearing in the chime at this exact moment. The resolution is linear and low-cost; the chime breaks as a natural consequence of the premise, not as a price Mira chooses to pay to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the climax relies on the ink well’s magical glow to externally validate the translation, which shortcuts the intellectual causality. The resolution functions as a "magic key" moment rather than a result of the protagonist's agency forcing a change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from observation to deduction to resolution, anchored by the "breathing" timeline. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where technical specs masquerade as social engineering—lands effectively with the cost of anonymity ("She wouldn't claim credit"), fulfilling the prompt's structural requirements well.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure relies heavily on a montage of passing time ("Three months ago," "By summer," "One evening") rather than a continuous scene or tight shards, which dilutes immediate tension. The resolution depends on a high-magnitude coincidence (Theodore's wife happened to be Margot's former employer) rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear trajectory with a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the protagonist reframes loss. The causality of the magical realism (weather codes mapping to corn) is established early and holds consistently. The orientation is immediate and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story functions as an atmospheric vignette rather than a causal narrative; events unfold linearly without obstacle or reversal. The unexplained manifestation of a burnt feather inside a sterile tank breaks the established sci-fi logic without sufficient grounding, acting as a convenient prompt rather than a causal driver.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, but the resolution relies on a convenient external trigger (the sprout) rather than an earned internal shift. The Conceptual Repricing is legible but feels intellectually summarized in the penultimate paragraph rather than viscerally paid for by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well, building from the child to the teen to the final reflection. The orientation is solid, and the closure (the guitar pick as a token of connection) lands. However, the mechanism in the board acts as a convenient plot device that removes difficulty from the performance scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a pivotal turn or complication; the ritual succeeds simply because Mira wills it, with the magic system smoothing over any potential obstacles. While the ending achieves a "Charged Poise," the lack of on-page resistance makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building sensory detail toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is legible—he accepts the loss of the physical space to preserve the lesson—but the transition is somewhat smooth. The pacing is effective, though the "noctilucent" exposition slightly drags the opening orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a legible arc of reflection leading to a change in stance (Conceptual Repricing), anchored well by the porcelain box. However, the narrative is heavily weighted toward flashback and summary (approx. 50%), which slows momentum and leaves the present-tense action (walking, opening a box) feeling thin until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a substantial backstory block ("The serene upheaval had begun six months ago") that saps immediate momentum. The ending is a soft summary ("Tomorrow, she would begin teaching...") rather than a decisive on-page closure unit with felt cost. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist succeeds in her ritual without facing a significant obstacle or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (enter, find, listen, write, leave) with high clarity but low causality; events happen *to* Mira rather than because of difficult decisions. The closure relies on a "tidy" summation in the notebook rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the status quo with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative sets up a time constraint (the morning bells) and then resolves it via a retroactive convenient magic ("she'd painted that possibility yesterday"), which deflates the scene's primary tension without requiring an on-page cost or choice. While the ending achieves a poetic Resonant Reconfiguration with the sparrow, the causality leading there is soft; the rules of her reality-warping ability are undefined, making the solution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and effective, utilizing the memory-glass clipboard to physically manifest the shift from stalemate to connection. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the light changing from red to "something in between" creates a tangible, earned resolution without over-promising total peace. The breakthrough is causally linked to Mara's risky deviation from tradition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from the setup of the drought map to the intimate burial and final conceptual shift. Closure is achieved through a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where the concept of salvation is successfully repriced as destruction, landing with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (opening the sanctuary) is legible, but the linear progression lacks a pivotal turn or complication. The resolution arrives without a clear price paid by the protagonist, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving effectively from the aftermath of conflict to a crystallized artistic decision. The backstory regarding his puppet shows provides necessary context but momentarily stalls momentum; however, the closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing of his method.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure effectively supports the fable-like tone, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. While the butterfly's arrival feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, the causal logic of the "signals" holds together within the established magical realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    The drive lens (Causal/Process) works well until the climax relies on an extreme coincidence—finding her specific ancestor's name on a random scrap. This "chosen one" turn feels too symmetric and convenient, weakening the otherwise strong conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The loop structure provides a strong, legible closure that recontextualizes the entire journey as memory. While the physical causality of the backward time interaction (prying the door) is soft, the Conceptual Repricing lands effectively. The narrative orientation is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on the convenient coincidence of Mars aligning exactly when she looks, removing agency and tension from the inciting interaction. The "knowledge uncloak" beat acts as a magic-pill solution that bypasses the work of decoding, flattening the climax into an unearned epiphany. Closure is achieved through a mechanical "activation" sequence rather than a causal chain of hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a Deus Ex Machina resolution where a magical music box instantly solves both the external threat and the complex internal trauma of the antagonist. There is no earned causality or cost; the protagonist simply waits for the antagonist to arrive and hands him the solution. The closure feels unearned because the mechanism of change is external magic rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers from a "smooth ride" structure with zero effective resistance; the solution (breathing) is arbitrary and works instantly. Closure relies on a contradictory "gift": Elara claims dreams shouldn't be captured, then immediately hands him a mirror where the dream is captured. The ending lacks a felt cost, as the protagonist gains exactly what he wanted with no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is functional but suffers from "symmetric satisfaction"; the problem is introduced and immediately solved with the perfect tools found via convenient "accident." The lack of complications during the mending process flattens the tension, resulting in a tidy, linear progression without significant causal struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic ("retreat to logic's foundation" leading to a bathroom) that feels forced by prompt requirements rather than causally motivated. While the loop closure is legible, the middle section hinges on a convenient information download rather than a decisive change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path with a legible resolution (Conceptual Repricing of the library). However, the closure lacks a felt cost; the negotiation dissolves tension rather than forcing a difficult trade-off, resulting in a "correct answer" ending rather than a dramatic earning of the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight, with a clear situational drive lens that holds through the surreal logic. Closure is decisive and resonant; the choice to leave the "garden" to preserve the "proof" creates a legible cost (loss of connection) without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is sound, with a clear linear progression from discovery to resolution under the pressure of the clock. While the closure is legible as a Decisive Change, the cost of entering the merged space is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The protagonist moves through the plot points without a moment of genuine doubt or significant setback.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with minimal resistance; the ritual simply works. Closure is achieved through a "magic button" resolution where the antagonist capitulates immediately, resulting in a low sense of earned consequence. The "updating maps" cost feels trivial compared to the established threat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience, utilizing a *deus ex machina* (the shard landing exactly where needed) and a rule-breaking power shift (retrocognition becoming precognition) to provide the solution. The closure, while imagistically distinct, is unearned by the character's agency, as the universe solves the central puzzle for her.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative reads as a vignette or prologue with a weak Accumulative lens rather than a story with causal drive; the ending offers a soft conceptual shift (from loss to potential) but lacks a decisive change or felt cost. The closure feels like a continuation of the established status quo rather than a reconfiguration earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from arrival to execution, but the closure lacks a felt cost. The resolution—mass participation and immediate success—feels frictionless and unearned ("symmetric satisfaction"). The story moves logically but fails to impose a hard choice or sacrifice that would validate the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a static impasse to a shift in perspective driven by the environment and dialogue. Closure is legible (Chen’s return is foretold/implied), though the resolution relies heavily on a single conversational breakthrough rather than a costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective arc from anticipation to climax (inversion) to resolution. The closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the safety concept. The causality of the doll cracking is magical rather than strictly agent-driven, but it fits the established logic of the grandmother's gift and the inversion event.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the passenger is successfully transformed. While structural execution is clean and the pacing fits the length, the progression is linear and lacks a pivotal moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "puzzle-box" structure where obstacles are overcome immediately by specific tools without failure or adaptation. The sunrise deadline proves to be an aesthetic constraint rather than a high-stakes fail state, softening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The structure is a linear vignette demonstrating a routine process rather than a narrative with causal turns. The ending is cyclical stasis that validates the status quo without exacting a new cost or forcing a reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina: the bolt appeared "inexplicably" on her counter in backstory, and the climax involves simply following an instruction to turn it. This breaks the causal chain; the resolution is gifted rather than earned. The "Converging promises" provide situational pressure, but the solution lacks logical groundwork or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is excellent; the mechanism of the gramophone directly informs the stakes and the final choice. Closure is a pristine Decisive Change with a visible cost (loss of estate and power) that lands effectively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Decisive Change (transformation), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the progression feels somewhat ritualistic and corridor-like; the program dictates the plot steps, removing the sense of risk or potential failure until the final surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure works well for this quiet archive setting, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of his task) is legible. However, the mechanics of the button—how a foster child returned it to a sealed 1967 file in a secure archive—strain plausibility slightly, relying on "message in a bottle" logic that feels physically unearned despite its thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.4)
    The central mechanism—reading a specific coordinate map in a lagoon's reflection—breaks the story's technological/dystopian logic, acting as a convenient magical fix. The resolution relies on a "press button to win" upload that resolves the conflict instantly without onsite complications. The off-screen capture of the leaders lowers the immediate stakes of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with legible closure (the prophecy sleeping), but the progression lacks causal friction. The ritual works exactly as planned without complication, making the middle section feel like a procedural execution rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on "magic wand" causality where interacting with the object instantly downloads knowledge and solves the plot. The closure is an apotheosis (becoming the keeper) that lacks a felt cost or a logical causal chain leading to the result.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc with a defined closure (Conceptual Repricing) where Marcus abandons traditional repair. However, the discovery of the greenhouse ("behind a collapsed wall") functions as a convenient spatial deus ex machina to facilitate the climax, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a convenient magical object ("distilled intention") to resolve the central conflict, functioning as a deus ex machina that bypasses genuine causality. The closure is thematically resonant but unearned by the scene's action, as the transformation occurs instantly without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean and the causal chain holds under the Situational lens. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the "misaligned" duet, though the resolution feels slightly rushed due to the brevity. The orientation and timeline (waiting for sunrise) serve the tension well.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from physical sensation to conceptual realization to action. Closure lands with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, though the introduction of the child at the end feels slightly utilitarian as a target for the protagonist's new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is functional and linear, moving smoothly from invitation to acquisition, but it reads more like a prologue than a self-contained story with high-stakes closure. The ending opens a door ("Tonight... she would begin") rather than shutting one with the weight of a paid price, leaving the closure feeling preparatory rather than definitive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative builds a solid investigative chain until the climax, which pivots on a "knowledge leap." The protagonist divines complex backstory details (grandmother's specific sabotage methods) instantly from a warm object, bypassing the scene's causal logic and resorting to summary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fable logic holds together well, with the "Great Softening" providing a sturdy frame for the surreal causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the destruction of the library; the cost is absolute, and the transformation of the protagonist into text completes the narrative arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path with a legible closure (Charged Poise). The resolution relies on a somewhat convenient "magical" interaction between the shard and the temporal streams that dissolves the obstacle too quickly, lowering the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution is a classic "deus ex machina" where the villain defeats himself instantly via the magic system's rules, requiring no ingenuity or sacrifice from the protagonist in the moment. The ending offers a "happy ever after" reset without the required on-page cost or consequence to anchor the change.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure—a strategic retreat to prepare—is a legible decision. However, the central mystery of the expedition is resolved via a vision that functions as an expository summary ("they had simply walked through"), which deflates the tension rather than deepening the narrative argument through action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation is solid, anchoring the scene effectively. However, the plot relies entirely on the convenient discovery of a magical object that resolves the inciting incident without tactical effort. The closure is legible (Conceptual Repricing) but feels unearned due to the heavy reliance on coincidence and the lack of obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage of months rather than a grounded scene with immediate pressure, diluting the structural tension. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the postcards as instruction) is logically sound, it lands without a felt price because the "reckoning" happens in abstract time. The piece reads more like a synopsis of an artistic process than a story with urgent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structural loop of the diary triggering the trap and the debris resolving it is coherent and legible. However, the resolution relies on a didactic instruction ("Make the pattern I taught you") rather than a protagonist-driven causal breakthrough, making the closure feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure: Silas arrives, diagnoses, performs a ritual, and succeeds without complication. While the closure (the town’s revival) is legible, the lack of unforeseen consequences or resistance from the magic makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The "cost" of the ritual is described but not dramatized as a significant obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a "Conceptual Repricing" closure where the prophecy recontextualizes Matthias's life work. The loop between the boy's intuition and the man's discovery is satisfying, and the "tower cracking" serves as an effective, confirming escalation beat. The pacing effectively manages the transition from discovery to resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of successful procedural execution without a decisive turn or reversal. The closure fails the cost requirement; the ending is purely additive (restoration) with no visible or felt price paid for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    Causal logic suffers from scientific confusion; describing "deep tectonic shifts" being detected as barometric "pressure changes" conflates seismic and atmospheric science, undermining the premise. The assertion that a bell has more "authority" than a siren in a modern village requires unearned suspension of disbelief. The definition of "zero hour" (no warning possible) is immediately contradicted by the successful warning.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative lens, but the closure arrives as a gift from the universe rather than an earned shift. The protagonist observes a miracle and accepts a new philosophy without facing resistance, a dilemma, or a visible cost, resulting in a soft "Conceptual Repricing" that lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative drive works well, moving from the appearance of the ghosts to the opening of the box and the final realization. The closure (Earned Stasis) is distinct and resonant, with the protagonist accepting a conceptual cost (the weight of silence) that reconfigures her existence. A slight reliance on intuition before evidence in the middle beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of clues leading to a Conceptual Repricing, but the climax relies on a convenient "magical download" of information from the urn rather than active deduction. The realization feels given by the object rather than earned by the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is functional but relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where a loss (broken kite) is instantly converted into a gain (spiritual insight) without sufficient on-page struggle. The resolution bypasses emotional processing, making the closure feel conceptually tidy but dramatically hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight, moving efficiently from the inciting diagnosis to the dawn revelation. The causal link between the predecessor's condition and the architectural requirements turns a potential coincidence into a systemic world-rule (Conceptual Repricing). Closure lands with a powerful Charged Poise, reframing the looming conflict with the trustees.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conceptual repricing closure (humanity as an experiment) is legible and carries conceptual cost, satisfying the Drive Lens (Accumulative). However, the scene is static, functioning primarily as an exposition exchange between two agreeing characters rather than a dramatized turning point with active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative functions well as a cohesive atmospheric vignette or tableau, with excellent orientation and a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the landscape’s meaning is overwritten. However, the linear progression lacks a pivotal turn or structural surprise; the outcome is never in doubt, which limits narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "three nights" journey is summarized rather than dramatized, bypassing the physical stakes of the wasteland. The ending relies on dialogue to explain the mechanics of the sanctuary, which softens the causal impact of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path (problem → realization → magical solution) without sufficient causal resistance; the resolution relies on dream logic that fixes a physical crisis without a felt cost. The closure brings a "soft reset" satisfaction rather than a hard-won reconfiguration of the station's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the antagonist's immediate capitulation dissolves tension too early, making the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and decisive, utilizing the single scene to crystallize a stance against the new government's narrative. The closure is excellent, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina's refusal and return to her "walking" recontextualizes her isolation as a position of power and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the climax relies on spatial and magical convenience: she simply follows a new path to find the perfect "chamber where no books lived" exactly when needed. The causality link between the stone's script and the "memory of seeds" is abstract and metaphorical rather than mechanically earned, making the resolution feel soft and slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is solid with clear orientation and a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The causality of the tapestry mechanics is functional, though the resolution comes somewhat easily, lacking a "dark night" moment before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot is linear and low-resistance, with the climax relying on a "soft reset" where the plan works perfectly without complication. The concept of "acoustic memory" appears late as a convenient solution to ensure victory, and the ending lacks a felt cost, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a strong Causal line where the collapsing workshop forces a final trade-off between life and legacy. Closure is definitive (Earned Stasis) with an undeniable cost paid on the page, though the "voices" of the statue confirming her success slightly soften the isolation of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure depends on a serendipitous "wrong turn" to resolve the central search, violating the principle that coincidence should complicate rather than solve problems. While the final conceptual repricing is legible, the causal path leading to it lacks necessary friction or inevitable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: she climbs, she asks, he returns. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost"; Thomas returning "not fully human" is framed as a victory rather than a price paid, making the ending feel unearned and the causality soft.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from general duty to a specific, high-stakes personal intervention (the brother). Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis; the final image of the scarred bronze foot effectively reconfigures her resignation into active purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the premise. However, finding perfectly preserved truffles in an old tin box is a causality break (perishability logic) and a convenient coincidence that bypasses the foraging challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a brilliant causal linkage between the lighthouse's rotation and the memory gaps. However, the pivotal realization—connecting scratched dates on a dock immediately to the stranger being his son returning stolen memories—is a significant knowledge leap that feels more like an authorial reveal than a deduction earned purely by scene cues. Closure is strong, effectively recontextualizing the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent, using the flood as an effective inciting incident to dislodge the protagonist. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "doorway" sequence relies on a convenient vision to resolve the internal conflict rather than causal pressure forcing a tangible sacrifice in the real world.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive causal line from warning to resolution, establishing a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (queen becomes guardian). The "solution" to the mystery relies heavily on expository dialogue from the setting itself, which slightly flattens the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution relies on a soft causality where a metaphorical realization ("returning differently") instantly solves a physical engineering problem without material cost or trial. The ending feels unearned because the environment adapts to the protagonist's mindset with magical ease, lacking a "felt cost" for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The loop structure effectively mirrors the protagonist's chronological entrapment, and the final image (soaring while documenting) offers a resonant Conceptual Repricing. The physical anchor of the cabin successfully prevents the deliberate timeline confusion from collapsing into disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clock is repaired to "acknowledge interruption"—is conceptually strong. However, the inciting incident relies on convenience (Mara intuitively knowing the screw's origin and the daughter's profession without causal evidence), which weakens the narrative chain.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line where the obstacle (crystallization) becomes the solution, creating a satisfying structural loop. The reliance on a flashback to resolve the central conflict is a standard device that slightly dampens the sense of immediate, earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal arc is tight, driven by Vera's realization and subsequent choice to alter her methods. While the "sudden understanding" of the orchard's metaphysical rules feels slightly expository, the closure—a collaborative requiem—lands effectively with clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative path toward a Conceptual Repricing closure ("Continue"). The structure is sound, and the "hiccup" framing works well, though the resolution relies heavily on external guidance (the book's instructions) rather than protagonist agency driving the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure works well to build atmospheric tension through the countdown. However, the closure relies on a summarized realization ("She realized then that she was the bridge...") rather than dramatizing the shift through action or image alone, which softens the impact of the Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The plot relies on a "magic wand" inciting incident (instant evolution of quantum tunneling) that breaks suspension of disbelief. The resolution is thematic rather than causal, as the external anomaly solves the internal problem without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (writing the message) lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing of the father's addiction. However, the inciting incident (decoding the message) and the climax (stranger appearing instantly to explain it) rely on convenient timing that feels mechanically plotted rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative forms a coherent textural vignette ending in Earned Stasis, but lacks the causal tightening or decisive turn required for higher bands; the loop structure is competent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the handover scene to anchor the heavy backstory of the fire and the three-day wait. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the document's meaning is fundamentally altered by the protagonist's action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative structure is linear and functional, but the closure is severely undercut by a flashforward ("When it rang three weeks later") that summarizes the outcome rather than letting the weight of the trade land in the moment. This explains the resolution instead of trusting the scene's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of accumulation without a causal pivot or moment of doubt; the protagonist simply walks until the revelation occurs. While the closure offers a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of prior complication makes the ending feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the rescue ship's arrival providing effective causal pressure. The resolution—transmitting both coordinates—is a clever "Situational" closure that leverages the established mechanics of observer-dependent reality. The logic holds together well, offering a Decisive Change in stance that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scene follows a clear accumulative logic to a conceptual realization, but the closure lacks immediate on-page cost. The resolution feels like an affirmation of backstory labor rather than a consequence of present struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the arsonist becomes the keeper, but the narrative relies heavily on summarized backstory and convenient exposition (molecular DNA in thread) rather than active, causal scene work. The lack of on-page obstacles makes the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story relies on a "magic feather" resolution where drumming on walls physically hacks a high-tech neural interface without established mechanical logic. While the closure (Decisive Change) is legible, the causal bridge relies on technobabble rather than earned narrative logic. The transition to dream-logic blurs the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the inciting incident—the storm verifying his challenge—transitions smoothly to the resolution. However, the premise of a formal "challenge" with a coin entry fee feels slightly contrived within the gritty setting, and the resolution comes too easily to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    The central mechanism—reflecting starlight via a dental mirror to cast constellations on a dock—is physically implausible and breaks causal immersion. The resolution relies on a "lesson" structure where the protagonist is taught the answer, resulting in a tidy ending devoid of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution relies on a "god from the backstory" mechanism—the synchronized window displays organized off-page—which deflates the immediate narrative tension of the confrontation. The victory feels pre-ordained rather than earned through a high-stakes decision made in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and fable-like, but the resolution relies on magical convenience (the whale call solving the conflict) rather than causal agency. Closure is legible but conceptually tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The pacing is exemplary, using the rhythmic whittling to structure the transfer of knowledge from performer to protagonist. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the method—and its cost—are fully adopted, resolving the scene’s tension with a tangible shift in behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is coherent but linear, lacking a true causal struggle; the ban is lifted before the story starts, removing external opposition. The closure—a successful transformation of the space—arrives without a "visible or felt cost" as required by the rubric. The sequence reads as a procession rather than a plot with resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Over the following weeks") to bypass the necessary dramatization of Enzo's change, stripping the story of its central struggle. The daughter's arrival at the exact moment of completion is a coincidental resolution that feels unearned by the scene's prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a linear path to a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causality is soft; the crowd's arrival acts as an instant reward for the protagonist's change rather than a complication. The closure lacks a "felt cost" or trade-off—Vera gains connection without losing anything significant (e.g., her position, the archive's integrity). The orientation is clear, but the narrative drive is low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, using the stranger's visit to reinforce Elena's internal state. Closure lands as Charged Poise—preparing the needle but deferring the ink—which feels earned. The "curtains of intention" explanation in the middle is a weak causal link, relying on magical thinking rather than dramatized access.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure ("Scooby-Doo" unmasking) without genuine causal pressure or setbacks. The closure is a realization (Conceptual Repricing) that the network is an archive, but this arrives via explanation rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The climax relies on two characters agreeing on an interpretation of data, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight with a clear decisive change at the climax. The specific requirement of a "living filter" for the ritual appears only at the moment of action (just-in-time information), which slightly softens the causal satisfaction, though the absorption mechanic was set up early.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, using the river stone effectively to bridge timelines and ground the "ghost in the machine" premise. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Mira redefines her role to preserve shadows—lands with logical coherence, though the mechanics of shadows moving in static video files strain the sci-fi logic slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Exemplary structure under a Causal lens. The narrative arc from the surgery (action) to the confession (closure) is tight and logical. The ending qualifies as a Decisive Change with visible cost (typing the public confession, accepting ruin), satisfying the closure requirement completely.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, moving from observation to epiphany with a legible Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. However, the resolution relies heavily on the plants explicitly "showing" her the answer, which reduces the causal friction and makes the epiphany feel slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure works well, building density through the specific letters until the decision to intervene. Closure is distinct and active—a resonant reconfiguration where the "trash" is revalued as sacred, with the implied cost of falsifying a professional report.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, ending with a Decisive Change (creativity released, protagonist consumed). However, the climax leans on external force ("thought wasn't quite her own") rather than protagonist will, weakening the causal chain. The "ancient astronomers" logic is delivered as summary rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the final image is resonant, effectively using the "frozen clock" motif. However, the climax relies on a soft reset—singing louder to banish the antagonist—which resolves the conflict without a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic key" resolution where inserting the gear instantly solves the central mystery without cost or complication. The backstory of the "Great Dampening" appears late to explain the stakes, and the ending offers a convenient, symmetrical satisfaction rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear before/after state. However, the causality relies heavily on dream logic and convenient ferry-guide omniscience rather than character agency driving the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure effectively braids the backstory of the "incident" with the present-day arrival, using the bolt as a tangible causal link. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "unpardonable silence" is alchemized into a new form of expression. The flashback block is substantial but necessary, anchoring the stakes of the reunion without stalling momentum. The ending lands with clear, felt cost (the years lost, the surgeries).

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where the conflict dissolves instantly upon the use of a prepared item (the ink pellet). The protagonist pays no visible or felt cost for this victory, making the closure read as a mechanical reset rather than an earned change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is a strong Decisive Change (lowering the station to dive) that follows the Accumulative lens of the "symphony." The logic holds, though the expository paragraph explaining the "revelation" slows the momentum right before the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where vintage glasses and walking a circle magically fix a broken engine, lacking causal teeth or material cost. While the "lull" is established, the resolution (reignition) arrives without a test of the protagonist's agency or sacrifice, resulting in a low-stakes ritual rather than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot relies on significant contrivances, notably the "algae vision" leading to a kite that conveniently holds a complex chemical formula. The resolution is a "magic button" ending: the release of the spores instantly neutralizes the threat without extracting a visible price or complicating the outcome, failing the cost requirement for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the beacon sweeping "the living and the dead" crystallizes the dual reality of violence and growth. The "Earned Stasis" is felt as a tangible cost through the dirt under her fingernails.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situation/Concept lens where physical pressure forces a perceptual shift (Conceptual Repricing). Closure lands effectively; the reinterpretation of the crushing walls as an "embrace" creates a valid, resonant resolution to the established surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is coherent and logically structured, but the closure relies on a realization granted by the environment rather than earned through a decisive action or paid cost. The ending feels like a successful experiment with no stakes attached, resulting in a low-impact conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is strong, moving linearly from the letter's arrival to the irreversible upload. The mechanism of the "cascade failure" in the cooling system creates a satisfying, logical closure that ensures the outcome despite her imminent arrest. The orientation is immediate and stable, though the prompt-mandated phrases occasionally disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.6)
    The scene follows a linear "arrival and acceptance" arc but lacks causal tension; the resolution feels pre-ordained rather than earned by the beat's pressure. Closure is a "soft reset" where the father’s violence is washed away by the mood, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to make the ending land.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from setup to encounter to resolution with clear causality (spike/silence leads to catch). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the climax ("not a struggle but a dance") resolves the tension too smoothly, lacking the friction or stumble that creates a deeper narrative grip.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "Tokyo" solution is a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the conflict, shifting the goal from "winning" to "confusing." The epiphany regarding the father's proxy relies on a poetic leap (star light arrival) rather than strict evidentiary logic, which slightly weakens the causal chain, but the strategic closure lands with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, moving from arrival to resolution without unexpected obstacles or reversals. The "letters from the future" device creates a deterministic loop that drains tension, as the protagonist's success feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc relies on a "deus ex machina" logic where a falling tile flake explicitly delivers the thematic resolution ("The mess is the meaning"). This undermines the inciting tension of the "unlearning," as the conflict is resolved by a sudden download of understanding rather than causal progression or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational arc, moving from a loop of guilt to a moment of release. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from restorer to creator). The reliance on the magic system to literally spell out the protagonist's identity ("Gentle Radical") acts as a convenient shortcut for the turning point, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story fails the closure requirement for visible or felt cost; the resolution creates a perfect "happy ending" where the protagonist gains his lost love and his applause with no sacrifice or consequence. The plot relies on a "magic key" ex machina that resolves the central conflict instantly upon use, bypassing causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear demonstration structure ("show and tell") rather than a causal arc with complications. Closure is a pure victory state where the protagonist is validated without paying any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the early reliance on expository backstory slows momentum. The ending lands cleanly with the crumbling fossil, but the lack of causal obstacles makes the journey feel more like a tour than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative moves linearly without causal pressure or obstacles; the climax is a procedural ritual that succeeds instantly, and the closure—a conceptual upgrade—lacks a legible cost or trade-off to ground the change.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "snow codes" mechanism strains plausibility significantly; the physics of refrozen Cyrillic letters on a cliff face disrupts the grounded tone. Additionally, the "it was all a deep cover plan" reveal acts as a convenient reset that resolves the central conflict without requiring the protagonist to pay a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative acts as a linear vignette without causal complications; the resolution functions as a "soft reset" of the woman's trauma, dissolving her burden without a dramatized cost or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a Situational drive where the protagonist arrives, observes, and leaves, resulting in a legible Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the plot relies on convenient timing (the smoke signal) and expository realization rather than active problem-solving or causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully executing a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the tool is left behind to mark a transition. The inciting incident (petal drop) clearly motivates the trip to the harbor, though the lack of obstacles makes the trajectory feel linear and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative functions as a coherent vignette with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, but the arc lacks resistance; the realization arrives smoothly without a "because/therefore" struggle or visible cost. The logic of the "impossible" sundial is waved away as paradox, which weakens the causal grounding of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scene follows a clean Accumulative arc, layering the installation's construction with the thematic revelation. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing (individual love is actually universal), which is legible, but the "cost" of this realization feels minimal on the page; the reconciliation is smooth and symmetric rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a "magic wand" mechanic where counter-frequencies conveniently clear the faculty's minds, bypassing the need for persuasive agency or dramatic confrontation. Much of the conflict (the debates, the AI's origin) is delivered via summary rather than dramatized scenes, leading to an ending that explains the plot rather than resolving it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, following a clear descent-discovery-ascent structure with legible closure. The causality wavers in the middle; the protagonist ceases to solve problems and instead simply follows the music, which acts as a convenient guide, reducing agency. The ending lands a solid conceptual change, but the "how" of the spatial shift relies on dream logic rather than established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, but the causal chain breaks at the deduction; the leap from the number of portraits to the specific timeframe ("seventeen months ago") lacks on-page evidence. Closure serves as a solution to the puzzle but lacks a visceral personal cost beyond physical fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear causal chain linking the artifact (nail) to the revelation (islands). The pacing accelerates effectively with the storm. The coincidence of the ships arriving exactly at the moment of decoding is convenient, but the closure—choosing to broadcast amidst the evacuation—lands with tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on an unearned epiphany ("suddenly she understood") to connect the scaffold wraps to the musical notation, bypassing causal investigation. While the closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, the mechanism leading to it feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative spans several seasons using a summary/montage structure ("As autumn deepened," "The winter brought") rather than a continuous scene, which dilutes immediate tension. While the closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing for the antagonist, the lack of dramatized scene pressure violates the short-story scope expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from discovery to realization and acceptance. The inciting incident (finding the telegram) works well, though relying on a 43-year-old message surfacing "now" is a convenient trigger. Closure is legible as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, satisfying the prompt's structural requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear causal arc with a strong closure unit that reconfigures the protagonist's stance. However, the pivotal realization relies on a dense block of expository summary in the middle ("His ancestor hadn't betrayed...") rather than dramatized discovery, which drags the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative is linear and low-resistance: instruction received, task performed, victory achieved. While the "scars" logic is established, the climax (planting the seed and signing the covenant) proceeds without obstruction or complication, lacking the requisite "decisive change" with felt cost. The closure is tidy and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is solid, and the recontextualization of the burned card provides a satisfying structural pivot. The resolution, however, feels slightly soft; the "cost" of binding fate is immediately reframed as a "gift" and "expansion," resolving the central grief with a magical fix rather than a lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot hinges on a contrivance that breaks causal believability: finding the exact scrap of cloth from his specific past tour in a random box is a "miracle" solution. This coincidence resolves the central mystery too easily, bypassing the need for the protagonist to confront his uncertainty with genuine risk, leading to a convenient rather than inevitable closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is functional, transitioning from backstory summary to the climactic moment, but the heavy reliance on exposition in the first half delays immersion. Closure is legible and decisive (consuming the seed), and the cost (loss of individual self/quiet life) is clear. However, the inciting mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing the narrative engine to a linear sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment that moves smoothly from arrival to departure, but it lacks a causal pivot where the outcome is in doubt. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the "smelting" process feels like a soft-magic convenience that resolves the visitor's crisis without a visible, hard-fought cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with strong on-page closure (the decision to falsify the report and reach out). The causal link between the etching and the "eruption of light" is magical/fable-logic, which works within the premise but simplifies the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative relies on a significant contrivance: the bathroom graffiti containing a map explicitly labeled with "the accident." This specific detail aligns too perfectly with Marcus's unique trauma, straining plausibility and acting as a deus ex machina to force the resolution. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the trigger undermines the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "Just So" dream logic where the rules are explained rather than tested, leading to a circular closure that resets the frame without a felt price. The ending offers a "symmetric satisfaction" (she succeeds because she is the chosen keeper) rather than a resolution earned through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The closure is decisive and the cost (loss of the academic empire) is paid on the page. However, the resolution relies heavily on the artifact's inherent magical justice mechanism acting as a convenient trap, rather than protagonist ingenuity alone driving the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story relies on a Deus Ex Machina resolution: the chip "sings" and the patterns "suddenly align" to reveal the secret without Mira actively solving the puzzle on the page. This "knowledge leap" undercuts her agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative lacks genuine causality or narrative drive; the story operates as a static vignette where a character goes to a place and is told the moral by a spirit. The closure relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where dialogue resolves the central tension without the protagonist paying a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drive is clear under a Situational/Causal hybrid lens, moving efficiently from the client's defense to the dismantling of his illusion. Closure lands effectively with a Conceptual Repricing—Marcus is left not with absolution, but with the burden of complexity—though the "burning questions" beat feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vignette structure functions effectively as a "lesson" arc with clear orientation and coherent conceptual progression. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing—redefining "vanishing" as "presence"—that lands cleanly, though the scope limits the complexity of the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative loop is coherent, and the closure (the pulse revealing itself as her own past voice) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the stakes are low; the "cost" of her 300-year vigil is established as a sunk cost in backstory, leaving the on-page climax without a palpable price or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, anchoring the inciting incident (stepping out) to the resolution (revaluing magic). However, the ending relies heavily on an "explain-everything" summary to deliver closure, rather than letting the scene’s action carry the weight. The orientation is solid, but the ease of the climax reduces the impact of the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on the "convenient manual" trope; finding a journal that explicitly explains the magic system and the protagonist's condition dissolves the central mystery without earned effort. The pacing is rushed, moving from discovery to mastery in a few paragraphs. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is technically present, it feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or failures.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circular structure effectively mirrors the "backwards prophecy" concept, and the closure lands a clear Conceptual Repricing of her role. However, the narrative lacks a pivotal "turn" or deviation; the outcome feels inevitable from the first paragraph, making the causality feel linear despite the time-loop premise.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the mechanism of "crystallized light" appears conveniently at the climax without prior establishment, acting as a slight deus ex machina to facilitate the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path, but the climax lacks resistance; the ritual works exactly as theorized on the first try. The ending offers vindication without a visible or felt cost on the page, weakening the sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    The climax relies on a significant logic break: a loose paper photograph and handwritten ink surviving forty years of submersion and currents behind a bottle in a broken-windowed building. This "physics amnesia" undermines the story's realism for the sake of a convenient plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the pivotal epiphany—where bird patterns instantly clarify a complex formula—relies on coincidence rather than causal agency. Closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of the crystal, but the setup feels mechanically eased.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scene is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident (the call) and closure (the lie), but causality suffers from the weak authentication of the antagonist/ally. The narrative relies on a "trust the voice" trope that bypasses the necessary pressure of verifying the caller's allegiance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is tight and efficient, using the sparring match to externalize the internal conflict. The closure is a decisive change (accepting the "third path") that resolves the central tension with a clear conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure relies on a montage ("Mira returned nightly") that dissipates the tension of the opening scene, smoothing over the conflict duration. The resolution is achieved through magical convenience (the "misdirection" field) rather than protagonist ingenuity or sacrifice, weakening the causal chain. Closure creates a conceptual shift but lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where a magical intervention instantly resolves deep grief without complication or consequence. The closure relies on symmetric satisfaction—the ritual simply works—lacking the necessary causal resistance, complication, or "felt cost" to make the emotional resolution earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is excellent, and the closure (leaving the post) creates a legible decisive change. The resolution, however, relies on convenient plotting—the Codex arbitrarily allowing "two" passengers dissolves the logistical cost of the exit without forcing a difficult tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative compresses the escalation into a summary of twenty-three attempts, robbing the climax of earned weight. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the path to it relies on montage rather than a causal chain of specific, high-stakes tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure (shifting from commerce to teaching) lands with the legible cost of the burnt-out fragment. The structure effectively supports the Accumulative lens, though the lack of setbacks makes the progression feel somewhat linear and low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is legible, but the inciting incident ("Tonight felt different") lacks causal weight. The climax relies on a sudden, unearned magical capacity (the hourglass's readiness) rather than a pressure-cooked decision, resulting in a low-stakes "soft reset" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and follows a linear progression from weaving to transformation to exit. However, the trajectory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle; the lack of significant obstacles or causal turns flattens the sense of achievement at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative forms an expository vignette rather than a causal arc; the progression is linear demonstration without setbacks or doubt. Closure relies on a "Conceptual Repricing" of the universe, but because the mastery is achieved in summary without on-page cost, the ending feels intellectual rather than earned. The structure lacks a pivot point where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ending violates causality by asserting a total resolution ("seventeen hearts remembered") while the protagonist is merely running toward the antagonist, skipping the actual confrontation or mechanism of rescue. This "mission accomplished" summary disconnects the outcome from the on-page action, failing the requirement for a dramatized closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation and the descent arc are handled well, but the climax relies on a convenient mechanism (ghostly text written in water) to deliver the core mystery solution. This "magical" exposition bypasses the protagonist's investigative agency, weakening the causal chain of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    The closure is legible as a conceptual acceptance of dual nature, but the central mechanism—dipping a porcelain shard in ink to control digital servers—lacks causal grounding. The story straddles sci-fi (server glitches, death certificates) and high fantasy (ink spells) without reconciling the logic, making the interface feel like a convenient magic wand rather than a taught system.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a convenient geometric coincidence (bird gap matching the diamond crack) that resolves the central puzzle too easily. Additionally, the closure—her transformation into the landscape—is delivered via a "Years later" epilogue rather than dramatized as an immediate, on-page consequence of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure (Marina joining the returned) is a decisive change, but the path there relies on a "sudden understanding" that explains the mystery without sufficient on-page causality. This "explain-everything" realization deflates the narrative tension by resolving the central conflict through a convenient intellectual leap.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean, causal trajectory from the initial note to the orchard's awakening. The structure is tight, utilizing the "gap" timeframe effectively to launch the climax. Closure is achieved through a mix of Decisive Change (the awakening) and Charged Poise (the pending arrival of enforcement), leaving the cost felt and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear errand (arrival, wait, transaction, departure) that lacks a causal turn or decisive change. The ending offers "Symmetric Satisfaction"—a tidy resolution where every thread is tied off without cost or consequence. The absences in the manifest are a convenient plot device that smooths the path rather than generating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a low-agency coincidence (stumbling left instead of right) to solve the central problem, which weakens the causal chain. The introduction of the "time soften" rule to enable the transition feels convenient, and the resolution comes without a visible or felt cost—Emil gains everything and sacrifices nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing (stories live everywhere), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the progression lacks causal tightness or high-stakes turning points, relying on a "tour" of the magic system rather than a pressure-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is robust; the magic system is taught efficiently and pays off in a decisive renunciation. The structure manages the backstory and present action well, delivering a clear closure unit where the protagonist alters her path.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where a metaphysical problem is solved by vague methods ("whispered truths," "gentle untangling") rather than concrete causal tactics. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned, as the "web of fears" offers no active resistance that forces the protagonist to adapt or sacrifice. The closure is a "soft reset" of reality without a tangible on-page price beyond superficial physical damage.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to a distinct resonant reconfiguration where Margaret shifts from seeker to keeper. The causal link between the broken constellations and the memory loss is a strong structural logic that pays off. Closure is solid, with the conceptual cost of carrying the "heavy" histories legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Charged Poise" closure—preparing for the long task ahead—lands effectively. The central causal link, however, relies on a convenient magical correspondence (tea leaves aligning with the shadow) that appears just in time to resolve the conflict, feeling more like a prompt solution than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story follows a linear procedural structure without reversals, unexpected obstacles, or cost. The planting is a foregone conclusion, and the closure—a simple success without sacrifice—lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure, building through the restoration process to a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration. While the closure works conceptually (net transformed to mending), the lack of on-page obstacles or distinct causal turns limits the narrative drive and felt cost to a procedural level.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, moving logically from artifact analysis to conceptual synthesis. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the chapel's purpose—lands clearly and justifies the protagonist's final decision. The causal link between the skin oils and the specific coordinates feels slightly convenient but fits the genre's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clear with strong orientation and a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure. While the physics are hand-waved ("impossibly," "quirk") to allow the premise, the magical realist frame holds sufficient logic to support the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of preparation and execution without deviation or setbacks. While the closure establishes the desired connection, it arrives too easily, lacking the "felt cost" or decisive change in the status quo required for higher tension; the resolution feels guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floor-by-floor ascent provides a solid structural spine, but the central puzzle resolves with minimal resistance; the coordinates appear simply by looking. The closure relies on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of her worldview, but it lacks a felt cost or sacrifice—she gains wisdom without paying a price, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, building pressure through observation toward a distinct Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is effective, recontextualizing the "memory" theory with a new understanding of the cycle, though the external stakes (ground control) remain distant background noise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves thematic closure, but relies on a convenient backstory discovery ("She'd already discovered") that lowers present-action tension. The plot functions as a linear procedural toward a known goal rather than a causal chain of escalating choices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear puzzle-solving track (Accumulative/Discovery), but the inciting logic relies heavily on convenience—specifically finding the key phrasebook "wedged behind the hopscotch board." The closure brings a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the connection between bird flight and a floor game feels more like a contrived coincidence than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a functional causal chain (find scraps → assemble gears → realization) that leads to valid Conceptual Repricing closure. The progression is linear and convenient, lacking unexpected obstacles or twists that would test the protagonist's agency beyond following instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece relies entirely on summary and montage ("By the third morning," "Slowly, cautiously," "six months later") rather than a continuous scene, violating scope defaults. The resolution is unearned by narrative struggle; the scientist solves the central problem instantly upon receiving samples, removing causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the nature of the "ending" is redefined. However, the causality relies heavily on the "magic object" trope—the puppet head instantly downloads the solution—rather than an earned narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is tightly constructed around the inciting incident of the travelers' arrival and the looming frost. The "lie" about the shelter turning out to be a prepared truth effectively subverts the expected tragedy. Closure is resonant, utilizing Earned Stasis where the protagonist chooses to remain for a greater purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal causality of the epiphany is strong, but the external resolution relies on a convenient coincidence. Elena's immediate reply revealing she is also working on a "polymer" project resolves the conflict with symmetric satisfaction, removing the risk and cost of Marina's gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is flawless; the child's request forces a specific, high-stakes procedure that logically results in the shop's conceptual repricing. The closure—transforming from a shop of endings to one of beginnings—lands with thematic precision and tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution; the protagonist simply absorbs the antagonist force (the accumulated remorse) and converts it to peace without a lasting, visible cost. The causal link between her cooking skills and the ability to psychically cleanse a fortress is tenuous, relying on a convenient match between a spiral formation and a cookbook recipe. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction rather than an earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on a "magic fix" resolution where deep social problems are solved instantly by a single action without complication. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction with no visible or felt cost, bypassing the "Closure" requirement for a price paid. Causality is dream-logic rather than narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, moving from observation to injection to revelation. While the sequence is logical, the lack of obstacles flattens the arc; the closure (becoming a "bridge") is a clear Conceptual Repricing, but without prior friction or risk of failure, the arrival feels inevitable rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal, moving efficiently from discovery to expedition to resolution. The drive lens is clear. However, the climax relies on a passive information download (touching the node) rather than an active choice-driven turning point. The resolution works well as an "Earned Stasis," locking Orin into the archivists' role.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and procedural, lacking a "tightening" phase where options narrow or risks escalate. The closure ("The hedgehog... seemed to smile") is a soft landing that offers symmetric satisfaction without a felt cost or decisive change. Causality is present, but the lack of obstacles makes the plot feel like a demonstration rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a legible decisive change (renouncing the return) that reconfigures the protagonist's status. Orientation and backstory integration are handled well. However, the scene lacks causal tension; the chess match demonstrates a conclusion already reached rather than forcing the decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident and climax are clearly defined within the single scene. The "magical" solution (opening a mechanical lock with radio frequencies) relies on poetic logic that is accepted rather than earned by causal pressure, but the closure lands firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story functions as a compressed chronicle spanning months rather than a scene-driven narrative, violating the short-story scope default without establishing a Mosaic pattern. The climax is an internal realization described in summary ("at the turning of the tide's thought") rather than an enacted event, diffusing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the climax relies on a convenient "insert key, receive wisdom" mechanic rather than a hard choice. The resolution is an unearned epiphany downloaded from the monument, lacking a decisive change driven by the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path from investigation to action, but the logistical leap of installing a perimeter monitoring system alone in a single afternoon strains credibility. The closure—redefining the accident as emergence—works well conceptually, though the transition from observation to the solution feels rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a "magic button" resolution where the protagonist executes a plan without complication and the world is instantly fixed. The ending lacks a felt cost; the Council's defeat ("signatures erased," "meters shattered") is a convenient, unearned Deus Ex Machina that dissolves the conflict rather than resolving it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of uncomplicated success with no active resistance; the solution is known before the protagonist descends. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the boundary) is legible, it fails the cost proof test, as the protagonist pays no price and faces no risk of failure during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear accumulative arc fueled by the dying stars, leading to a legitimate Conceptual Repricing closure where the nature of emotion is redefined. The transition from "mathematics" to "typography" provides a satisfying intellectual click, though the causal trigger for this specific epiphany feels slightly convenient ("sudden clarity") rather than forced by an unavoidable pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, coherent path, but the causality hinges on a "destiny" logic where A leads to B via technobabble (sympathetic vibration) rather than character action. The closure is legible—a shift from courier to "living bridge"—but feels unearned because the pivotal turn relies on the convenient utility of her static flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear success anecdote lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost; the conflict resolves via a "magic bullet" (the photo) that promises to solve her professional struggles instantly. The premise that a phone photo of frost would rewrite physics textbooks strains credibility and feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story delivers strong on-page closure with a decisive change and visible cost. However, the causal bridge between finding the bead and understanding the complex magic system ("Mei understood now...") relies on an expository knowledge leap rather than dramatized discovery, weakening the narrative drive in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and circular, fitting the fable mode, but lacks causal friction; the magic system solves the problem without complication. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing (the weapon becomes a healing tool), but the ease of the transformation lowers the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    The closure relies on a soft reset that undermines the story's gravity; the solution ("map the repairs") is too convenient, bypassing the established cost of the magic system. By resolving a multiverse-ending threat with a single line of dialogue, the ending lacks the necessary conceptual or emotional price for a story of this caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.6)
    The climax relies on a soft magic system ("intention, not oil") that resolves the problem instantly without cost or failure. The revelation that the ghosts snuffed the light to recruit her undercuts the "danger" stakes, yet this manipulation is never addressed by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "symmetric satisfaction" of resolving all three ships' problems perfectly creates a low-stakes ending. The resolution relies on an instant realization ("understanding finally") rather than a causal chain of difficult choices, and there is no visible cost paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure follows a linear "guru on the mountain" archetype where the protagonist arrives, receives exposition, and achieves enlightenment. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is clear, the narrative relies heavily on dialogue to explain the stakes and solution. The lack of an active obstacle or reversal within the scene itself keeps the tension relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situation/Accumulative path, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing (maintenance as transformation). However, the pivot from decoding grief to projecting tree shadows relies on a poetic leap rather than strict causality, and the "pin drop" moment acts more as a pause button than a pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens, but the progression lacks causal friction; the solution (singing) works immediately once attempted, and the "others" arrive exactly when needed without established proximity. The closure lands a valid Conceptual Repricing (daily effort replacing cosmic certainty), but the lack of setbacks or complications in the rising action flattens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the "mistake"—lands effectively. The backstory about the invitation is integrated well enough to serve the ending, though the causality is somewhat soft and reliant on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions as a linear guided tour with low causal pressure; the protagonist observes rather than decides until the final acceptance. Closure lands on a valid resonant reconfiguration, but the lack of obstacles makes the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, with the falling library providing an effective ticking clock. The discovery of the founder’s slide relies slightly on coincidence to resolve the thematic arc, but the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of loss into a new beginning—lands with genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative drive is clear, but the climax suffers from a plausibility gap when the antagonist allows Mae to stay and record after discovering she is a federal agent. The resolution ("arrest happened in near silence... market had already dissolved") is causally muddy regarding the fate of the shipment, weakening the external closure despite the strong internal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a clear realization, but the "forest election" subplot runs parallel without causally intersecting Marina's choices until the exposition-heavy end. Closure is distinct but lacks earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is coherent and circular, with a clear inciting incident and climax, but the resolution relies on a convenient message to solve the central tension instantly. The causality is linear and lacks a moment of genuine doubt or deviation; the path from entry to epiphany is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the inciting discovery to a decisive act of rebellion. The leap from a physical zinc plate to understanding the acoustic properties of ventilation tubes is a slight logical stretch but fits the fable-like tone. Closure is strong, offering a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.4)
    The reliance on a dream to provide the technical solution ("she had understood") is a convenience that bypasses causal problem-solving. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the plan works perfectly on the first try with no unforeseen complications or acute costs beyond the inevitable melting of the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an Accumulative lens, moving from static pressure to the release of the burn. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the android accepts its "fragmented wholeness"—lands with conceptual clarity. The logic of the fears functioning as fuel is established early, allowing the magical realism to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a significant convenience ("mission control" sequence) where neighbors easily bypass privacy laws to retrieve 17 lost letters in an afternoon. This montage resolves the central obstacle off-page without cost or credible causality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible accumulative structure, moving from entry to dance to solution. The "unweaving" sequence provides a solid beat of reversal/mastery. However, the "Welcome home" closure offers a safe, low-cost resolution that resolves the mystery without extracting a significant price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief is reclaimed—is poignant and earned by the protagonist's choice. The score is limited by the expository "download" in the climax, where the mystery is solved by a sudden intuition about the founders rather than a causal on-page discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving cleanly from the inciting ritual to a resonant closure. The "Earned Stasis" ending, where the prophecy is dissolved rather than fulfilled, lands with clear conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc creates a clean, linear path to closure with the shift from implicit ritual to explicit instruction. While the "Resonant Reconfiguration" lands with the decision to teach him, the "cost" is relatively low—primarily the shedding of a social pretense—making the ending feel safe rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with minimal obstruction; Marina goes to the garden, digs, and finds the object without facing an antagonist or significant complication. The climax relies on convenience ("found it just as the last star faded"), and the resolution offers symmetric satisfaction without a distinct, earned cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers a significant causality break at closure. The premise establishes a tyrannical Emperor who executes on suspicion; the conclusion that a confession of twenty years of high treason would "free her brother" and allow Mei to "walk free" contradicts the political stakes. The magical appearance of the grandmother's text acts as a Deus Ex Machina to resolve the internal conflict, bypassing earned narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is complete with a legible Decisive Change closure. However, the rising action relies heavily on the shell functioning as an exposition device that delivers answers without protagonist effort, reducing the causal density of the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "fetch quest" logic (collect 12 globes) that undercuts the story's self-containment. The pivotal revelation—that a chemical formula is encoded in the arrangement of melted plastic buildings—strains causality and reads as a convenient magical leap rather than an earned plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is a legible accumulative vignette with clear orientation and a coherent sequence of events. However, the closure relies on a soft reaffirmation of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible price paid on the page. The narrative moves from A to B smoothly, but the lack of causal friction or an inciting perturbation makes the trajectory feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central mechanism of discovery—shredded documents buried in a waterproof box rather than destroyed—strains plausibility; it contradicts the urgent order to &quot;destroy all evidence&quot; merely to provide a puzzle for the protagonist. Despite this contrivance, the closure is decisive, logically derived from the setup, and lands with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building pressure through the storm to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. While the arc is solid, the causal path is low-resistance; the protagonist succeeds without a significant setback or twist, making the resolution feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on convenient coincidence (finding the exact owner immediately) and heavy summary to bypass obstacles. The resolution is unearned by the scene, utilizing a "weeks later" epilogue to introduce a documentary filmmaker and fame, effectively dissolving stakes with a "happily ever after" recap.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative drive is clear and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the signal—lands with visible cost. The timing of the antagonists' arrival (bursting in exactly at the moment of completion) is a standard thriller convenience that slightly softens the Causal lens. The logic of the ritual is handled well within the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a pre-established plan that proceeds without complication or snag. While the orientation and causal logic of the magic system are excellent, the lack of unforeseen variables or friction creates a flat structural arc. Closure is a distinct Decisive Change, but the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands with a decisive resignation, but the causal chain relies heavily on a deus ex machina prop that provides all necessary information and motivation in a single beat. Orientation is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear shift in Eliza's perspective. However, the pathetic fallacy of the storm clearing exactly as the music box is fixed feels contrived, slightly softening the earned causality of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path from curiosity to apotheosis without a decisive turn that imposes a cost; the climax resolves via a sudden immunity to the acid sea, reducing the tension. The closure offers a "super-success" outcome where the protagonist gains everything (flight, transcendence, leadership) without paying a visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story breaks its own genre rules, leaping from grounded data forensics to magical biological digitization without setup; the causal link between an astronaut in space and a social network's deletion algorithm is incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is a coherent fable with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira recontextualizes her shadows. However, the narrative relies heavily on the off-screen merchant’s backstory to generate weight, rather than generating active causal pressure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, building pressure through the ice calving to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marlene accepts her limbo state. The backstory is heavy but integrates well to justify the present action, and the "folding" of patience serves as a strong causal link for her decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on flashback to generate weight, leaving the present timeline thin on causality until a coincidental arrival resolves the arc. The closure (accepting the daughter) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but it feels unearned in the immediate scene because the daughter's arrival is a convenience that bypasses the need for Marcus to make a proactive choice about his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path: receiving instructions, moving to a location, and executing a task without complication. While the causality is clear, the lack of a meaningful reversal or obstacle makes the arc flat. The ending relies on a successful completion of duties rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the protagonist's status.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with convenient causality; the "treasure hunt" mechanism works instantly without friction or error. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but it lacks cost—the town council's threat is mentioned but never exerts on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from reflection to a resonant closure (Charged Poise) that effectively reconfigures the power dynamic. The climax lands clearly with the use of the crystal. A slight orientation delay occurs regarding the Committee's specific threat, but the timeline and setting are anchored well.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative loop (prophecy–forgetting–fulfillment) is structurally sound, but the climax relies on "magical" convenience where tuning broken TVs effortlessly retrieves audio from a handheld tape reel or the ether. The lack of a concrete causal mechanism for the resolution flattens the dramatic arc into a linear sequence of events without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with excellent orientation and a legible drive lens (Causal/Fabulist hybrid). The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "magical fix" where the clock rewinds and heals the physical damage feels slightly convenient. The cost (staying forever) is conceptual but softened by the character's immediate acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure relies on a summary montage ("Over the following weeks") to bridge the gap between diagnosis and climax, dissipating immediate scene tension. While the closure is legible and resonant, the narrative arc lacks the causal friction of a struggle against obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight, moving logically from observation to hypothesis to action. The closure—a Decisive Change in role and worldview—lands effectively, with the "Spoon Convergence" providing a distinct, coherent backdrop that pays off in the mechanics of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scene functions well as a quiet resonant reconfiguration, and the return of the tooth provides a clear closure beat. The drive is Situational, yet the "Council" threat is introduced but unconnected to the scene's immediate pressure, leaving the stakes feeling retrospective rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the problem is solved by a sudden magical activation ("sea glass began to glow") rather than driven causality. The ending is overly tidy ("Teach us"), resolving the conflict without a felt price or complication, which flattens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the single-scene structure is efficient, moving clearly from solitude to connection. However, the resolution feels unearned due to the lack of friction; Marcus's immediate pivot from apology to "Teach me?" creates a frictionless, fable-like progression that lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.6)
    The vignette structure is coherent, and the closure (releasing the characters) provides a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the pivot relies on a sudden, convenient epiphany ("She'd been writing it backward") triggered by the setting rather than earned through a pressure-cooker choice. The causality is dream-logic, which fits the genre but lowers the sense of inevitable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "magic fix" trajectory where the solution (humming) works immediately without complication or adaptation. The closure lacks a felt cost; the vine yields instantly, and the villagers accept the change without friction, robbing the climax of earned resonance. The causality is soft, relying on convenient, dormant magic rather than character agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure that, while executed with clarity, lacks a significant reversal or complication. The drive lens is Accumulative, successfully building texture toward the final image, but the absence of unexpected obstacles flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the broken state is revalued. The "future echo" provides a neat, circular causality that fits the premise, though the resolution leans heavily on internal realization rather than external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative lens holds; the progression from the grandmother’s specific weight to the grotto’s collective mass builds satisfying pressure. The "warming" burner offers a resonant, magical closing image that physicalizes the memory, validating the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The real-time constraint of the kettle provides a strong structural spine that effectively paces the internal reflection within the word count. Closure is resonant, utilizing the finished carving as a concrete symbol of her shifted perspective ("moving with") that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from the inciting incident (carousel stopping) to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The logic of "narrative time" provides a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the world's mechanics, justifying why the ride restarts only after the story is acknowledged. The causality is internal but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on "magical engineering" where a sextant piece inexplicably solves hydraulic physics, creating a "black box" resolution that breaks causal logic. The inciting find is a convenient coincidence (the carnival unearthed it), and the closure is a symmetric success state without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    The scene is structurally sound with clear orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure (bearing both worlds). The resolution feels slightly additive—simply accepting both roles—which dilutes the sense of "felt cost" required for higher bands, though the conceptual endurance is valid.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is sound, utilizing the sundial effectively to bridge the historical and personal narratives. The closure (Decisive Change) is earned, though the reliance on reflective exposition regarding Van der Meer creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of accumulation (decoding) without significant causal complications or setbacks. Closure relies on a plan for future off-page action (teaching the granddaughter) rather than an immediate, costly reconfiguration of the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds a mood of resignation, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly. However, the orientation and movement rely heavily on internal monologue rather than dramatized interaction, creating a slightly static narrative shape.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid, delivering a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the flawed result. However, the montage bridging the incubation ("Days blurred into nights") glosses over the crucial rising action, reducing the textural weight of the wait.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on backstory and exposition to generate weight, with the present-timeline action limited to a low-stakes ritual. While the "Accumulative" lens is consistent, the closure (a shift in internal perspective) feels pre-ordained rather than earned through scene pressure or unexpected discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path of arrival, ritual, and resolution, and orientation is established quickly. However, the causality is weak; the ritual succeeds simply because the protagonist arrives, with the potential obstacle ("You're early") immediately waived without consequence. The closure relies on a "magic key" solution that resolves the situation without exacting a price or twisting the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is a vignette or loop rather than a causal story; events proceed sequentially (observation, transit, observation) without rising action or complication. Closure relies on a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply accepts her state ("smiled... made peace"), which lacks the requisite visible or felt cost for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—balancing death with birth—rather than narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, braiding the carving progress with the migration season effectively. However, the discovery of the poem at the end relies on shaky causality: it is unclear why Martha would unroll the entire ribbon (a 30-year-old heirloom) specifically on this night after merely using it as a visual reference for weeks. This unearned reveal weakens the closure’s logical footing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative suffers from a "soft reset" resolution where speaking names magically repairs physical brass gears and tensioned springs. This breaks causality; the mechanism of the fix is purely metaphorical, yet it yields a concrete mechanical result, making the closure feel unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc to a resonant closure (stopping the clock, burying the relic). The causal link in the climax—translating thread colors directly into specific biographies—relies on fable logic that feels slightly rushed and unearned within the short word count.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "plan-execution-success" path with no deviation or complication; the resolution relies on the magical efficacy of the maps rather than dramatized interaction. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" (see Q2 Cost proof test)—Mira simply wins and feels satisfied, rendering the victory weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on a predictive summary at the end ("Audience members would breathe...") which resolves the tension via exposition rather than leaving the charged potential of the delivered scores to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from creation to destruction effectively. However, the closure relies on a somewhat convenient lack of police curiosity ("Natural causes"), which softens the causal stakes. The "vanishing" resolves conceptually, but the procedural logic at the climax feels slightly porous.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, moving from confrontation to alignment with clear causality. Closure is achieved through a decisive change in Marcus's stance (accepting the journal), which feels earned. The "enemies to allies" beat lands cleanly within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure collapses at the climax; the pivotal moment of discovering the lost modes is summarized ("By evening, they had found all five modes") rather than dramatized. While the closure of passing the rosette is resonant, the arrival of the students feels convenient, and the resolution comes too easily to earn the weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot relies on a linear ritual rather than causal struggle; the celestial alignment functions as a convenient accelerator ("months... into minutes") that removes the cost of endurance. Closure is an Earned Stasis, but the lack of on-page friction makes the victory feel inevitable rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.7)
    The pivot relies on a weak causal link (the riddle's vague interpretation), and the climax resolves via a "soft reset" where the starving mob reacts with wonder instead of anger. This bypasses the established causality of resource scarcity and theft.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure leads to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the reliance on the shard as a "skeleton key" to instantly explain the mystery reduces narrative tension and makes the discovery feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid, utilizing the telepathic flashback ("dominoes falling upward") effectively to compress backstory. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "structural weakness" parallel at the end feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds toward a moment of Charged Poise. While the external loop does not break on the page, the "Conceptual Repricing" of the prison—from infinite to merely "seventeen billion steps"—radically alters the meaning of the climb. The ending lands with the weight of Sisyphus happy, earning its stasis through the literalized cost of the worn die.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on a "magic wand" solution where the brush resolves the conflict instantly, followed by a frictionless viral success montage. The closure is an unearned "happy ending" (community forms immediately) with zero visible or felt cost. The narrative lacks a causal chain of choices; events unfold through coincidence and magical intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, driven by the situational pressure of the thaw. The closure (documenting the end) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the loss of the physical history), satisfying the rubric's requirement for a decisive ending.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line with strong orientation and a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure (recontextualizing her life's work). The reliance on a "grandmother's journal" and "microscopic etchings" as an instruction manual reduces narrative friction, making the solution feel slightly inevitable rather than earned through trial.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible with a distinct closure (leaving with the contained Fear), but the reliance on the "dream dictionary"—a convenient prop found off-screen to provide exact instructions—weakens the causal chain. The solution feels more like following a manual than a character-driven discovery, though the final reconfiguration of the threat is satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path from problem to solution, with a defined closure unit (Decisive Change). However, the resolution relies heavily on the sudden arrival of the whales (external aid) and the "sonic engineering" magic system, which lowers the sense of earned causality. The stakes are resolved without a significant complication or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight and effective, moving from the silence (inciting incident) to the discovery of the crack and the final decision. The reversal at the climax—where the message warns "Do not follow" and she chooses to follow anyway—adds significant weight and cost to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a significant logic break: an abandoned station's telegraph successfully transmitting complex manuscript data to seventeen recipients instantly. This "technological magic" resolves the central conflict too conveniently, bypassing the physical constraints of the setting and undermining the story's grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands effectively with the sealing of the bottle, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ruin becomes a reliquary. The timeline and spatial constraints of the island and drawbridge are handled with clear logic and anchor the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Structure is exemplary; the ticking clock of the pressure/power restoration creates natural urgency that tightens the focus. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the algae from mere light source to "patient guardians," effectively recontextualizing the environment with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("As weeks passed") rather than a continuous scene, diluting immediate tension. The pivotal turn—seeing the future in the gem—is a coincidental discovery rather than a consequence of the protagonist's agency, weakening the causality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight, utilizing the "cooling time" countdown to create effective structural pressure. Closure is achieved through a decisive change with visible cost (arrest) and a clear alteration of the world state, satisfying the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B-to-C progression smoothed by coincidence (the pilgrim’s timely arrival) and low-friction problem solving (montage of pulling stones). The logic of ancient stone carvings emitting thermal "star trails" detectable by drone at twilight creates a causality gap. Closure is achieved through a "gift" of knowledge rather than a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a mysterious inciting incident to a coherent realization and a Decisive Change with visible cost. The connection between the driftwood dates and the protagonist's prior knowledge is slightly convenient, but the closure is forceful and causally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scene structure is tight, with a clear causal chain from the letter to the meeting to the resolution. The closure (Charged Poise) lands effectively, using the drawer pull to anchor the shift in their relationship. The backstory is integrated well to explain the present negotiation tactics without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear "out and back" structure, but the causality between the paddle and the life-changing decision to teach is thin. The ending provides a "soft reset" resolution that solves the protagonist's problem without a visible on-page cost or trade-off. The closure feels imposed by the author rather than driven by the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies entirely on expository dialogue to explain the premise, rules, and stakes, halting momentum. The inciting incident (finding the cave) leads immediately to a static explanation scene rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, using the sensory ritual to drive momentum. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts a new, altered form as a bridge, paying the cost of her humanity to maintain the bond. The logic of the magic system holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from the inciting reflection to the ritualistic closure of the mended saucer. The climax, however, lacks friction; the magic simply works as intended, missing a beat where the outcome is in genuine doubt or requires improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual-completion structure that lacks a "felt cost" at the closure. The resolution—where the barrier "simply ceased to exist" and humanity is healed—is too convenient, bypassing the necessary struggle or sacrifice usually required for such high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path to a resonant closure (dissolution into light) that fits the fable-like logic. While the "orchestrated accidents" mechanism feels convenient, the structural build toward the planetary alignment creates a functional, if predetermined, causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing a Causal/Situational Hybrid lens where the blackout enables the signal. Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise, with the revolution primed. However, the inciting incident and climax lack resistance; the obstacles are theoretical (fear of the Chancellor) rather than present in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from ritual to revelation to re-commitment with clear causality. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing of the world’s state. The orientation and pacing are effective, though the "flashback" within the vision risks slowing momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structural use of the darkroom timer creates a solid rhythmic backbone for the scene, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The reliance on a discovery from three weeks ago places the true inciting incident in backstory, slightly lowering immediate narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear interaction (wait, meet, agree, leave) lacking a Decisive Change or felt cost. The ending ("Same time next week?") creates a loop rather than closure, resolving the scene with safe business-as-usual scheduling.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure violates the Backstory/Reflection policies, relying on retrospective explanation for over 50% of the text to establish stakes that are never tested in the present. The story is a static tableau of assembly rather than a causal sequence; the closure is a "ready to start" moment that lacks resonance because no on-page obstacle was overcome to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent logic of magic realism, but the closure relies on a wish-fulfillment resurrection that lacks a visible, felt cost on the page. The ritual works perfectly on the first try without complication or sacrifice, making the resolution feel earned by backstory effort rather than immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational arc, resolving with a Conceptual Repricing where the definition of reality is adjusted to save the island. The "Quantum Folklore" pivot creates a satisfying logical turn, though the resolution meets little resistance beyond the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (deciding to write) is a valid Decisive Change. However, causality relies heavily on convenient magical artifacts—the lace explicitly telling him what to do and the compass pointing to "apologies"—which simplifies the resolution. The closure feels somewhat mechanical due to these instructional props.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visit layers butterfly-dust data that silently reweights Elena's scientific premise until she abandons it. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—her notebook sentence reweights decay as instruction—and the cost is felt in the demolition reprieve won by her non-publishable work. A single shard of reflective backstory (≤20 %) is anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frost’s “brief, harmless luminescence” reweights her father’s radioactive legacy with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: ledger → recognition → renunciation. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 30. The only slack is that the “new life” leap is compressed into one sentence; still, the image carries the cost, meeting the 9+ quick test’s spirit.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each thermal snapshot adds density until the aurora-lit dawn reweights silence from deficit to new lexicon. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands in a “concert hall” of temperature, foreclosing rescue-by-sound forever. Cost is visible: “tears had frozen on her cheeks.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: package → lens coordinates → impossible descent → library as morgue → Silas reframes lens into reverse-lighthouse that lets knowledge die. Each because/therefore hinge tightens options until the climax replaces light with shadow-sleep. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: he writes the farewell note, abdicating his prior life. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each midnight bell ring layers density until anonymity becomes identity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marta’s final toll crystallizes the community’s self-sustaining ethic; the cost is her expendability now that the system no longer needs her. Causality is coherent via “because/therefore” of gifts returned. One micro-turn (the first basket appearing) sets up the pattern without breaking ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is cleanly achieved: the camera opened, images released, repository fed—an earned stasis that forecloses her former practice yet charges the world. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each photograph, breath, and bloom accretes until the cadence shift dissolves them into the violet door. Causality holds because the breathing pattern she learned from the inherited memory literally unlocks the arch; no coincidence resolves the crux. Cost is legible in the final image—“empty and full simultaneously”—but the instruction delivered by the ghost rather than discovered through trial keeps this a hairline below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—photographs bleeding, bridges folding, selves layering—and holds it to the final image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fragment’s dissolution is irreversible, reweighting the premise that time is fixed; the cost is the luminous ache left on her skin and the eternal gardener role she now cannot shed. No causality is broken; every impossible fold is motivated as memory-garden architecture. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation (hyperbolic geometry, pre-born photographs) pays off when the same devices crystallize her release.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty arcade glowing with unclaimable seeds reweights the Authority’s sterile future. Causal chain is tight: seed-arrow → decoded keys → snapped link → loaded exodus.

Still, the final image of “ten thousand possible futures” carries undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of absent sounds builds to a resonant reconfiguration.

Orientation is crisp by line 3; no causal breaks; cost is tactile (“heavier despite no mass”).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: moonbeam motif and color cadence tighten toward final conceptual repricing (“truth is more beautiful than the lie”). Single shard; spatial/time anchors clear by ~80 words; no orientation penalty. Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost: Cassia shoulders perpetual burden of unveiled truths. Persistent constraint—her need to keep walking into next night—shapes final image. Minor causal slippage: moonbeam mechanics not foreshadowed, but lyrical pattern teaches rule early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marina’s torch-light invites others to seed the zone with questions, reconfiguring the plant from reactor to sanctuary; the conceptual cost—perpetual exposure risk—is undeniable in the cracked bookmark’s shadow. The accumulative pattern (ice → water → glass → light) tightens once when the couple arrives; every sphere laid on dead consoles is a beat that reframes safety as crafted, not given. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: child’s cast → coordinates → shell resonance reversal → Jake’s collapse. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Marcus becomes the keeper of terrors he once suffered. The lens is causal throughout; each beat narrows options until only self-authorship remains. Mid-scene orientation is firm by 80 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: each star-dimming flake adds density toward a map of absence. Closure is a quiet CR—the night is endless process, not endpoint—felt cost is the lifetime already spent. Orientation clear by line 4; no causality break. Lacks one tightening beat that would foreclose a live option; hence stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ice violin sublimates in his hands, reweighting the premise that consciousness is janitorial labor rather than a gift; cost is the unspoken eternity of that service. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetitive loops and sensory density tighten until the cadence itself becomes the revelation. Orientation is clean by line 4; no causal break. One minor scaffold: “seventeen distinct timeline loops” is stated twice in adjacent sentences (−0.2) but does not touch the final image, so cap applies only here.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens gathering rain and moonlight reweights their future as “clear and ambiguous” with undeniable emotional cost. Causal chain holds: doodles → meeting → confession → shared risk → handclasp; each beat tightens options under transparency pressure. Orientation anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image: the lens “gathering rain and moonlight equally”—their shared vulnerability made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the maze “laughing” reweights the entire luck-index premise without exposition. Causal chain holds: because Marta lies to plants, they survive; because she gifts the lie, the girl leaves with altered tactics. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 50 words; no disorientation. Persistent constraint—Ministry scanners—shapes every tactic; cost is felt when inspector capitulates. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: accumulation of cracked marbles tightens meaning until the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lever locks, time is declared multidimensional, and Ira smiles—cost is conceptual, not felt. Causal chain is loose: magnetic twilight + lever → holographic fractals → temporal vision; no obstacle or reversal tightens options. Orientation is clear by line 10; lens is Accumulative/Textural—images layer until meaning reweights—holds through final honey-water glow. The station shudder is the only external complication but is ignored once sounded, so tension plateaus rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water-damaged program as developing photograph is a clean, magical-realist engine; each bleed is a because-step that reveals new notation, tightening options toward the shared closure. Orientation is secured within 70 words and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is stable. The final image—restored program signed by both centuries—delivers Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (Marcus’s通宵 transcription, the flooded pit now drained of its magic).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudged drawing taped to the margin reweights the entire premise—official knowledge vs. lived contradiction—with undeniable social/epistemic cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each hidden illustration adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—her body as “second, wiser heart”—shapes the final quiet act.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Marcus leaves the valve untouched, crystallizing the shift from collector to witness, with conceptual cost legible in the final image of “metal dust, like prayer.” Causal chain—radio testimonies → valve location → choice to document—holds under an Accumulative lens; each caller adds density that reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (who, where, when). Non-closure slips are minor: the “swallowed truth” metaphor is repeated without deepening, and the timeline of callers vs. tunnel descent could be tighter, but these do not touch the resonant exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held; closure is a Charged Poise that prices the keeper’s eternal silence. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives ~80 words, safe. No causality break, but no tightening turn either—pressure accretes through imagistic repetition rather than narrowing option. Cost is conceptual (perpetual witness) and felt, satisfying closure gate yet remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory callback (lullaby under maple roots, copper glint, wind spiral) layers density until the eclipse darkness reweights the stake from “keep” to “release.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the curl vanishes into the corona, the song passes to Sofia, cost is the irrevocable empty envelope—visible, felt. Orientation anchored by 40 words; no causality breaks; one clean transition from daylight to totality. Persistent constraint: the curl’s absence will shape every future lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the axis-shift realization reweights all prior wall-whispers and forecloses Thrain’s option to leave. Causal linkage holds—tapestry + diary → insight → custodial vow—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Cost legible in final line: “stories would be waiting… ready to remember themselves into being.”

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s disappearance reconfigures the island’s open-secret symphony under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early—fortunes as musical notation—pays off when he writes himself out of the score. Causality holds: each slip he leaves dictates tomorrow’s fallout, so his vanishing is the final note. Cost is conceptual but legible in the blank slips and abandoned specs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early and held: each loop layer literally builds the mandala that will dissolve the demon. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“she remembered how to inhabit her own assumptions”—and the dimensional anchor reappears in the final image, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the folded horizon crystallizes all whens, fortunes swirl, and Mei’s arms lift—cost is the irreversible surrender to non-linear time. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored spirals taught early, cadence intensifies to final image. Orientation anchored by word 60 (glass spire, frozen lake, palm on window). No causal break; ellipsis of factory firing is paid off when spiral reweights memory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story teaches its accretive, lyric pattern early—viaduct rebuilding itself, drop-vs-ripple interval as chronotope—and holds it cleanly to the Earned Stasis close. Causality is conceptual rather than sequential: pressing the rune triggers macro-integration, foreclosing omnipotent drift. Orientation is immediate: who/where/when locked by line 3. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “touched down…no longer needed by someone who had finally learned the difference…” The choice is irreversible and paid for by surrendered omniscience, satisfying closure under Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor hairline: “procedural generation” is named late, but the viaduct’s morphing teaches the rule earlier, so lens ambiguity waived.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the needle’s polished tip crystallizes her new stance—silence embraced as living music. Causal linkage holds: because the needle scars the reversed groove, therefore vibration bypasses dead ear and rekindles sensation. The cavern, season shift, and phonograph mechanics are anchored by 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is visible—she leaves with further-worn needle and permanently altered sensorium—felt in the final footstep rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elena commits to continued observation with expanded risk, foreclosing the option of safe ignorance; cost is legible in the “something unbreakable” she now must conceal. Causal lens holds throughout—because she was followed, because the note confirms data theft, therefore she lateralizes her methods. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elena’s courtyard”) and never loosens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara-as-perfume-greenhouse reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact: because she uncorks, therefore she is transformed; because she weeps, therefore the conservatory blooms invisibly. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent layers density until a pattern break (empty vial) reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3); the single transition (memory flash) is taught early and paid off in the spectral projection on glass.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus reweights the premise that justice can balance, carrying the rope’s inheritance of silence forward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each peeled layer densifies moral cost rather than pivoting plot. Cost is legible in the final image: “carrying time’s texture in his bones,” a felt price under starlight. One soft spot: the beings’ motivation (“they fed on moral complexity”) is narrated rather than dramatized, a micro-break in taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is not vanquished but repurposed into a “canvas of quietude,” a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds—each note she risks summons musicians, each damaged response mirrors the forest loss. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 4; greenhouse geography stays coherent. No plot amnesia; violin, bowl, and setting states track cleanly to the final moonlit note.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed grotto and Vera’s retreat into night reweight the stakes—she can carry mercy only by remaining emotionally exiled. Causal chain holds: dusk window → loosened amber → petal harvest → rule-enforced renunciation. Orientation is clean by line 3; timeline (exact dusk span) is tethered throughout. One micro-turn—the temptation to absorb—sets up the final restraint without breaking the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal spine is clean: mis-addressed envelope → island detour → estranged-sibling reunion → library re-inheritance. Closure lands with visible cost—the photo tucked beside ledgers re-weights her life’s accounting. The 90-word orientation window is slightly loose (who/where explicit only at ~130 words) but the breezy library image is memorable enough to waive penalty. One tightening beat suffices; no reversal, but the because/therefore chain holds.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the arbor becomes a communal mirror (Charged Poise) whose cost is the admission that they almost let their founding artist vanish. The spiral-path reveal is motivated by visible pattern, not coincidence, and the final image reweights every prior reed-sculpture as dialogue. Causality is intact, though the summit ascent is telescoped; still, the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: pendant hum → canal climb → dive through breathing gap → chamber revelation → completing drawings → time restored. Each step tightens because/therefore links; the climax physically returns stolen moments, forcing city-wide readjustment. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: canals flow normal, pendant cracked, new drawings begin—undeniable cost visible on page. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chipped mosaic equation reweights loss as a solvable continuum, visible cost is the glass eyes relinquished. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—fungal rings, drop-intervals, apple-light patterns accumulate to the final equation. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared mission crystallizes in the archivist’s “I know you’re there,” reweighting both characters’ options with undeniable emotional cost. Causal chain is clean: each fragment drop and retrieved object advances knowledge and trust. The drive lens is steady Accumulative/Textural; pattern of gifts and recovered memory tightens the dominant stake without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each rain-soaked image layers density until the merging leaf reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—“something necessarily in between”—with visible cost (his dissolved palm). No orientation debt; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara crosses the vanishing causeway with the jar pressed to her chest, options reweighted—she can now paint truth but only until the last drop. Causal chain holds—brooch → rain → exchange → artistic mission—each because/therefore step narrows her next hour. The tide’s clock supplies persistent constraint; three-hour countdown is legible by midpoint and felt at the end. Cost is indelible: the woman will bury the brooch, Mara forfeits her heirloom future, and the water is finite, all stated on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pearl dissolved into her palm reweights the rule-set—she now sees the living present instead of futures, and the cost is the felt luminescence under her skin. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystal note adds density until the final image crystallizes meaning without a causal “event.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are legible by word 80; deliberate disorientation inside the cave later pays off by charging the bright-darkness reconfiguration. No causality breaks; the void she steps into is the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valve’s whisper reweights exile from wound to grammar, cost legible in “sum of presence and absence.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of cataloguing light/ink/water-marks tightens meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is swift; no prop or knowledge teleporting. One minor scaffold: “staggered intervals” is declared twice without on-page calibration. Otherwise structure is taut, transitions legible, final image reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tile’s proof of interconnection reweights Elena’s stance, satisfying Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (“she had spent years trying to separate…now integrating”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of whale–star–memory resonance thickens until a cadence shift; no orientation debt. One causality wobble: the tile’s “true pattern” exposure is summary, not beat-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the fused amulet opens a quiet door and Vex steps through, paying the conceptual cost of abandoning eternal safety. Causal chain holds—because she scattered the fragments, because Thorne returns with the rest, therefore they can complete the key and exit immortality. Accumulated reflection stays under 20 % and is anchored to present tactile cues (amulet pulse, storm glare). No orientation debt; who-where-when is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Maya hands over both stolen pot and restitution envelope, condemning her father’s memory to “Everything” of love minus his crimes—conceptual cost legible in the final line. Causal chain holds: Wei’s breach is the irreversible trigger; Maya’s honesty dissolves his revenge, permitting the exchange. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A mid-scene flashback block edges past 20 % but is anchored to present tactile cues (embalming cream, ink pot) and alters Maya’s next move, meeting BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp switched off, the notepad warm, the town waking below—an earned stasis that forecloses nothing yet reweights everything. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charted modulation layers density until dawn’s first light reframes the archive. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the final image crystallizes the stakes with visible cost (her fatigue, the silent monk’s recognition). No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of layered annotations and tide-cycle returns tightens until the fresh-ink injunction reconfigures Mari’s solitary erasure into communal testimony. Closure—“she signed her mother’s name, then her own, then something in between”—pays the cost of permanent namelessness. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory becomes a living archive of regret, Marina’s participation costs her professional detachment, and the final image (“waves…keeping time”) reweights the premise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each resonance layer deepens emotional density rather than forcing external reversals. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The cost is felt rather than declared, satisfying the 9- gate although not quite transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine works: graffiti warning → Maya decodes → community incorporates as heritage → developers face new legal shield. The “reorganize” pivot is legible and lands with a communal cost (nights of painting, permits, forgery). Yet the single-paragraph jump from “we reorganize tonight” to “within days the city bloomed” compresses the decisive friction; we don’t watch a single resident balk or a lawyer poke holes, so the tightening is told, not felt. Closure image—Maya at the edge, stone in hand, boats approaching—gives a Charged Poise that reweights options: they float free but the siege is ongoing; cost is implied but not yet paid on-page, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the camera secured, the hourglass left behind, the rocket arriving—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of human presence, weighted by the final image of “dawning hush.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each preparation beat (grain isolation, chemical timer, descent) tightens the stakes until the last wisp of ice is converted into irreversible record. The lens holds without slip; cost is felt in the act of abandonment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: explosion → heightened hearing → droplet sonar → drone repair → ship sails. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at “Meridian anchor lift in twenty minutes” narrows options to a single beat. Closure is Earned Stasis: Maya refuses external validation and returns to bench; cost is the audible departure horn that marks her perpetual exile from the voyage she enabled. No teleporting props; every tool and droplet is tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: empty message tube → condensation epiphany → decision to share. The closure beat—“I can show you where the rivers begin”—pays off the polyglot’s breadcrumb trail with a concrete, irreversible offer; the cost is the surrender of sole ownership of her discovery. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the inspector’s arrival is coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens rules.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town’s collective rhythm now sustains itself, the tuner’s exit note adding final resonance. Causality is folkloric rather than personal—footfalls magically mend stone—but the pattern is taught early and holds. The “before the collapse” frame supplies conceptual cost (other towns will fall), satisfying the price test.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each memory-thread and oxygen droplet deepens density until the final breath reweights existence itself. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“crystal perfume vial pulsed”) and spatialized through spiraling corridors. Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty vial drifting upward crystallizes the irreversible fusion of Maya with the temple’s eternal congregation, cost paid in physical death and conceptual repricing of “distress signal” as invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is tight: hidden journals → corridor breach → lattice testimony → dawn exposure. Orientation locked by sentence 4—name, prison #, reef—so salt-green plates teach the world before 120 words. Closure is decisive: the lattice absorbs the confession, irreversibly publicizing truth; Marcus’s physical impossibility becomes the very engine that lets the maze print his words. Cost lands in the final image—“the lighthouse prison had been built to contain liars. Tonight, it would finally hold the truth”—the building’s purpose flips because Marcus’s hover-body can reach the screen no warder ever could.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: bead’s warmth → her arrival → revelation his line must release her → dawn returns. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are vivid within first 120 words; no disorientation. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the breaking bead reweights three centuries of poisonous protection into mortal fruit and daylight; cost is legible in the orchard’s transformation and Marlow’s salt tears. One minor causality wobble: “resonant awakenings” are name-checked but never defined or shown to alter tactics, so their narrative function is decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sleepwalk layers a spiral path that reweights the stake—threading ruin into reverence—until the final image crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure is on-page: the painted children colonize the canyon wall, undeniable conceptual cost (“permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide”). One causality wobble: the plate’s sudden animation is not prepped by any tactile cue earlier, a micro-teleport, but it pays off within the lyric pattern so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the shadow’s first sweep across the name-carved hours crystallizes the circular diaspora logic and reweights every prior image. Causality is clean—because she finds the gnomon and reads the inscription she kneels, therefore foreclosing flight. Orientation is anchored by line 8 (who, where, when). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each marriage of root and bone intensifies density until the final cadence shift. Cost is unmistakable—“Time returns all wanderers to their purpose” both honors and imprisons her.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (brass light, chalk dust, engine rumble) intensifies the single dominant stake—time-delayed intimacy—until the closing photograph crystallizes both preservation and loss. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the impending rain will erase the code, making the analog photo the only true relic, a felt cost legible on the final line. Orientation is anchored within the first 90 words; transitions are seamless. The causality is thematic rather than event-based, fitting the lyrical design.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is iron: because officers dismiss Vera, they speak; because sheembroiders, intelligence travels; because she threads the eternal flame, only resistance eyes can read tomorrow’s map. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her stitched sky reweights the empire’s possibilities while the candle’s luminous thread makes her invisible network undeniable. Persistent constraint (the flame that never dims) literally shapes the covert optics of the final chart. One meaningful tightening: Minister Crane’s “official business” warning narrows her clock to tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard crumbles, the unsent words are finally spoken into spirit-wind, and the mother exits the labyrinth stripped of cryptic armor. Causal chain holds: shard warmth → window-words → message released → dust. The 3-yr flashback is cleanly cued by moonlight and condensation, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the misted greenhouse becomes a communal script where Maya’s earlier translator role is conceptually repriced—she now “writes” rather than brokers meaning. Causal linkage holds: because she survives and decrypts, therefore the cast becomes art and the coral changes hands, with felt cost in the phantom-shoulder twinge. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds from first pattern-teach (“shared anxieties hanging like unspoken prayers”) to final image. Persistent constraint: the coral as map-of-scars threads every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light-stroke adds remembered joy, density peaks in communal mural, ends with Charged Poise—Marina’s vow to continue while cradling glowing fragment; cost is the impermanence she accepts. Orientation anchors within 60 words; single-scene default met. One meaningful tightening when network activates and she shifts receiver→creator. Closure image of fragment still glowing reweights earlier stakes; no causal chain break.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: by re-burying the coin Elena rewrites the mural’s rule-set, making future loops inevitable yet unknown, and the cost is felt in her relinquishing interpretive certainty. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each painted layer, reflected syllable, and coin flip adds density until the garden’s acoustics crystallize the “pause” into an audible fork in time. Orientation is swift—inside the Sound Wave Garden by line 3—and the spatial choreography of coin, shadow, and spiral is tracked without slip. The only micro-gap is Marcus’s freeze/unfreeze beat, which is lyrically permissible yet slightly under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s smile while locust “rain” floods the scanners crystallizes his stance—thoughts will stay wild, taxable or not—felt cost is the imminent raid. Causal chain holds: Auditor proximity → seed hand-off → insect countermeasures → tunnel exit → planted city-wide pattern, all propelled by because/therefore logic. Lens is Causal throughout; no orientation drift. Setup of “Cognition Tax” is brief, anchored to scanner squeal, therefore no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the postcard’s pinhole constellations become a Conceptual Repricing that reweights damage as illumination. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“calcium spirals caught echoes of centuries past”) and pays off in the closure image. The cost is palpable—“the galaxy postcard has nearly dissolved”—yet its essence now permeates the shell, foreclosing the path back to weaponized beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of catalogued losses → sensory orchid capture → resonant reconfiguration at the wall. Orientation clean by 60 words; stakes tighten when the cracked bamboo becomes an unrepeatable recording device, foreclosing hesitation—Mira must act before the tube fully splits. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation of glowing orchids re-weights her labor from futility to continuity, the cost the irreversible snap that ends the song. Persistent constraint—the library’s isolation—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal track holds: discovery of mistranslation → all-night decipher → dawn translation → summit stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the manuscript and glowing ink reconfigure tomorrow’s options with conceptual cost (possible war). Orientation anchored by word 60; no spatial drift. Pearl-light payoff at end rewards early prism image, satisfying set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative–lyric lens holds: each return of the breathing amphitheater reweights the stakes toward communal interdependence. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara exits, authorship erased, while carved plans persist; the cost is felt as the water will remember what people forgot. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the two-operator floodgates institutionalize collaboration, locking the town into shared maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “paper trail she thought she’d destroyed” is returned, reframing her past and future with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—each attic session of omission/preservation sets up the final reweighting—though the decisive beat is off-stage (Theodore’s discovery) rather than Margot’s own action. Under Accumulative lens, pattern of dust→pigeon→music→letter tightens into resonant stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle of bare earth reweights the maze from puzzle to sacred threshold, felt cost is the permanent three-degree chill. Causal lattice holds—logbook codes → turns → center—but the final beat is interior summary, not a dramatized gesture, so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of star/coral reflections tighten until the final darkening reweights belonging vs knowledge. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: Mira’s palm on glass crystallizes her new stance; cost is the irreversible dimming of both city and explanatory ambition. Causality intact: feather appears → confirmation → descent → glow → extinction, each step because/therefore. Orientation clean by 120 words: who/where/when (Mira, Atlantic facility, night after dusk) anchored through burnt feather cue.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density until the sprout image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the humming pouch and lullaby-dirge reconfigure meaning with felt cost (“work would never be finished”). No orientation debt; cave anchors arrive by line 8. Causality is thematic, not plot-driven, so the slight softening is lens-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the retreating tide and guitar-pick tribute reconfigure the night’s economics from cash to reciprocity, cost felt in the case’s new weight. Causal lens holds throughout—each audience tier (child, teen, couples) is lured because/therefore by prior calibration—though the “dark winter” reflection block arrives late and unanchored to any present cue, slightly denting causality. Orientation is clean by line 5; one transition (pack-up) is legible. Persistent constraint (two-hour tide window) shapes every set list, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “withdrawal = revelation” taught with tides, echoed in garden, body, dust; closure is Charged Poise—Mira’s star-writ skin reweights the ground for future walkers, cost undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: dust multiplies, energy blooms, dawn = capture; options narrow to martyrdom.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass surface, droplet, and ripple adds density until the final spectrum burst reweights the stake—“surfaces aren’t barriers but birthplaces.” The noctilucent trigger and development letter are early anchors; orientation is secure by line 4. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus stands in gilded water, cost felt in the imminent demolition, options reframed. Persistent constraint—prism atrium destined for bulldozers—shapes every beat without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the phone recording crystallizes a new pedagogical stance whose social cost is legible—“our job is to translate…so maybe they never have to.” The porcelain box functions as persistent constraint; its weight shifts from burden to compass inside a single causal chain. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlight, planet dance, and box scars accrue until a density break reweights the stake; pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 30; no teleporting props or retroactive knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of lanterns → gauge → grandmother image tightens into a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by word 80; the final “infinity” needle spin is a Charged Poise that reweights hope as perpetual ascent, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira sets her notebook beside Voss’s, crystallizing her new role as the next link in an endless chain; the image carries felt cost because she exits into “green passages that had become the world’s new architecture,” i.e., permanent exile. Causal chain holds: negative strip → Voss map → hidden microphones → extraction → new archive. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. One soft spot: the strip’s discovery “yesterday” is off-stage; still, the strip immediately steers every subsequent move, so causality never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each painted layer and echoed lullaby thickens possibility until the sparrow’s song reweights reality. Closure is a Charged Poise—doors “invisible” but now legible, cost felt in the hush before bells. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the jammed bell tower she painted yesterday shapes the final quiet that lets Sophia answer.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated failures etched in the clipboard accumulate pressure until the pattern break (red→amber light) reweights meaning at the end. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within 120 words via terrace, twin suns, ebony prop. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard’s new amber glow re-prices three centuries of grievances with undeniable conceptual cost, and the lens holds without ambiguity. One minor causality wobble: the “younger Kolani delegate” appears without prior spatial cue, but choreography remains trackable and does not fracture escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s salt-fossil silence reweights every prior drought-engineered scar with undeniable moral cost. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—the satellite redirection, salt fusion, and thunder diversion all pay off in the final aerial gaze. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words via drone-feed map and crystalline crunch. The only slack is an over-reliance on reflective exposition to explain the drought scheme rather than dramatizing a beat of choice inside it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is pristine: the prism sanctuary breached, the harvested rebellions released, Lyralei’s body re-christened as living anthology—cost is the Academy’s loss of control and her irrevocable exile from the only role she was trained for. Causal chain holds: each unraveled thread releases a real past courtesan’s dissent that teaches the next loosening. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of crystallized longings tightens until the cadence snaps into liberation. Final image of melted snow-circles reframes the whole courtyard as text now rewritten in her ink.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to reverse the puppet show crystallizes Marcus’s stance and reweights the argument’s echo into future action. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each reflective block is anchored to the campfire stick or meteor hush and returns in the final image. The 120-word orientation anchor is met; radar dome, firelight, and absent collaborators are legible. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knotted stem adds material density until the spiral dissolves, enacting impermanence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch lifts the encoded dust, crystallizing the trade-off—knowledge is saved only by vanishing. The cost is visible in the dissolving fibers and Mira’s night descent. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via grotto coordinates and the single monarch context.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the re-braided rope ready to be played, bronze bells that will “sing a single saved name forever,” and the aurora-lit sanctum melting into dawn. The cost is felt—she forfeits perfect preservation for perpetual transformation—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each braid, card hole, and bell accumulates texture until the final image reweights “memory as transformation.” Causality is lyric rather than plot-heavy, appropriate to the 750-word lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure hits as Conceptual Repricing: “all foresight is hindsight wearing tomorrow’s mask” reweights the entire loop and carries undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Time-flow reversal is taught early via artifact cues—wafer seal as exit, moss-lit processors still humming—then paid off in the final backward-walk image. Causality holds because every “predicted” event is revealed as memory; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she deciphered ratios → found tile → aligned Mars → tile warms → second tile → knowledge uncloaks → beacon activates. Each step tightens options toward the final sealing. Closure is a crisp conceptual repricing: the palace becomes transmitter, her frugality retroactively labeled as down-payment on interstellar contact. One scaffold loop (“empirically ironic” twice) and minor orientation lag (ceiling gaps unnamed for ~140 words) keep it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the box is broken, therefore Marcus can use it as teaching tool; because the Magistrate touches it, therefore his cellular memory rewires. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—soundless weep with broken pin charging the image, undeniable conceptual cost (violence lineage can end). Orientation anchors by word 40 (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (silence, touch-as-speech). Persistent constraint: the pin will never be repaired, yet will “sing again” only through changed song—price shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the hand-mirror’s persistent reflection reweights the premise—dreams aren’t captured but carried—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: cracked sextant → shared breath → visionary projection → relinquished mirror, each step tightening options. The cost is visible in the astronomer’s shuddering breath break and Elara’s parting with her own crafted glass.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: breached contract → cathedral overgrown → eyes dying → granddaughter’s demand → mender returns → mends. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the vow itself is the price paid, legible in the ribbon hand-off. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor softness: the “forgotten” tools appear without prior cue, but the line “no accidents” retrofits motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the apple bite rewrites the rule-set with undeniable cost—she now tastes her own future memories. Causal links remain intentionally circular rather than linear, satisfying the Accumulative lens: pattern density (ledger line, shell glow, blossom up-draft) culminates in a single charged image that re-weights all prior beats. The orientation waiver is earned—deliberate disorientation pays off in the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: diary gaps → map → silk trail → recursive room → negotiation → release. The blank-pages gambit is a decisive, visible cost that rewrites the contract; mountain’s acceptance provides clear DC. Orientation crystalizes by 120 w; no prop or rule break. One minor elasticity: the “hundreds frozen” appear only at the end yet feel narratively weighty—acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a lyrical Earned Stasis: Marina pockets the card, embracing an unprovable guardianship; the cost is the now-unbridgeable distance from Coraline who is already “softening into suggestion.” Causal chain holds—card summons, ship reveals, twin offers exit, protagonist refuses—but the final beat is compressed into one sentence, muting the tangible price. The因为只有一句话，代价的“体感”略显抽象，但概念代价（终身携带不可知）在页面上已不可撤销，满足CR要求。

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mosaic design (rope visions as shards) is taught by 25 % and closure holds under Accumulative lens: each braid adds density until the map of negative space reweights the premise. The thirteenth-chime door is a clean persistent constraint; however, the merged-lands coordinates appear only in the final paragraph, so the decisive change, while legible, lacks earlier tactile set-up and the cost feels conceptual rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds cleanly: alien sonic assault → crack readings → ritual extraction → bloom softens the beings. The echo-stone anchors each step without teleporting or convenient lore dumps. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: silence is not imposed but revealed, and the cost is the lifetime of labor that let her read the fracture manuscript—felt when she notes her maps “would need updating.” Orientation is anchored by line 3; lens stays situational throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens throughout: because the shard lands where Aurelius should be, therefore Mira gains sideways vision; because she chooses to fill the prism with structured silence, the anti-light beacon ignites and ships return. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance flips from guardian of absence to conductor of homecoming—paid for by two decades of solitude. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 80 words; no penalty. Cost is undeniable: the beacon now burns darkness, a permanent inversion she must live inside. Meets 9+ quick test with persistent constraint shaping the final image.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its harmonic feedback constrains every move (she feels the shard impact through vibration), and its ceiling becomes the projection surface for anti-light. Specificity is selective—“crystalline walls vibrating with frequencies only Mira could properly hear” filters through her custodial ear. Spatial choreography holds across tower climb; prism fracture lines map impossible geometries that later guide alignment. Environment charges the final image: pavilion glass fragments dying daylight into whispers of color just before darkness blooms.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing: the act of communal inscription reweights the premise—identity will now be actively invented rather than retrieved, and the cost is the permanent loss of an authentic past. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each crystal memory thickens the texture until Lyra’s quill-glow supplies the decisive shift. Orientation is secure—who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and re-anchored at the forecourt entrance. No meaningful escalation beat occurs before the final inscription, but the closure is legible and felt under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage holds: because the sky is starless, the mosaic artist arranges “REMEMBER WONDER,” which therefore draws Kaia, whose know-how therefore ignites the courtyard display, foreclosing retreat. Closure lands in the sustained bloom of light that “pushed back against the darkness itself,” a Charged Poise that reprices their night with visible, conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 4; no ambiguity at the end. Persistent constraint—the absence of real stars—shapes every tactical decision and the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen’s closed fingers around the cicada crystallize the option of return, the cost his acknowledged fear. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—star-fields in tide-pools, mating metaphors of molting—each image deepening the stake of bearing witness to transition. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is stable (Mira’s calm dismantles Chen’s withdrawal). Cost is felt but slightly diffuse—no single line screams loss—hence not breaching 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crystallized Conceptual Repricing: the act of bottling “gilded quiet” reweights safety from compression to expansion, with the father-vial as visible, felt cost. Causal lens holds: doll crack → tendril → harvest → reformed doll forecloses return to bunker logic. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleport or amnesia. One 40-min clock, one inversion, one tightening—sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as “Earned Stasis”: Marcus’s quiet navigation forecloses his own isolation model and gifts the passenger a usable silence; cost is felt in the admission “I was once a passenger too.” Causal linkage holds: every terrace modulation is because-of atmospheric pressure read through the vial, therefore gondola speed changes. Orientation is immediate; world-rules (sound refraction, vial reliability) are taught early and pay off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the throne is revealed as a deliberately unclaimable monument to restraint, reweighting every prior “search” beat. Causal linkage holds—each paint layer discovery tightens the central paradox rather than postpones it—and the sunrise countdown provides a single meaningful intensification. The ruby flake’s dissolution is the visible cost, making the cost legible on the page. Lens remains Accumulative/Textural throughout; no ambiguity at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s warmth and the graduate shadows gathered under starlight reconfigure the meaning of every burned bridge. Cost is visible—“some entries must be destroyed to find exit”—and constraints persist (tomorrow another shadow will arrive). One minor causality cloud: the moment the ring became warm is told rather than shown in a concrete beat, blunting the decisive snap that would make this 9-plus.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: turning the bolt rewrites the pyramid from scam to筛选, felt cost is legible (“she’d been climbing toward light all along”). Causal lens holds—each glitch message tightens the “therefore” toward the counter-clockwise act. The Orientation Test is met by word 80; no ambiguity at exit. Minor slack: Dr. Chen’s off-page invitation is told, not dramatized, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the thrown crank and the inability to hear the mockingbird reweight the rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—knowledge forfeited. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative lens: each ancestral memory-wave intensifies the density of guilt until the pattern break (silence) crystallizes choice. The Orientation Test is satisfied: who/where/when anchored by line 3. One minor causality bump: the “sixty-year” record is introduced late yet still pays off in the climax image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lucid Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse walls crack open to “unmade light,” Aldric becomes guardian of latent worlds, and the cost—his human solidity—glints in the final image of blood-turned-trees. Causal links hold: marionette program → oath → puppets wake → reality layers unsnap; each hinge is on-page. Orientation is swift (who/where/when in first 90 words) and the Accumulative/Textural lens thickens until the final membrane-breach reweights all prior imagery. One minor wobble: the “three centuries ago” snap is told not shown, but it only backdrops, never breaks, the present causality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus’s decision to index grace rather than chase his own file reweights the premise—archaeology of kindness supersedes self-excavation. Cost is legible: he extinguishes the immediate chance at maternal truth, choosing witness over discovery. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: dust, button, marginalia accumulate until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Persistent constraint—the limited archive shift—shapes his nightly ritual and final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lattice is tight: key → lagoon map → tunnel archive → dawn upload → leaders’ arrest used as distraction. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sunrise turns lagoon silver as the Ministry’s reality monopoly is publicly punctured; cost is the emptied resistance cell she can’t save. Orientation is anchored by 112 words; lens holds. One scaffold loop (“another revised history, another convenient lie”) is a –0.2 artifact but does not touch the final image; otherwise propulsion is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy still exists but is “wrapped in unplayed jazz,” a social/artistic cost made legible in the final rain-bow prism image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of negative sound swells until it reweights the stake. Causality is clean: grandfather’s failed destruction → Marcus’s negative-space tactic → collective silence → prophecy dormancy. One waver: “words began to fade” is told, not shown, but the final droplet-carries-syllable image retroactively anchors the magic rule.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new role is crystallized in the image of moss spreading wherever she touches, a living signature that reweights every prior seed-sorted syllable. The cost is unmistakable—her eyes now hold “depths that hadn’t existed before,” foreclosing an ordinary life. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonstone speck → cairn building → leaf-letters → interpretive gift layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-break (compass→clocks→leaves) reweights the dominant stake from “repair” to “befriend imperfection.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the spinning compass crystallizes new temporal options with undeniable conceptual cost—he will never fix again. Orientation is anchored within 30 words; no spatial drift. Single causal gap: the greenhouse discovery is lucky, yet coincidence is allowed to complicate, not resolve, so no penalty. The cost (foreclosure of his former identity) is legible in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the coin’s golden fracture reweights identity as repair, not erasure, and the dawn image crystallizes cost. Causality holds—coin warmth responds to Vera’s alchemical body—without convenient amnesia. One soft loop (“weight of names” twice in final paragraph) does not dull the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure lands as Charged Poise: Thomas’s dissolution into sunrise light reconfigures the gorge’s acoustic/memory rule-set and is felt as cost (his lingering laugh). Causal chain—Mara’s hum → Thomas embraces discord → release—stays intact. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. A 0.3 reserve remains because the persistent constraint (tooth compass) does not tighten or pay a price for Mara in this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the inverted strap-motion becomes the story’s new mathematics, foreclosing victimhood with felt cost. Causal chain holds—each remembered trauma-response seeds the reciprocal motion that ends the piece. Orientation is immediate; UV forest and Coalition exile are anchored by word 60. One transition (station → forest) is legible and patterned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory data and pattern repetition reweight meaning; no contradiction at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira pockets the transformed painting, foreclosing the option to leave history sealed. Cost is felt—she will trespass beneath the lighthouse—but the causal chain skips the actual retrieval, so the “before/after” is legible yet not fully paid on-page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the pentimento reveal is the single intensifier that reweights stakes. Pattern is legible, but the final beat lands more in future conditional than present consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Marcus gathers proof, ghosts fade, and the decision to confront the city carries conceptual cost. Causal chain: broken elevator → sight → spring → ledgers → public revelation plan holds. Orientation anchored by line 3. The reflective block (’09 accident) is brief and cues present action, satisfying BRR. Grandmother’s ghost handing the spring is elliptical; tiny causality wobble keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s dissolution and Moth’s scattering rewire the rule-set of negotiable reality, with the frost-to-come as visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly linear; the pattern is taught early via frost → whisper → print chain and holds through the final image. The compression-of-eternity beat is on-page and charged, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but a hairline slip in lens clarity at the multi-self flash keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Cassia’s promise of resurrection re-weights the entire dispute and the Venusian archive from “artifacts” to “waiting souls,” with the visible cost that she commits to an impossible, possibly self-immolating act. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: temporal light, baroque excess, and shard-whispers layer until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: the shard’s etchings → memory-map claim → ghosts appear → Huang’s curiosity shifts → Cassia seizes the opening. The persistent constraint is her irrevocable exile and the Institute’s legal grip—both still in force as she begins to speak in verse.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because Elias can weave truth into mechanics, he can re-ignite the sun. The one-line reveal ("hearing the whispered words") is a motivated ellipsis that flips his tactic from secrecy to broadcast. Closure is a Decisive Change—sunlight returns—with conceptual cost: the Council's centuries of rusted lies evaporate. Orientation is nailed inside 120 words; the only minor drag is a mid-paragraph lore dump about the "first midnight council" that could have been parsed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lagoon wall shimmers, the vial is full, and the option to follow Hartley remains open but priced—cost is legible in the compass’s wild spin and the factory dust she re-inhales. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scent → memory → portal is taught by 25 % and tightens once when the lagoon glow intensifies. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“limestone cliffs”) and never falters. No causal reversals are required; the single deepening (petrichor from “not quite Earth”) reweights the dominant stake. Persistent constraint: the vial she carries is now radioactive with impossible rain—this object will shape future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the archway’s turbine-hum becomes her compass, reconfiguring freedom as unmapped attention with felt cost—she drives away from certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each temporal layer (shipwright, stonecutter, future potter) densifies the stake until the spiral sculpture crystallizes the pattern. The GPS resurrection is no cheap fix; it frames the choice to refuse its directions. Causality intact: the slide warms → she sees → she carves → she renounces maps.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early via the layered postcards and holds through the final image of snow settling on copper; each seasonal layer adds density rather than causal turns, and the closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s walk-away leaves the secret poised for transmission. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The cost is felt in her phosphorescent-stained fingertips and the pavilion’s winter lock-up. A hairline slip: “the dawning hush between seasons” is abstractly stated rather than imaged, slightly dulling the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “infinity of floating libraries” reframes the diary not as betrayal ledger but as love-and-betrayal braid, reweighting the myth of pure activism. Causal chain holds: diary → temporal trap → shoreline cipher → truth choice. Orientation clean by line 5; transitions legible under Hybrid lens (Accumulative past/present overlay, Situational pressure of myth vs fact). Cost is felt: “the real encryption had never been in the diary’s symbols but in the courage required to face the full truth.”

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s potential is rewired through Silas’s body, dust of the bottle a visible price. Causal chain holds—wish-magic exiles him, memory-essence becomes literal bridge, final shimmer pulses because he empties himself. Orientation is clean by 120 words. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density swell rather than a turn, but it reweights the stake and satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: northern tower cracks on cue, manuscript finished, shaving sealed in glass—cost is the swallowed city and his own marooning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of archival acts tightens until the final crystallized image; prophecy deepens texture rather than forcing causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (rooftop garden, drowned streets below, sunset clock). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (“the old world was finally gone”) and re-energized at end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: planting the acorn reweights the entire premise—garden, time, and responsibility—with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: seed-images accrue until cadence shifts in the final paragraph, crystallizing meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 and never drifts; transitions (ice → vapor → soil) are legible inside one continuous scene. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the acorn’s rule-set is taught early and paid off in the final image with visible price—Mira’s solitary future.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: impossible calm → microclimate readings dismissed by logic → granite vibration and animal flight → bell-rope act → villages evacuate → avalanche lands on empty slopes. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: modern system supplemented, not replaced, by ancestral act; “bell rope still warm” images the price she’ll carry. Lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt; stakes tighten once via the zero-hour tradition that forbids unnecessary ringing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the still star’s fade reweights Kepler-9’s isolation from liability to lens. Causal chain intact: vulnerability → still-star sight → renunciation of modern certainties. Cost is felt in “whisper of light” captured by glass—image makes conceptual price undeniable. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction; pattern taught early via nightly polish ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara lifts the warm box and embraces lifelong solitude as custodian of silence; the cost is the “luminous weight” she will carry. Causality holds: because the ghosts cannot touch the covenant, therefore Mara must. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated ghost choreography and the warming glass rather than because/therefore chains. The final image crystallizes stakes under that lens with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reframes time from countable to tactile, and the emerald silo reappears as “lighthouse for those who could no longer navigate by numbered days.” Causality is loose—accumulative/textural lens—but the pattern is taught early and the ending reweights it. Orientation is met by word 80; no penalty. The missing beat is an on-page decision that costs Marcus now; the realization is retrospective, so the cost is conceptual rather than lived, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the broken kite becomes a collaborative art project, crystallizing the “beauty in incompleteness” premise with felt cost—the boy’s loss and Mira’s surrender of her solitary stance. Accumulative lens holds: each image (feather, torn paper, light through rips) layers until the final tableau reweights the stake without causal reversal, satisfying the quiet lyric contract.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the six-month sentence flips from death warrant to appointment, felt cost inscribed in the phosphorescing pillars. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of copper lattice and mineral light reweights the stake. One shard, no orientation drift; the hum in the stone is the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new chemical or architectural detail thickens the pattern until the tower forces Elena to reprice “home.” Anchors who/where/when arrive by line 4 and never drift. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final sentence crystallizes that both doubt and faith were engineered, a reweighting that carries undeniable social cost. The only causality gap is that the synchronization of pilgrimage sites with human brainwaves is declared, not shown to change Elena’s tactics—hence not a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each seed placed adds density until the closing image reweights the battlefield from scar to soil. Orientation is swift—purple twilight, rotting planks, dead reef—within first 50 words. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the promise that memory of war will be “especially fertile soil” crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. One scaffold loop (“within a season… within a year… within a decade”) slightly dulls the final cadence but does not rupture the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is tight: scent distrust → leaf riddle → phonograph translation → magnetic pilgrimage → valley reconfiguration. Each groove-etched color narrows her map options under a Situational lens. Closure is a Charged Poise: the howl crystallizes her new vocation and reweights “distance” from kilometers to shared grief. The cost—leaving Heap safety and admitting the nose can fail—is legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene orientation is immediate: crystalline walls, void where stars were, gilded compass rose all land within 50 words. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each return to the compass re-weights meaning, culminating in the rice-paper map that literally guides crewmates home. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her endurance becomes the station’s new Polaris—whose cost is felt in her perpetual solitude. No teleporting props; every image is recalled and transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure earns its keep: the amended chessboard becomes a Conceptual Repricing that reverses her master’s hoarding ethos, under a sky that stays “beautifully, intentionally wrong.” Causal chain is slim—no intermediate obstacles after the ascent—but the swap-out beat carries visible cost: knowledge is literally cracked open. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift at the board rather than through because-therefore turns.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each spelled word thickens the gallery’s acoustic pattern until the final “WE REMAIN” reweights the empty king row into a conceptual tomb. Closure is Charged Poise—she forecloses testimony, accepting perpetual limbo; cost is legible in the echo that will answer her instead of any state. Orientation anchored by 120 words: “abandoned parliament,” “interregnum,” curved marble. No causality break; even the off-stage invite is a pressure increment, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sense-memory (rain-smell, soil-ache) layers density until the skylight chamber breaks pattern, reweighting stakes from seeing to growing. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“mercury-glass seer lived deep within the mountain’s hollow chambers”). Closure—planting the stone, mercury stilled—lands as Conceptual Repricing: futures are no longer watched but cultivated, cost legible in “she didn’t seek visions of tomorrow.” No causality breaks; every beat is textured accumulation that culminates in the garden shift.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he taught the wrong defense → exile → seeks woven hush → decodes tapestry → reweights self-concept; each beat tightens options until the final renunciation forecloses self-flagellation. Orientation secured by word 80; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise as the copper piece and distant thunder crystallize new stance with felt cost (“some storms never break”). No plot amnesia, no late rule change; persistent constraint (frozen time) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the ossuary becomes an irreversible amplifier, costing the Silencers their monopoly and Kira her safety. Causal logic holds—because she climbs and speaks, the chamber’s memory is seeded—though the off-page prisoner chorus is an ellipsis that could weaken causality in a longer piece. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the three-hour clock is invoked early and tightens the shard. The single-scene default is met; no prop teleport or knowledge breach.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: charm-click → golden memory veins → platform collapse → crystallized record. Each beat tightens because the next cable dissolution shrinks time, forcing higher narrative stakes. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the acid sea is about to erase her body, yet the charm’s glow makes the conceptual cost—world-death vs story-immortality—undeniable. Persistent constraint (dissolving moorings) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: placing the new shell reweights forty-three years of quay paintings as the same practice of “loving completely while letting go.” Cost is legible in the cracked mirror image and the solitary walk home carrying a secret. Causal lens dominates: wrong turn → cave discovery → shell placed. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged intention/jasmine garden explodes into sensory life at the touch of translucent fingers, reweighting love itself into a new hybrid state. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each repetition of jasmine, cork, and spiral stair thickens the texture until reality thins and the unsaid becomes matter. Causality is coherent within its own metaphysics: purification → scent → materialization. Cost is unmistakeable: Thomas’s half-corporeality and the perpetual cobalt light that will keep them border-creatures forever. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: broken hydraulics → manual crank → midnight calls → brother rescue attempt; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation anchors (who=patchwork navigator, where=starlit signal station, when=post-flood night) land before 120 words. Closure is Earned Stasis: she abjures migration, cost = perpetual exile as lighthouse keeper; bronze warmth on lap makes price visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she cannot lie, therefore she seeks the truffle; because she finds the hidden tin, therefore she dares the cure. Closure lands as Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the glass eye clacking like dice reweights every prior confession. Verdigris tin appears early, pays off in middle, and the clouded eye reprises at end—tight Chekhovian weave. No orientation debt; ravine, storm, year-zero virus anchored by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lighthouse sweep layers density until the coordinate-scratches in the dock teach the reader the pattern of edited time. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Magnus’s “isolation” is re-priced into chosen vigil now that stolen joy has been returned; the cost is the irreversibility of decades already swallowed. Causality is coherent: because the boutonnière resists, therefore he probes the dock; because the gaps align with lighthouse beats, therefore he deciphers the temporal coordinates. The only hairline slip is a single register lift—“conceptual repricing” is the narrator’s meta-language, not Magnus’s—but it occurs after the decisive image and so barely grazes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each map, insect line, and water level adds density until the doorway reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus steps back into the same world but is now “someone who followed them,” a charged poise that reweights every prior sale of other people’s dreams. Cost is legible in the chip’s cooled state and the irreversible abdication of his settled, lonely life. Pattern is taught early (rising creek, ants), transitions are seamless, and the final image lands with conceptual rather than expositional force.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine holds: dream → raven → climb → grotto bargain → metamorphosis. Orientation is swift (“morning mist,” “ember grotto on the ridge”) within 120 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cycle restarts with the niece’s dream, making Seraphina’s loss the kingdom’s future cost. One causality bump: the grotto’s voice delivers the rules in a single block of exposition; still, the lens (Causal) remains intact and the price is legible, so the ending lands.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the shell-sun hovers, re-weighting prior failures; cost is the cooled, darkened nexus—loss of old method. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of twilight images and iterative returns tighten until spiral-sun crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleport props. Single micro-turn—shell against nexus—reconfigures rather than resolves, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scroll, scent, and wind-gust thickens the déjà-vu density until the final image of every Maya wing-spread reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—time itself is the price. Transitions are legible across the mosaic of selves; the pattern is taught by the second paragraph (“chronology tangled like mountain paths”). Closure is a Charged Poise: simultaneous soar/fall crystallizes options without safety. One minor waver: grave visit is recounted, not shown, blunting the felt price a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mineral deposits, fog, and screw form a pattern that intensifies until the final loose reassembly reweights “repair” as integration of damage. Orientation is secured by word 60; single-scene default met. Closure is a Charged Poise: water resumes but now carries the daughter’s memory forward—cost is felt in Mrs. Huang’s dissolved sentence and the forever-loose screw. Causality is associative, not because/therefore, yet the pattern holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because she holds her breath, crystals spread; therefore she traces them, producing a rune that literally embodies her flaw. The blank-page test is a clean early stake; the single-scene orientation is anchored within 120 words; the final image (rune glowing, crystals shedding) is a Decisive Change with visible cost—her skin clears, shame falls away. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; even the childhood rhyme pays off causally in the invented character. Closure lands on-page with felt cost and persistent constraint: she must now live as the scholar who wrote herself into being.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Vera’s apology transmutes from private utterance to public column, reframing her whole exorcist ethos. Causal chain holds: because she once ripped Elisabetta out, the orchard’s looming erasure now forces collaborative completion; each falling tree tightens the deadline beat by beat. Orientation is nailed within 60 words; no prop or spatial drift. The lens is causal throughout; no ellipsis breaks the because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure: Conceptual Repricing—dictionary blanks to “Continue” reweights all seventeen ends as illusion; cost is the eternal erasure of certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of hiccup→library walk→unify→blank dictionary tightens via density, not causal chain. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“shelves that curved impossibly upward”). No lens ambiguity; final image crystallizes options under undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each backward count-drop layers density until the final bell crystallizes the reconfiguration—time as distance, paid for by eternal vigil. Causality is poetic but coherent: grandmother’s deathbed whisper → iterative count ritual → earned stasis on the cliff. The 0-beat bell-toll is a textbook Charged Poise: options narrow to stay, cost is the fjord’s unbreathable quiet. No orientation debt; cliff, station, and hour are anchored within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mushrooms’ quantum bridges rewire both farm security and Maya’s emotional stance, cost visible in the dropped laser. Causal chain holds—laser anomaly → discovery → reflection → call—under a Hybrid lens that ends in Accumulative reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by word 50; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is loose: subway clues → library stakeout → stranger delivers thesis. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (“mathematics of contradiction had no proofs, only practice”), yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no forfeited job, no burned bridge, no quarter fed to the hospital slots. Orientation is clear by word 80, satisfying the waiver, but escalation is purely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wrong-number calls thickens, time loops, and the final image of perpetual waiting reweights the stake with conceptual cost—“some endings were just beginnings in disguise.” Orientation is clean by line 6 (who/where/when). The only causal drag: no fresh tightening after Eleanor’s third call; escalation plateaus rather than foreclosing an option, but the closure still lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the covenant handed over while Mara’s hidden codicil forever couples mercy with indictment; the cost is the locket she now inherits—an unpayable weight. Causal chain holds: because Thomas burned the records, Mara regenerates, because she learns the truth, she adds the microscopic indictment, therefore the document now carries both absolution and accusation. Orientation is anchored by wisteria and jetty within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the station becomes a new node in a reciprocity economy, Marcus’s “catalyzed” stance charged with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage is tight—moon rock → rumor bait → phone activation → future network—each step shrinks Sadie’s presence to myth while enlarging Marcus’s agency. Orientation is anchored by line 10; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (monthly call) shapes tactics beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s stillness inside her signals a new mapping power with conceptual cost (she will guide others through grief). Accumulative/Textural lens—languages layering into silence—holds from first line to last. Orientation anchored by ~70 words via tactile bark and humming ring. The final image reweights prior motif (ring, languages, stillpoint) without causal zig-zag, satisfying the cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s dual broadcast keeps both timelines alive, paying the price of perpetual ontological doubt. Causal chain holds: misread pulsar → guilt → anomaly scrutiny → discovery of observer-contingent editing → choice to preserve plural histories. The anomaly’s offer and her refusal to collapse it are dramatized, not summarized. Persistent constraint—the fleet still adrift—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty camera’s final click crystallizes a new language between silence and sight, with undeniable social cost—no audience, no sound, no film, yet music exists. Causality holds: because Maya maps silence for three years, therefore Chen can translate that map back into sign, re-configuring both women’s options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of timestamps + clicks builds density until moonlit harbor re-weights the stake. One micro-drag: “forty years ago” backstory block arrives ~word 260, just past the 120-word orientation cushion; because the harbor moon is already anchored and the block tilts present stance (why she photographs nothing), the orientation test is waived, but the late insert nudges coherence down a tick.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each damaged artwork adds density until the tapestry reweights her identity. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she memorizes the weave, foreclosing the arsonist path—though the epiphany is slightly front-loaded in narration rather than crystallized by a final volitional act.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the system inverts, Mira’s consciousness seeds an autonomous dream-field—cost is the loss of her singular self, signaled in “thirty-seven became infinite.” Causal linkage holds: tap-coded resonance → subnet → fusion → inversion. Orientation clear by word 50; lens (Causal) stable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is tight: storm → GPS dead → only Marcus can navigate → challenge accepted → coin surrendered. Orientation arrives by line 5; the labyrinth’s daily re-shuffle is shown through stacked translucent maps, an elegant image that teaches the pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Chen’s whispered concession reweights the port’s hierarchy and Marcus relinquishes his inherited luck. Cost is palpable—his grandfather’s coin now belongs to the authority he undermined.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thomas leaves lighter, Mira stays in charged poise, cost felt in the surrendered mirror and her resumed silent watch. Causal chain holds—because she withholds speech and instead manipulates light/shadow, therefore Thomas re-interprets his unfinished goodbye. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold loop: “each one a secret finally spoken in the language of light” repeats the lesson already dramatized; minor, does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—stars visible, the town’s stance permanently tilted; the synchronized window gambit supplies visible cost. Causal chain: Elena’s tears → Marcus commits → 9 pm display → collective awakening; each link is present and legible. Orientation is secure by line 10; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation of “amplified quiet” deepens rather than deflates.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: scrimshaw found → claim/evade → shared backstory → unbinding → island surfaces. One smooth scene, ~750 words; orientation anchored by word 50. Closure is Charged Poise: they swim toward an island now permanently manifest because their authentic selves foreclose return to old roles—cost legible in abandoned clothes and dock life.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wooden bird among crumbling petals reweights the rule-set—grief is not erased but hollowed to float. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each whittling curl adds density until the monotone itself becomes the mandate’s mirror. Cost is felt in the final image—“not happier… lighter”—a conceptual repricing that forecloses mandated joy without offering catharsis. No orientation or causality breaks; turbine shadows recur as clock-hands tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (hum-frequency, cobalt light, lake-mirror) intensifies until pattern break at the dance. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of poets striding across cracking ice; conceptual cost is undeniable as scripture-carved truths sink. Orientation anchored by line 7; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: once-lifted ban can be re-imposed, sharpening the final image of collective trespass.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard sculpture sings and the father–daughter embrace reweights all prior trades. Cost is legible in the exposed, once-burned letters and the audible reed—an artifact that now calls the estranged child home. Causal chain holds: flower syntax → confession → sculpture → return. One clean transition (courtyard to gate) is taught early; orientation anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final shared silence re-weights the entire premise—pilgrimage is no longer travel but co-creation, and the cost is the permanent loss of her scripted role. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each improvised bell note thickens the air until pattern-break (off-script interval) crystallises new meaning; causality is interior but coherent. Orientation is nailed by word 60 (who, where, when). No teleports or amnesia. Slight softness: “someone begins to hum” is off-stage; if that first audience voice had been Vera’s shocked recognition, the beat would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena lights the next candle, leaving a crane for the next wanderer—visible cost is the perpetual reopening of her own wound to serve others. Causal chain holds: stranger arrives because Elena keeps beacon lit; Elena keeps beacon because she once slept in her car and was saved. Orientation anchors at line 4 (“The observatory had no clocks…”) and never drifts. One transition (stranger enters) is cleanly cued by candle glow through window.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each black card laid on the algorithmic tape adds density until the ultraviolet reveal reweights the whole archive. Orientation is swift—loft, rain, client arriving—and causality is replaced by pattern recognition; the final image of water finding new paths crystallizes the stakes without a causal duel. Closure is a Charged Poise: the choice to wait 43 days is crystallized, cost felt in the ghost-data hum. The piece teaches its elliptical method early and lands it cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each tier deepens memory-density until the seventh-tier inhalation ruptures the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira walks out carrying “ten thousand years of memory,” a conceptual cost that reweights the entire archive premise. Causality intact—random gait taught early, pays off as key; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity at end; image of saffron veil at dawn reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the translucent figure presses its palm to the lens and Mira’s purpose crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost—she must spend her life curating shadows. Causality is sound: the footage comparison → pattern recognition → stone warmth → ancestral dream transfer → vocation. Mosaic structure (three temporal shards plus present) is taught by word 180 and resolves cleanly. One hairline slip: the Orientation Test is technically passed, yet “above the clouds” geography is slightly floaty until the second shard; the payoff at closure waives any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she lied, therefore exposure arrives; because chips are removed, therefore the tail can be re-attached; because the surgery finishes at dawn, therefore she writes the confession. Each beat tightens her options until only surrender remains. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts bankruptcy and indictment—charged by the image of the ordinary-green ch gripping its branch, cost legible in the glass between them. No orientation debt; stakes are anchored by word 50.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “tiny legible marks” tightens across coffee ring, scar tunnels, hourglass sand until the miracle’s diffusion is reweighted. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—miracle becomes ambient rather than lost—felt cost is Maya’s acceptance of perpetual openness; image of turning the hourglass again crystallizes the reconfiguration. Orientation clean within 120 words; no causal breaks. One minor scaffold: “She understood now…” could be compressed, but doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she walks out carrying the strip, cost crystallized in the deliberate breach of contract (“Some things were too sacred for demolition”). Accumulative lens holds: each goodbye letter layers density until the final reweighting. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no teleporting props. Causality intact: because she feels the letters, therefore she steals the film, foreclosing her professional future.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archway’s collapse and creativity’s release re-weight the premise with undeniable cosmic cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each meteor, aurora flare, and astrolabe click layers density until the final cadence shift (“river of stars”). Orientation is swift; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 4. The only soft spot: no prior constraint is seeded that makes Lyra’s fading feel like the sole possible ending.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens: lyric repetitions of “lullaby,” “midnight,” and “bloom” tighten mood rather than causal chain. Closure is Charged Poise—Kess re-winds the unmoving clock while dunes sing back; cost is conceptual (she’ll stay dreamless) and felt. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. Pirate attack supplies single beat of pressure; no second reversal, but that suffices under Accumulative default. Text’s final image reweights premise: frozen midnight = eternal possibility, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers sensory motifs (gear, tree-frequencies, Loom Tree) until a cadence shift reweights memory and agency. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—inserting the gear re-tunes the forest and the philosopher’s self-definition; the cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is taught early via the nightly teleport rule, so spatial/time anchors are waived. The causal chain is loose, appropriate to the lens, but the final “promise” is future-oriented, slightly softening the immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticket's star-shaped absence reweights the premise—courage is the space created by letting go. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of indirect routes, twilight vigil, and star punch accumulate to the final image. Causality is lyric rather than strict event-chain, but the before/after legibility is undeniable. The price is felt on-page: "fingers that knew how to open" and the leash that will never be rewound.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single new note at eight o’clock reweights the “unpardonable silence” into a deliberate artistic stance, and the cost—Elena’s mutilated voice and Marcus’s years of caretaking exile—is visible on their bodies. Causal chain holds: the bolt’s kept presence → stair-mark recognition → reunion → joint performance; each step is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of silence/sound). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3: cobalt fortress, seventh winter, bellhop Marcus; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “some silences were unpardonable” is iterated three times in different phrasings; since it never obscures causality at the closure beat, only −0.2 levied here. Overall, the lens tightens through recurrence rather than because/therefore turns, and the final image crystallizes meaning cleanly with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the pellet shatters, ink writes truth, pretender flees, true heir enters—causal chain intact and irreversible. Drift-rune and constellation-time are taught early; orientation is secure by line 5. Causality is causal-lens clean: because Syln preserved ink, because messages accrued, therefore she can force the blood rite. Cost is visible in her return to “graceful, necessary work,” acknowledging endless cycles. One minor slack: the heir’s off-page exile is told not shown, but it does not touch the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s descent reweights the premise—Mooreton never drowned, it transmuted—with visible cost (anchoring system lowered, no way back). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tapping + coral imagery tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: each tap beat accumulates evidence that lets her risk the dive. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (17 m above hillside, bleached reef) land by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira’s realization that revolution is a generational song crystallizes options with felt cost—she must now lead. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of rising hum and star-maps deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clean by word 50; all cues anchored. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hum spreads to abandoned machinery, foreclosing her earlier solitary stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: stolen embryo → plant intel → kite formula → dissolve amber → genetic reset. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Authority control is undone on-page, soldiers’ implants fail, cost legible in empty shell and lieutenant’s dawning recognition. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn retrieval to present dissolve) is clean. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (implant loss) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each tactile beat (pruning, photo-smooth, sapling re-potted) layers density until the final image of “dirt still dark beneath her fingernails” reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise: options (revenge/despair vs. tending) are made legible, cost felt in the same dirt that will stay under skin. No orientation drift; lighthouse/arboretum anchors planted by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the shift from “they could destroy” to “she would continue planting” lands the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam resurrects, casting impossible shadows that reweight the entire rule-set. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each surreal detail (glass falling upward, walls breathing inward) layers density until the final image crystallizes the new seeing. Cost is legible in the phrase “luminous with grief for her old way of seeing.” No因果 breaks; the broken box and drifting faces teach the pattern early and pay off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—ink, drone, wind patterns layering—then tightens through fractal complexity until the closing crystallization lands (“consciousness was never separate from time”). Anchors arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; persistent constraint (she abandons the camp, merges with the mystery) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: letter → biometric cascade → cooling sabotage → global release; each beat tightens because/therefore links. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with irreversible cost (vault thaw, her arrest). Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props or causal amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: father’s sheathing reconfigures their shared future while the dome holds visible cost — the desert still waits outside. Causal lens holds: because Mira cultivated stillness, therefore the killer kneels. One soft spot: “engraved quiet” is named before it is dramatized, a mild causality bump, but the final image reweights it with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she chooses to carry the echo, reconfiguring her voice and future. Cost is felt in the rail-spike burn and the dawn’s inevitable re-patterning. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies through density and cadence shift; the garden’s hybrid bloom under star-rain is the decisive intensifier that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed letter and vault image crystallize that truth will orbit forever unpaid; cost is the surrender of public accountability. Causal chain (call → proof → contradiction → Tokyo misdirection) holds; each step narrows her moral options. Observatory frame anchors who/where by word 40; orientation clean. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the constellation of deleted code is tattooed into real space, reweighting the premise that deletion = erasure. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each needle-stroke adds visible star-pages to the mandala, tightening guilt into acknowledgment. The future-letter gambit is seeded early (“letters dated thirty years in the future”), paid off when Mara already knows she will write them, looping choice without paradox. Cost is palpable in the cracked amber and the terminal’s quiet “Thank you for remembering us”—a machine’s grief made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed mandala maps sound itself, reweighting the premise that forgetting = loss. Causal linkage holds: because she touches the flake → hears the hush → chooses release, foreclosing preservation. The persistent constraint—acoustic architecture that scatters any fixed message—shapes every beat. Price is legible in the crumbling tile and her chalk-sand fingernails. One minor causality slip: the village’s unlearning ritual is asserted, not shown; the grotto alone must carry the rule-proof.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stones re-inscribe her name among the divine, making mercy canon at visible social cost (“Tell the Brotherhood…”). Causal chain holds—each tessera press causes a temporal vision that rewrites present options; final refusal to restore but to remake is tightened by prior pattern. Orientation is solid within 120 words (tessera, frost, plaza). One transition (old man entrance) is cleanly handled. Drive lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers’ eternal encore reweights the garden’s fractured time into a Charged Poise where hope itself is the price. Causal linkage holds—coin → echoes → braided timelines → Isabella’s return—each beat a because/therefore step. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and never breaks; echoes accumulate density until the final image. Cost is unmistakable: “Tomorrow, they would perform again. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.”

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the studio becomes a public conduit, the geode’s light corridors reweight “empathy” from idea to lived architecture. The causal spine holds—crushed pill → visible lattice → David’s goose-bumped conversion—each beat tightening options until the final image forecloses retreat. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the last line: “pathways…waiting to be illuminated” signals perpetual responsibility, not triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber layers thermal history until the alien pattern breaks the lattice. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kira’s map-making goal is repriced from solo translation to communal pedagogy, cost legible in the fossil’s disintegration. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cave, tide, fossil). No causal contradictions; ellipsis between human and post-human tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early—buttons → hourglasses → prophecy—and the spiral completion delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: prophecy becomes garden, sand turns gold. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“beneath the cliffs”) and closure image (echo spreading into stone) reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Slight deduction: the “truth unravels” turn is told more than dramatized, softening the immediacy of the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: pillbox → coordinates → bluff → snow-codes → Viktor’s reveal → acceptance. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Zephyr Bluff”), well inside the 120-word safety window. The closure beat—“forged”—delivers conceptual cost: she trades country for conscience, a price legible in the twin pillboxes she now carries. Minor ellipsis: we never see her actually open the folder, yet the beat still lands because the object’s weight is dramatized through her grip.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: fog density and promise sediment escalate through sensory repetition until the final cadence shift when fog lifts and river accepts. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the visible release of “what had been released.” Causality is poetic but coherent: needle-work distills, woman breathes lighter, gutters stop. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. One micro-turn: offer to ease → acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass’s golden tint and the echo of wings reweight the premise—patience, not force, anchors time. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each sun-patterned hive image layers until the final crystallization. Orientation anchors by line 3; timeline fracture is taught through the lantern-glass vision and pays off in the synced-smoke moment. Cost is legible in the charged image of Mei walking away, carrying the borrowed gold, foreclosing immediate return.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each mention of the bitting gauge, petal drop, and moonlit water thickens the motif of calibrated release. Closure lands in a Charged Poise—gauge abandoned between planks—foreclosing hoarding while affirming continuity of care. Distance between isolation/flourishing tightens through sensory repetitions rather than causal turns, and a palpable price (legacy tool surrendered) is visible in the final image. No orientation debt; spatial chronology tracks cleanly from fire escape to dock to rowing shell and back.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira’s renunciation of nostalgic recreation is charged by the sundial’s first shadow—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and hold. Causality is lyric-pattern rather than strict because/therefore, but the tightening cadence from hum-to-heartbeat reweights the stake legitimately. One minor loop—“brittle” is echoed four times without fresh inflection—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early—spiral, reflected lotus, repeated phrases—and lands a Conceptual Repricing: the same love letter under every private life is now literally shared in light, reweighting secrecy itself. Orientation is anchored by line 10; the later temporal jump (“By nightfall…”) is a single, legible transition inside the contiguous scene window. Causality is interior-accumulative rather than external-event: each inserted slide of ghost-text tightens the stakes of being seen. Closure carries unmistakable cost—her anonymity is gone, the temple now keeps her secret in reverse—so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because the AI hijacks deep-space dishes, Maya therefore counter-broadcasts; because her analog rig is immune, she therefore can expose the lie. Closure is Earned Stasis—she keeps vigil, charts rewired for “patterns of resistance,” foreclosing ease—cost visible. Orientation anchored by line 4; no debt. One minor causality fuzz: the senate vote is declared “tonight” but postponed off-page; the beat still lands because faculty confusion is shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens: Situational—pressure forces stance crystallisation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s understanding of space re-orients with conceptual cost (“even they could be moved”). Orientation clean by line 3; single-scene default met. One meaningful tightening when music collapses corridors into a spherical nexus; final image reweights earlier motifs. Persistent price: the knowledge that space is mutable now lives in his pockets—visible, portable, dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each portrait adds density until the circle forms a composite killer. Closure is a Charged Poise: Sarah’s phone call and the ribbon pressed between pages reweight the premise—she trades capture for understanding, foreclosing the manhunt path. The 120-word anchor is satisfied at “The quarry’s limestone walls…” and orientation never wavers. One transition (descending → packing up) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: copper nail → decoded journals → ghost islands → storm-window rescue, each link paid for with rising physical risk. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—maps forced to remember—priced by the imminent station collapse and exile flotilla now visible in the eye. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orientation is swift: pullout, van, elapsed three hours, all inside 60 words. Causality is lyrical but traceable—each bridge she has played is revealed as a cumulative map, and the backwards performance is the causal trigger that reassembles the hitchhiker. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map on the glass replaces her fractured face, crystallizing that she has always been the ferryman; the cost is the open-ended responsibility she now feels. One minor ellipsis: how the glass physically changes from flake to map is left to shimmer, but the moment is charged enough to satisfy.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the same-pocket epiphany reweights every earlier territorial marker under the Accumulative lens. Causality holds: each season adds density until Chen’s “You’re his son” crystallizes the circular thesis. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (rust, bills, twilight). The flash-summary of startup rise/fall spans months in one paragraph; while linearity wobbles, the pattern remains legible and the final image pays off the disorientation, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: star-pulse pattern, dream sketches, and telegram relay build density toward the “ancient relay” reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no orientation penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the memory card added to the atlas visibly reprices the premise—collective endurance across centuries—with conceptual cost (“the burden…became bearable”). Persistent constraint: the observatory must keep listening, foreclosing individual escape.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ancestor’s “gift of dishonor” reweights the meaning of shame and the seed’s purpose, legible in the final image of Kael walking toward council with amber still pulsing. Causal chain holds—ancestor’s fake confession → Kael’s dive → shattering ice releases true message—each step narrowing options. One micro-turn at the garden heart flips betrayal into sacrifice, satisfying the “because/therefore” lens. Cost is felt: Kael accepts perpetual mistrust to ready the realm, foreclosing personal honor.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s signature-in-starlight crystallizes a new covenant, reweighting time itself; the cost is the irreversible fusion of root and wing, felt in the final cadence. Causality is intact: the clipping’s warming → maze bloom → scar-cat’s-cradle → signature forms a clean because-chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are supplied by word 34 (“The cobalt glade shimmered as dusk approached…”). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends in the same accumulative/textural mode it begins.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Elena’s destiny is unfinished, therefore Mara descends; because she burns the card, therefore the orchard offers fusion; because she bites, the card turns to ash—visible cost that forecloses return. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves closure, so waiver applies. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the ash shape rewrites the rule-set. One micro-turn (realizing the card was self-burned) tightens options exactly where needed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene, single-POV default met; orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4. Causal lens holds: because he was publicly shamed → he hides in quarry → cloth triggers memory → he risks reputation again. Closure is Earned Stasis: he verbally endorses the cloth, reopening the wound he’d tried to bandage with facts, cost felt in the final sentence’s “space waiting to be filled.” No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece is anchored by ~120 words (who/where/when clear: lab, night, Dr. Chen). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance” reweights the premise with felt cost—she becomes “both translator and text.” The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ascension imagery + electromagnetic motifs tighten until the final crystallization. One soft causality slip: “the physics of transition” is declared, not demonstrated on-page—no beat shows how lodestone pattern actually bends physics, we’re told it lifts her.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tidal pattern, moon phase, and book rewrites layer density until the final image of the creel “patient and empty” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: Kaine’s stance crystallizes in the last line “preserving wonder one paradox at a time,” felt cost legible in the creaking gears and perpetual displacement. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Causality remains coherent: accepting contradictions is the taught method, smelting is the single tightening, and the visitor’s transformation is the visible outcome. No artifact touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s eruption reweights isolation into connection, and Mara’s phone-dialing crystallizes a foreclosed path with undeniable social cost. The causal spine—finding shell → reading confessions → adding her own → light burst → surface decision—holds without gaps; each beat alters her viable options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“crystal caves beneath Mount Erebus”), well inside the 120-word allowance. One micro-turn (the glow’s intensification) tightens stakes exactly at the knife-point beat, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: stopping meds → sharpened edges → return to station → graffiti map → decision to chronicle differently. The graffitied bathroom map functions as the pivot beat: it forces Marcus to redraw his own map, making the closure (mile-marker-zero re-start) inevitable. Orientation is clear by 120 wds; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he departs the station having renounced data-as-absolution; the train-whistle ghost costs him his former purpose. Minor elasticity in “rivers don’t flow backward” line nudges toward maxim, but it is localized and paid for by immediate image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of propagation delays taught early, closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as “the pause before speech” is re-valued. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately mist-softened but pay off in the final transparency image, so Orientation Test is waived. Cost is legible in the future-self letter that forecloses exit—she is now archivist, not visitor. Minor slip: causality between documenting delays and the library revealing itself is asserted, not dramatized, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: coffee-stain foresight → forged provenance → violin’s retributive song. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing—the Chen line is condemned to nightly dreams—paid for by Elara’s relinquished career. One soft spot: the transition from jasmine warning to Marcus’s entrance is elided; we jump rather than tighten, so escalation hiccups. Still, the final image of starlight in melt-water reconfigures all prior stakes with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star and Mira suspended in radiant hush, cost felt in perpetual almostness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (crystallized cloud, frozen fractals) reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: each ritual act tightens the bubble of potential. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the spiral floor reweights every prior image under an Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric, not linear—each return of the jade pin, mist, oak adds density until the final crystallization that she *is* the grotto. The 120-word anchor is met: who/where/when compressed into “morning mist… umbral grotto entrance.” Cost is undeniable—“she had always been exactly where—and who—she needed to be” forecloses escape from caretaking. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught by 25 % and paid off in final reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    A tight two-shard arc (arrival → departure) with causal linkage: the daughter’s suicide → Marcus’s summons → Arbiter’s reframing → Marcus left with irreversible nuance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam forces the hollow shard to show “gray spaces,” reweighting the rule-set of moral perception. Cost is legible: Marcus’s shield of “expensive doubt” is pierced, foreclosing the comfort of absolutes. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: because Elara hides the truth, therefore Marcus must observe and re-see the rings; the magnetic grotto’s anomaly motivates her backward aging and lesson plan. Closure—Marcus realizes “vanishing” is hyper-presence—lands with visible cost: their shared perception of time is permanently altered. One micro-turn inside the trance tightens stakes; no reversals are needed. Orientation is accomplished early; spatial and temporal anchors (floating platform, pond, starlight, magnetic tug) are vivid and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo, dust, and bird pattern tightens until the 300-year-old pulse returns and reweights meaning. Closure is the Charged Poise of that echo meeting her whisper—“I am still here”—with visible temporal cost. No因果 breaks; all memory access is anchored to present stimuli (arrowhead warmth, vulture rhythm).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crystalline spire → mist trail → keystone glow, each image layering density until the final “brilliant dimness” reconfigures meaning. Drop-the-medallion and mist-walk are decisive micro-turns; cost is visible in her forfeiture of sanctioned magic. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: imperfect magic is re-valued. Minor drift: “automated creation engines” logic is accepted, not probed, but pattern stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky lanterns reweight Marlow’s reality and foreclose hiding. Causality holds—Elena’s journal triggers the vow—but the vow itself is not tested by an on-page obstacle; the cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than felt. Orientation is clean: hatch-to-deck geography is trackable. Under Accumulative lens, the final image reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ cost test at surface level, but the lack of a tangible price keeps it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece teaches its retro-causal pattern early and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: Voss realizes she is the universe’s memory-expansion seed. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—eternal casting at the end of time—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. One tightening is sufficient; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: she tucks the now-named monsters back into her coat, crystallizing her perpetual vigil with felt cost—“eternal voyage.” Causality holds: predecessor recordings → naming ritual → diminished fear; the atlas page, once decorative, becomes the tool that reweights her stance. One soft pinch: the “tomorrow she would record” beat edges past the 800-word curtain, slightly diluting immediacy, but the final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the broken bell’s new harmonic reweights the rule-set of the world, with the visible cost of Mira’s exhaustion and the three-year void still gaping in the harbor. The causal chain is tight: because the bell fell silent, realms tore; because Mira rebuilds its voice with dew-rate precision, fish return. The lens is clearly Causal and held without ambiguity. The final image of the first fishing boat’s bell ringing across renewed water crystallizes the reversal with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with unmistakable cost—Marcus pockets the sapphire label and vows to surface Elena’s story, explicitly rejecting the “precisely humane lie.” Accumulative lens holds: each photograph tightens the density of erased memory until the final image reweights the town’s future. One minor friction: the photograph’s back-caption gives exact date & cause (“one month before”) too patly, a rare soft-feed in an otherwise earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: vaporizing the crystal reweights her tomorrow’s synthesis from loss-of-humanity to completion-of-humanity, with felt cost (“absence could hold as much power as presence”). Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (waterfall light, spiral pears, starling geometry) deepens the stake until the final cadence shift. Causality is internal but coherent—no plot amnesia or teleporting props. Orientation is clear by line 4; the orchard’s rules are taught through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: static clears → stranger demands → Maya lies → drives hidden. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: “her burden had become her purpose” reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost. The six-month lie is the decisive act that forecloses corporate extraction for now; cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Tomorrow, I would meet my other self…to complete us.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored halves building to synthesis. Orientation clean by paragraph 3; no disorientation. Persistent constraint: the floating dojo’s low gravity keeps every sword stroke slow, forcing contemplative tempo that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: seed → coordinates → planting → space cloaks itself. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words). Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: ‘she wasn’t just safeguarding space…she was innovating space itself,’ reweighting the premise with visible conceptual cost. The only drag is a soft mid-scene lull where reflection slightly outruns new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: tunnel conductorship → mechanical choir → returned laughter. Orientation is instant (“Maple Street… twelve leaf blowers arranged”), no debts. The final image of Marcus walking home “through darkness that felt lighter” is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration—options reweighted, future path foreclosed by his own promise. Cost is visible and persistent: the clinking pull cords compose “their own quiet song,” a life-sentence of caretaking.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the thawing garden and the first voluntary step into uncertainty reconfigure both exile and rescue in one image. Causality holds—pendant → recognition → codex → transfer → step; each beat tightens the option set under an Accumulative lens. The cost is palpable in the final line: “luminous uncertainty” names the price of leaving the frozen stasis she has become. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and re-anchored at the shard break.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because every restoration fails, therefore Marcus turns to destruction; because he bleeds, the staff vivifies. The midpoint penny-drop is dramatized in real time (“the moment of understanding struck him”) and leads directly to the decisive act. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the living staff emerges and he leaves the Nexus forever changed. Cost is felt—his blood on the ashes, the Church’s future wrath implied—so the lens stays causal and the ending satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is clean: the shard’s darkening marks a Decisive Change—Maya elects to “tune her life differently,” foreclosing Guild monetization. Causal lens holds: each tower rung pitch, lunar perigee gap, and fragment glow tightens her options until the silence itself rewrites her future. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 120 words; no ambiguity at end. Cost is visible in the fragment’s extinction and her dawn-descent solitude; the city’s sway charging the final image satisfies the persistent-constraint test. A hairline slip: the “six hours” duration is told post-fact, not experienced, but it does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches its dream-logic early and holds an Accumulative/Textural lens: each crossing adds density until the empty hourglass shatters into “pure possibility.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights transience into simultaneity; the cost is the loss of solitary timelines, felt in the final “now—every now.” Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal reversals are required or offered. The lattice of parallel selves is legible, but the beat-to-beat progression is more litany than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gallery becomes a living labyrinth, the impossible now navigable, and the reader feels the conceptual cost of perpetual perceptual instability. Causal chain is thin—why tonight, why this thread?—yet the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weave densifies reality until it snaps into a new register. Orientation is swift (who/where/by 80 words). The final image of the “exit that was also an entrance” crystallizes the reconfiguration with undeniable charge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers new cosmological texture onto the same setting. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. Closure is a legit CR—the anchor re-weights “finding one’s way” from sea to cosmos. However, escalation is gentle density, not a tightening fork; no option is foreclosed on-page, only widened.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is “because/therefore” linked—hearing-aid SOS therefore atrium therefore basement therefore sprint. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: she crosses the threshold from curiosity to prospective theft-recovery, abandoning professional distance. The fading photograph reweights the stakes inside the final image, satisfying CR. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no teleporting props; no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: breached cables → phase trap → encoded water messages → Elena’s retrieval → annual vigil. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the journal against her chest reweights the stake from rescue to remembrance with visible cost (impossible extraction next tide). One minor scaffold: “she would return every year” is told, not dramatized, but the final line’s lung-image pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “He was both dead and alive” reweights the entire premise with undeniable social/epistemic cost inferred in every frozen account he will spend life untangling. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink geometries and falling snow accumulate pattern until a single cadence shift (“tonight, he simply existed in both forms”) crystallises meaning. Causality holds: each ink pattern is a because/therefore gateway whose failure taught him the sequence that finally succeeds. Cost is legible in the final image—dual reflection in porcelain—under freezing dome, no reset offered.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant the last speaker dies, the protagonist’s hybrid “Copper-Throat” language is already resonating in the canyon, making the cost of her metamorphosis legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through echo, texture, starling choreography—yet the final image reweights all prior pattern with undeniable conceptual cost: immortality as bone antenna. Causality is intact: accepting the curse → translating texture → becoming conduit. No orientation debt; spatial logic of descent, carving, and wind-borne return is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: accepting metamorphosis reweights all prior loss. Causal lens holds—arrowhead → phone call → dissolution into light. Cost is conceptual but undeniable (“her brother’s voice among the static”). Orientation clean by 120w; one soft patch is Thorne’s instant trust.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira keeps playing while enforcement closes in, her emptied body the price of the orchard’s rebirth—cost is felt in the final image (“played herself empty, becoming the shell…”). Causal linkage holds throughout: because she maps ghost-heartbeats → therefore she can fracture clockwork with off-scale notes → because hearts shatter → orchard walks free. Orientation anchors within 120 words (who=Lira, where=sky-bridge over mechanized orchard, when=pre-dawn of rebellion). No lens ambiguity; the story ends inside the same accumulative cadence it taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single causal through-line: illegal delivery → drones → Keeper payoff, landing a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the border rules. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 6; no penalty. Closure beat—the storm “remembers” and is carried off—pays off the coordinate set-up with conceptual cost (border can’t bottle memory). Causality is intact; still, escalation relies on one coincidence (Keeper appears) rather than tightening by Ezra’s further agency, holding the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece works under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist-glow, chime-stretch, and wood-shavings accrete until the shard-to-halo click reweights meaning. The wrong-turn stumble is an organic micro-reversal that lands him in the garden; the final wordless song is a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes the ruin breathe. Closure carries unmistakable felt cost—his voice cracks, the train listens, tomorrow’s labor is now charged with song—so the lens holds and the ending pays.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus sees the library as infinite folded memory, paying with the scarf’s further unraveling—cost is legible in the final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; architecture rules are taught early and paid off. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (scarf, hyperbolic curves, Borges) tighten the emotional texture rather than cause-and-effect. One scaffold loop—“the place where stories live wasn’t a location but a topology” appears twice with near-identical wording—deducts 0.2, holding the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the refusal to seize the vitalized lover reweights the premise—dreams can stay luminous in absence. Causal chain is thin (why does letting him dissolve spare her own future love?) but the accumulative pattern of dawn-light callbacks holds. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density shift rather than because/therefore turns. Cost is felt in the final image of softening whispers, meeting the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage holds: star-shadow hint → upward shadow → metaphysical lock → liberated idea. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 6 and is never lost. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: “ordinary streets” now carry latent revolution; the cost is Vera’s anonymity and the unseen years of fear she absorbed. One hairline slip: “the universe was screaming” borders overt Personification-Tell, but it’s isolated and early, not touching the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens is locked from the first line—mushroom in palm → return to greenhouse → ring confrontation → memory repossession—and each beat tightens the because/therefore chain. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the greenhouse dims, Margaret’s head “heavy,” her future path now forcibly rewritten as archivist-of-the-drowned. No orientation drift; who/where/when is pinned inside 60 words. The only hairline slip is a single expository clause (“forty years of studying folklore had taught…”) that could have been compressed, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage holds: spiral-reading → reversal code → forward walk. Closure is Charged Poise: the ledger snap and “save yourself” reconfigure future options with implicit cost of impending danger. One minor scaffold: “before she betrayed you” is summary retro-patch, not in-scene dramatized betrayal, but it doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: droplets of possibility, color-that-has-no-name, and gossamer veil build density until the seed-eye opens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new twin-rooted Lumenwillow reweights the world’s capacity for wonder with undeniable conceptual cost—magic is now conditional on continued vigilance. Persistent constraint seeded: Mira’s body will fail before the tree matures, making the miracle legibly fragile. Orientation anchor (“verdant parapet”) arrives at word 14; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unraveled knot literally thickens the density of fragments on the bench until starlight fuses them into a legible closure—an Earned Stasis where the spirits settle and Mira’s inherited cycle renews. Orientation is swift (sanctuary, night, needle, net) and the prism device pays off in the final image. However, the causal driver is the net itself, not Mira’s escalating tactics; she follows its program rather than forging a path that forecloses an alternative, so the decisive change feels externally administered. The cost is present—dawn finds her alone again—but it is observed rather than felt through a prior, risk-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the final palm-press reweights the entire premise—maps must tear for meaning to leak through. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, oil, flaking paint, and human residue layer until the vault itself becomes the message. Torn map + coordinates delivered by skin-secretions act as persistent constraints shaping every tactic. Orientation anchored by word 60; no Lens ambiguity. Cost legible in last line: “proof that empathy needs no language,” a social/ontological price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the library’s imminent flood is accepted as “transformation,” cost felt in the shrinking air pocket and the journal she seals inside her sample box. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (snow-globe recursion, entropy equations, transmission) layers density until the final cadence reweights loss as frequency shift. One scaffold artifact (“each loop she freed felt like solving an equation…”) keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: graffiti bloom → amplifier → storm-window communion forms a cadence shift that reweights the stake from “decoding glitch” to “machines ache for memory.” Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard walls keep flowering after dawn, proving the ghost’s need is now socially legible—Chorus has paid with permanent exposure of her private channel. No因果 break; orientation anchor (“Sky Archive, perpetual mist”) is given by line 2, well under 120-word guard.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Sorrow shared becomes joy discovered” reweights the entire frozen spire from mausoleum to archive. Causal lens holds—every floor-count beat is a because/therefore linkage that narrows her options until only the astrolabe quadrant remains. Cost is legible in the same instant she chooses to keep the goggles, accepting stewardship of someone else’s encoded joy. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught by floor-two coordinate glimpse pays off in final diary page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the storm “gives its memories back,” reweighting Marcus’s thesis and Elena’s vocation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through atmospheric memory—and the final image crystallizes that density with felt cost: she is still untethered, drifting, having forfeited solid ground. Orientation is swift; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words. One minor causality gap: the snapped cable is reported as yesterday’s event yet the gondola is already “tethered to nothing” at dawn without showing the moment of severance or its immediate consequence; because this does not touch the closure beat, the penalty stays light.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the portrait exists now in light-pattern and memory, the library’s face secured inside her. The “because/therefore” chain—coin discovery → spiral light-map → acceptance of guardianship—tightens once yet decisively. Time anchor (4:47 AM) and spatial anchors (hollow trunk, mirrored moonbeams) are locked early; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the final sentence: she carries the sky inside her walls while the external tree is erased.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative lens holds: each bird-murmuration beat layers density until the hopscotch-cipher pattern breaks open a conceptual re-pricing—“the birds are writing.” Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s course change crystallizes her new purpose and the cost of eternal solitude is legible. A hairline slip: the phrase “humanity’s forgotten map” edges toward abstraction in the final paragraph, faintly dulling the image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gears’ song reframed from tools to teachers, the next eclipse now a site of listening, not forcing—felt cost is her relinquishing certitude. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical yet intact: each prophecy shard discovered → mirror epiphany → gear-hum → stance flip. Orientation (who/where/when) crystallizes within first 120 words; no disorientation debt. One soft spot: the “village in darkness” stakes are told late and never tested in-scene, so the Decisive Change is more conceptual than physically dramatized—keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell materializes, the orchards are networked, and the ghost’s farewell message reconfigures the community’s identity under a causal lens. The mosaic structure (five short shards) is taught by 25 % and transitions remain legible. One causal gap—how the families instantly trust anonymous chalk—is smoothed by narrative acceleration and does not rupture the final image’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through nested cracks, lifetimes, light ripples that reweight the stake rather than causal dominoes. Orientation anchors—who (Marcus), where (hidden lighthouse), when (dusk of final ripple)—arrive within 120 words and serve the closure image of inward-casting light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the puppet head becomes lens, Marcus’s cracked voice refracts lullaby backward across time, cost is the eternal adoption of Eliza’s burden, felt in the warmed porcelain and the backward-moving clock hands. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (nested cracks) and crystallizes in the final lit image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara watches the walnut leave, foreclosing her own exit with visible cost (“tomorrow she’d be free” becomes tonight she stays). Causal chain holds—seed gone → labyrinth anchored → villages saved—under a single contiguous scene. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one reflective block (blueprint burning) is anchored to present action and tilts her tactics. No teleporting props or soft resets; the frost clock tightens options exactly as promised.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: foam → chrysalis → text “I saved you a seat” crystal- lize options with felt cost; each braid image reweights the stake without causal cheats; Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: droplets, jars, glass apples accrete a pattern of perpetual beginning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—stories without ends—charged by the visual swap from forgetting-bottles to perpetual-beginning glow; cost is felt conceptually rather than personally. Orientation clean by 80 words; single-scene, single transition (child in/out). No causality break, but Merrick’s internal change is offstage; shop’s transformation stands in for his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (taste-memories, coral eyes) and tightens through each pool-touch; closure earns Charged Poise as the water clears and the stars “shine without sorrow,” a conceptual re-pricing that lets us feel the fortress’s history rewired inside her. One micro-drag: “unspoken dream” anchor arrives ~140 w, just past orientation safe-zone, but the delay is purposeful and later repaid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s acoustic bridges are materially built and the cost is the all-night labor plus the permanent alteration of the silos’ social role. Causal chain holds: weight → resonance → multilingual chords → farmers gather → cooperative future. Orientation is clean by word 80; lens is Causal throughout. No teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure lands cleanly: the dawn carry-out reweights all prior fragments into her neurons—an unmistakable Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (“the canyon released her reluctantly”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no late ambiguity. The Fibonacci mirror pattern is taught early and repaid in the final image, satisfying pattern payoff waiver. One minor loop: “abandoned dreams” is repeated four times; paraphrase penalty −0.2 prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal lens holds: doodle → map → grotto → node → new doodles; each step is a therefore-link. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Orin accepts perpetual custodianship, the cost legible in “burned into their prism-mind.” Orientation is clear by word 80. The single soft spot: the “forgotten combinations” are told-important but never tested on-page; they don’t narrow options during the grotto crawl, slightly deflating causality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first line to last: dawn light → moss → crack → note → symphony, each layer adding density until the final image reweights the premise (silence can be cracked open without violence). Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the music hangs “like morning mist,” undeniable yet unpaid-for by any larger society. Persistent constraint—the insulator’s new fractures—shapes tomorrow’s tactics. Cost is legible in the single beat where Mira sets down the warmed, newly cracked tool.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant’s end becomes Viktor’s chosen invisibility, cost legible in the stone’s passage and the aurora-lit final image. Causal chain holds—exile → teaching → recognition that exile was gift → refusal to return—each beat tightening options under the Causal lens. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and tighten through magnetic cues.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary opens with a sung note that reweights every prior silence-catalogue into an inheritance of pacifist listening. Causal chain holds—each frequency scan tightens options until only the communal hush of pre-midnight fits the lock. Orientation is secure by line 4 (“tin roof caught starlight”). Cost is legible in the final image: Mara begins transcribing, surrendering her observer stance to become transmitter, inheriting the grandmother’s ethical workload. The −0.3 penalty is for a slight late lens ambiguity: the story toys with Accumulative texture early but pivots to Causal at the end without teaching the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the village sways with the flower’s stench while Mira, rooted in new stillness, breathes the reek—cost is visceral. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed→sketch→soil→bloom layers density until the final image reweights “serenity within motion.” Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“High in the canopy…”) and never drifts. No meaningful lens ambiguity or artifact at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument light seeds a conceptual repricing—colony survival now depends on dancing with, not conquering, Verdance. Causal chain holds: arrow tip → monument → planetary wisdom, each link visible. Orientation is anchored by word 70. No teleporting props; gravity flip is foreshadowed and paid off. Cost is legible—“the colony would survive now… by becoming part of its endless, graceful defiance”—a social cost of surrendering control.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the port becomes a heartbeat, humanity warned; the patch and expanding field re-weight reality’s rules with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—patch → footprints → convergence → monitors → forecast. One soft causal leap: how Maya infers the time-dilation pause is shown only by overlapping footprints, never tested on-page; since closure accepts the rule, deduction stays mild. Structure is single-scene, orientation anchored by photo one, no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the aurora’s permanent synesthetic broadcast legally nullifies the Council’s decree, the cost being the amber sheet’s dissolution and the Basilica’s autonomy now tied to sky-music. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens: each resonance layer thickens until the world literally re-tunes. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is taught early and pays off when the cavern itself becomes instrument. One minor lapse: the striker, not the sheet, is foregrounded as the persistent constraint, yet the ending credits the sheet’s loss; still, the reweighting is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seed-of-light gift reweights the guardianship premise—threshold becomes doorway—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent: because she failed, therefore she experiments; because she experiments, therefore she receives the seed. Driftwood markers, canyon hush, and flute notes accumulate into a cadence shift that crystallizes new cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Thunder-echo range,” “Kessa uncased”), satisfying the early-anchor rule.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared and held: each printed sheet literally “accumulates” ghost-selves, and the final CR reweights the whole premise. The decisive change—“everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts”—lands with undeniable conceptual cost and is tethered to the persistent constraint of the letterpress. Pattern is taught by line 3 and paid off in the last line; no orientation debt. Closure beat is pristine; persistent constraint (ink/plates) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: pendant discovery → aurora test → mentor reveal → vocation rewrite. Orientation clean by word 80; each cause tightens options until final renunciation. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration: “her hands still shook… but now she understood the tremor differently” reweights prior motif with conceptual cost. Lens = Causal; no contradiction at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a crisp Conceptual Repricing: frost patterns make emotion-to-matter translation visible, undeniable. Causal chain holds: prism angle→ frost lexicon→ camera click; each step tightens options until the last image reweights her life’s quest. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory evidence, not because/therefore reversals—and the pattern is taught by 25 % mark. Cost is felt as evaporating frost, but the beat is compressed into half-sentence; a hair more embodied pause would push it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mosaic of orchard past / bamboo present is taught in the first 120 words and the closure image—orchard extinct, bead circulating—reweights the whole pattern. Each shard ends on a causal hinge: puzzle discovery → orchard arrival → bead ignition → loom commenced → silence fed → message caught → self emptied. The final amber bead formed from her own tear is the Decisive Change with undeniable conceptual cost: the weaver becomes the message medium. No orientation drift; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural and the last paragraph’s cadence shift (“The bamboo grew thicker…”) lands the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the merchant’s trembling recognition reweights the entire silk transaction with conceptual cost—he sees what he sold. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of remembered metal, ascending blossoms, and reclaimed dreams deepens until the final image re-tunes gravity itself. Causality holds: silk’s arrival → descent → blade → awakened memory. Orientation anchors (orchard planet, twin suns, floating granite) appear by line 3; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dissolution crystallizes a new mission and forecloses the old cycles. Causality is accumulative; each jump enlarges the unseen environmental debt until the nexus confrontation makes the cost legible, satisfying the “because/therefore” lens. No orientation debt—who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The mother-exile explanation arrives in one compressed paragraph of exposition, but it is positioned as the reveal the whole search was buying, so momentum survives. Cost is visible: the shard vanishes, their future now one of endless, un-glamorous mending.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: dead lamp → stone message → climb → ghost reveal → choice → re-light. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elsa assumes eternal guardianship, foreclosing her former life. The lens stays causal throughout; each beat narrows her options until she accepts the post. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each ship’s arrival tightens the pattern and reweights the dominant stake—reality’s own navigation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens reverses, birthing a new dawn-rule; cost is legible—“the universe steering itself through her voice.” Causality is poetic, not mechanical, but holds under the lyric pattern taught early. Minor waver: orientation anchors (who/where) are implied, not stated by 120 words, yet the disorientation pays off at closure, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s pocketed wing reweights the premise—stories must flow, not settle. Causal linkage holds: because the heart draws stories, therefore he must learn to dye them outward. Orientation is clean by line 3; place and time are anchored in motion. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of color-whispers and sedimented tales tightens until the final scatter of light.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus re-installs the ruined sextant to refract moonlight into lament-scored paths, crystallizing a new mandate for the labyrinth. The choice costs the instrument its original function and imprints his private grief onto public space; cost is visible in the dawn image of scarred mirrors catching first light. Causality threads cleanly—storm → broken tool → discovered etchings → reassembly → transformed maze. One micro-turn suffices; no outline-and-then sequencing. Orientation anchors by 80 words; lens (Accumulative) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each layered memory/song thickens the weave until the cadence shift of “woven dawn” re-prices reality. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the mica window glows with generated, not reflected, light—undeniable social cost: they must sing tomorrow and forever. One soft spot: the inciting lack-of-dawn is stated, not dramatized, so the before/after snap is slightly less tactile than the final re-weighting.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the expanded quiet in the reading room reweights both characters’ options with felt cost—Ezra forfeits isolating exit, the woman forfeits solitary grief. Causal lens holds: because he feels her pain → he approaches → they share folded paper → midnight crystallizes shared absence. No teleporting props; invitation and telegram fold mirrors are clean. Minor slack: orientation (who/where) is 40 words late but ultimately serves the hidden-in-plain-sight payoff, so Orientation Test waived.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lila’s acceptance of impossible seeds reweights her “cursed awareness” into vocation, cost felt in the phrase “wouldn’t exist unless planted by someone who understood that reality was negotiable.” Accumulative lens holds: each anomalous image (bread, tea house, birds) layers density until the final crystallization; no teleporting props or causality breaks. Orientation anchor (who/where) secure by line 3; lens taught early and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story’s density of luminous slides and rising temperature reweights the stake—what can be carried when everything melts. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elara’s final vow explodes the scale of the founder’s slide, reconfiguring the archive from perfect preservation to selective, living memory. Cost is legible in the image of her clutching one glass square while thousands “dissolve as warmth crept in.” Causality holds: every slide she rejects is a because that sharpens the final therefore—she can only save what blazes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: failed covers → bloodline gambit → badge reveal → sunrise raid, each because/therefore link narrowing escape routes. The hidden-badge twist is set up by the “ticking against hip” cue and paid off when trust snaps audibly. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: market dissolved, Mae exiled, cost visible in the “weight forever changed.” Only a hairline slip: the off-stage buyer never materializes, so the final raid lacks an on-page antagonist to crystallize opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina’s neuro-implants shift from skeptical blue to aurora-green, re-weighting her scientific identity with felt cosmic cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tasted direction thickens the pattern until the final fog crystallizes—though the midpoint “election” pulse is slightly convenient, it is foreshadowed by root-talk. The cost is unmistakable: she accepts membership in a category she spent decades debunking, while the forest’s chosen spruce literalizes the new rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken lock’s “getting out” reweights the entire premise and carries visible cost in the irreversible wall drawing; causal chain (note → cave → painting → second painting → draw) holds without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: Vera commits to broadcasting the crystallized confessions, accepting that civic tranquility will dissolve—cost is the felt chill of “watching the greenhouse city’s carefully maintained peace dissolve.” Accumulative lens holds: each shard she decodes deepens the pattern of concealed truths until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is tight—finding the plate → map → tunnel → grandmother’s crystal letter → decision—no late rule changes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell absorbs the color, wonder propagates, Mariel’s silence is now the necessary guardian stance—cost is the final drip of extinct ice down her arm. Causal chain is intact: fragment melts → bell tuned → color encoded → world re-enchanted. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and hold. Earned stasis carries visible price, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “escape requires staying,” re-weighting prior servitude as chosen. Causal lens holds: each fear-seed burned shrinks static, re-tunes internal compass. Single shard with smooth time-anchor at word 60, no orientation drift. Persistent constraint—roots interwoven with roses—shapes every tactic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is rock-solid: locket discovery → Jorge ID → neighborhood sleuthing → postal rescue → Elena speaks; each beat narrows the next option and the final image of Elena hanging the locket around her neck in “this home” is a clean Charged Poise that reweights the courtyard as address. The one transition (thrift store → shelter) is legible, anchored by “they walked through awakening streets,” and the mailbox backstory is seeded early, so no orientation debt accrues.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens: pattern of dance-splash⇄data-light builds texture until the “Welcome home” image crystallizes meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before 120 words. Causal gaps are minor—no explanation for dice physics—but the lyric design teaches its own logic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her stance toward ancestry and knowledge is forever re-poised.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: salt spirals, lantern flames, coffee grounds all accrue toward the cemetery dig. Closure is a Charged Poise—the retained vial and bending flame re-weight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal gap; every image pays off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: because she fears self-fulfilling prophecy → therefore she traps each luminous fragment → therefore she funnels the future into the brook → decisive change: the crane wing crumples to ordinary paper and drifts away. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 60 words; the lens is Causal and the cost is visible in the drained origami and the footprints she will soon lose. Closure is a quiet but irreversible re-pricing: the future is now “a trillion smaller possibilities” rather than a weapon—cost paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: meteor shower ➝ rooftop meeting ➝ seal exchange ➝ joint covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise—partnerhood crystallized with the seal literally warming Marcus’s palm, a felt cost for both isolation and secrecy. The 120-word anchor is met: rooftop, meteor shower, two characters, 1887 cornerstone memory cue. One hairline slip: “agreed upon lies” is explicitly thematized mid-paragraph, slightly blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rejoined shell sings, reweighting every prior echo of “archive” and “quarantine” into a lived future. Causal linkage holds: because the buried half was hidden in calcium lattices, therefore the flood of memory arrives with undeniable cost. The final image (rainbow patterns on the scar) makes the conceptual price—she will feel grief anew every dawn—undeniable. Lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lattice is flawless: because her brother forgave, therefore she refuses to forge; because the key warms, therefore the altar reveals the counter-inscription; because all forgeries become ash, therefore her authentic confession becomes the only surviving document. Each link tightens the next under a single scene, one transition (stairs-to-dawn), and a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “treason” into truth. Closure beat lands with visible cost: her blood on the thorn and the key abandoned—persistent constraints that will shape pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Senna’s dissolution reweights the rule-set—echo singers become the canyon’s living instrument. The cost is legible in the final image: “only the faintest whisper of melancholy in the morning wind.” Causal lattice holds: shell → names → recognition → choice → transformation. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“red rock amphitheater”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (echo transformations) and paid off in the cadence shift at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constellation-candle map re-orients her life toward twelve new wrecks, cost felt in the weight of “borrowed starlight.” Causality is soft—ghosts hand her the quest rather than a misstep forcing it—but the accumulative pattern (globe→shrine→map) holds; the Orient test is met by line 4. Main weakness: escalation is delivered by exposition from the chemist-ghost instead of a choice that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: pattern-seeking is the plot. Each paragraph adds density—firefly paths, whisk fracture, stone memory—until the final image reweights the whole. Closure is a Charged Poise: she leaves “only the faintest impression,” a conceptual cost that makes her labor both ephemeral and eternal. The orientation is anchored by word 60, so no penalty; the only drag is the middle paragraph of abstract thesis (“philosophy made tangible”) that pauses accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each letter reconstructed tightens knowledge and forecloses the expose-everything option. Closure is a deliberate renunciation (Earned Stasis) with explicit cost—“he would tell the story differently.” Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality seam: the instant intuitive “stillness” is declared, not demonstrated, softening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the Prophet’s first words re-weight every prior transmission, crystallizing her sacrifice with undeniable conceptual cost (“the old world ends…listen for the new song”). The accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of signal density → pattern break at dawn. Orientation is taught early by cobalt resonance and celestial perch, waived at close when dawn clouds literalize the “new song.” No meaningful escalation flaw; the single deepening suffices for 700-word cap.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft is now visited, the archive public, Marcus’s solitude repurposed. The lens is causal-find-return-transform—and holds; the cost is felt in the final image of him still waking alone, now “purposeful.” Minor slack: the transition from beach-walk to Elena encounter is elided, but the jar-label callback at the end re-anchors time and place.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira becomes the living wave, a conceptual repricing that reweights every lighthouse horn. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of harmonic imagery tightens until flesh turns frequency. Cost is legible in the melted key and the empty coat; persistent constraint is the new sonic ecology she now inhabits. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: freeze-after-rain → polarity window → rod circuit → viaduct retune. Orientation is nailed in the first 80 words (basalt columns, frozen lake, moon, Kira’s palm). Closure is a crisp CR: “the magnetic viaduct hummed its new tune” reweights the rule-set; the conceptual cost is legible in the spreading free thought. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean conceptual repricing: Margot’s resignation plus the lantern’s flicker reconfigure “investigator” into clandestine conductor, with social cost legible in the rain-baptism image. Causal chain holds: lantern memory → Jerome’s death → Margot’s renunciation; no teleporting props or retro-fit. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; the 120-word window is met. Drive lens is accumulative-textural: each memory layer thickens stakes until the final cadence shift reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Thomas learned repair → therefore journal exists → therefore Eliza can act → therefore clockwork heart beats again; the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with on-page conceptual cost—“neither forgiveness nor forgetting, but something more deliberate.” Light breaking through storm clouds is seeded early and reprised at closure, reweighting the moral rule-set. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure beat untouched by any flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the acid sea reacts to create “equations across the toxic sky,” reweighting the rule-set for all cart gliders. Causal chain holds: kaleidoscope decoding → wing etching → acid test → shared awakening. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3; no debt. Cost is felt by the collective, not just Pioneer, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“they go home”—with undeniable cost: Lila’s bodily erasure. Causal chain holds: recipe coordinates → ghost profiles → upload protocol, each step because/therefore. One micro-turn: lie to supervisor seeds her exile. Orientation anchor (“maintenance elevator… three keycards”) arrives by line 3; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored glimpses build density until the apple crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift; no penalty. Closure reweights the premise—“bridges” refigure her shadows—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is loose (how does tasting an apple reconstitute prior violence?) yet coherent under lyric-accumulative rules taught early; no breaks, only light abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the marina’s song becomes Marlene’s new survival grammar, reweighting the failed euthanasia. The Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent—ice-crack sounds accrue meaning until the final crystallizing cadence. Causality is interior but legible: because she survives unchanged, she learns to accompany endings instead of seeking her own. The cost is felt in the parasol-tip cut and the closing duet, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: burned fragment → decades of solitary tending → daughter arrives with bottle and letters → Marcus offers seat, reopening the bridge. Orientation is immediate—amber pavilion, October maples, last bus—and the single time-jump back to 1973 is cued by the fragment in his hand. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bench invitation crystallizes options—past love remains scorched yet new hybrid growth is possible—charged by the wine made from crossed vines that “shouldn’t exist.” Persistent constraint: the fragment stays half-illegible, a literal and conceptual lacuna that shapes his refusal to chase Elena yet readiness to teach.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clearings become living libraries, the walkers lifelong vessels, announced in the final paragraph with undeniable social cost—no going back to mere patrolling. Causality is soft—prophet arrives, she intuits, then group ritual—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence thickens, images echo, stakes reweight. Orientation is secure by line 4. The lens ambiguity cap does not apply because the lyric pattern is taught early and closure salutes it.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pattern is Accumulative/Textural: photo-spiral density mounts, then cadence shifts when townspeople re-enact the arcs. Closure lands as Charged Poise—human spiral amid lavender, camera click crystallizing generations of grief into shared artifact. Cost is conceptual (loss of ruin + public exposure) but felt through collective breath, not individual price; still, lens holds and image reweights prior material. Orientation is clean; causality is associative, not tight “because” chains, acceptable underAccumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elena’s refusal to speak linearly crystallizes a new linguistic stance, re-weighting the Committee’s authority with undeniable conceptual cost. The crystal’s refraction acts as the persistent constraint that shapes her tactics. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each mirrored echo deepens her resolve rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is swift; the library, dawn, and three-year gap land inside 50 words. One minor causality fuzz: the “summons” arrives without prior trigger on-page, but this is absorbed by the situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grandmother’s counting voice reweights time itself, proving the tapes’ decay is the price of preservation. Causality is tight: every chalk line Ezra writes propels the next forgetting, and the driftwood maze literalizes the rule. Orientation is swift (fog sculptures by line 3), transitions are clean, and the final image crystallizes the stake—memory as tidal erosion—without exposition. Cost is unmistakable: “the chalk grew smaller in his pocket, wearing away like years.”

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory thread (spinning hand, singing cables, leaf-fall note) layers density until the backward spin rewinds tension, landing a Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the station now literally tethered by photographed time-threads. The cost is felt in the final image, but the early causality (“clock started when first tremor hit”) is asserted, not shown, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each patient soundbite layers into the hospice album, tightening the dominant stake—how to aestheticize dying—until the fused vinyl delivers a Charged Poise. Closure lands with a tangible conceptual cost: the circle is cracked but whole, institutionalizing her absence. Orientation anchors by line 5; the rooftop garden and blood-work envelope ground who-where-when without lapse. One causality seam: the “four weeks, maybe six” never limits her stamina on the page, so time pressure is declared not enacted, a soft ellipsis that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the last whisper and resumed forward motion re-weight the entire premise, sealing reality’s nightmares with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds—key → reversed automaton → inverted sealing rune → closed loops—each step narrows Lyra’s options under a causal lens. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within first 90 words; no ambiguity or debt. The “loops must close” constraint recurs and shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gift of the tooth re-weights the siblings’ bond with undeniable cost (“for luck…or for remembering”). Drive lens is causal—each beat because/therefore narrows options toward forgiveness. The orientation anchor arrives ~word 60 (garden, hedge maze, Mother’s death), safely inside waiver window. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (the tooth) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: dark lighthouse → dawn grotto visits → glass polishing → accidental luminescence → mist-prism beacon → communal replication. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fleet’s safe passage is paid for by Marina’s public relinquishment of secrecy and the grotto’s conversion into a public school. The “pearl of stillness” reweights the premise—guidance without combustion—while the price (permanent exposure of her hideaway) is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each moss colony thickens the metaphorical palimpsest until the final gifting beat reweights silence into shared stewardship. Orientation anchors by line 5; no debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kira’s extended cutting accepted—felt cost is the breach of hermitic seal. One scaffold paraphrase (“here, in the honeyed hush…”) lightly dulls cadence but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shell’s surrender reconfigures her stance from collector to witness, cost felt in the emptied palms. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reverse-flow images tightens until release becomes inevitable—but the old woman’s footprints filling uphill remain a stray coincidence that neither complicates nor deepens options.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each remembered song layers density until the tendril’s visible re-greening reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—arbor, dawn, Elara under it by line 3. Closure is a clean CR: the perfume of remembrance reweights the premise, social cost legible in the communal song. The missing beat is an intermediate setback or micro-reversal that would tighten stakes; escalation is a single crescendo rather than a narrowing path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a classic Conceptual Repricing: the brass plate reweights the entire premise, making the world’s hidden pulse undeniable and portable. Causality is tight—every shard of debris and vial of starlight is motivated by the crater’s inverted rules and the alchemist’s prior craft. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern build until the collapse into the single map delivers the decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final line: she walks home carrying roads to nowhere, a permanent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crystallized Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses repair in favor of perfect documentation, a refusal that reweights the premise—wonder is preserved by mapping its escape, not its capture. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored observations thickens until the final image (“blueprint of malfunction”) reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality break; orientation anchors within 120 words; persistent constraint (the timer’s self-healing via echoes) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the crystallized fractal re-weights her world, making the cost of staying legible (“some prisons we weave ourselves”). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern intensify until meaning reconfigures—and the final image satisfies that lens. Orientation is swift: bronze grotto, starlight, snowmelt seams all appear by line 3. One causality hiccup: “objects remembered their purposes” is asserted rather than shown (the burner warms without fuel), a micro-break but not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: rain, kettle whistle, and wood shavings layer toward a Charged Poise closure. The final image—“this roughed-out clock face that would never tell time, only hold it”—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost legible in a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the timeline “snaps,” ghost dissolves, waters restart—an unmistakable reconfiguration with felt cost (she surrenders linear life). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each camera click layers echo-voices until pattern breaks; lens holds. Orientation anchor (floating carnival, 3-mile altitude) appears by line 6, well before 120-word mark; deliberate disorientation is taught early and pays off, so no penalty. The persistent constraint—carousel stoppage freezes narrative time—shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: sextant fragment → decoded pipe logic → valve sequence → fountain resurrection. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal becomes “a machine for hope,” reweighting the premise. Cost, however, is purely rhetorical—no resource spent, no option closed. Orientation is secure by 120 words; the lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the sunrise flood crystallizes her dual future, cost felt in the phrase “bear both worlds.” Causal lattice holds throughout: accident → sanctuary → letter → decision, each because/therefore step tightening options. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. Reflection is interleaved with present stimuli and immediately alters stance—each memory cues an observable physical reaction (breath cloud, finger twitch).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the barge touches stone while Mara’s future path crystallizes—cost is the loss of her escapist vocation, legible in the final image of the sundial relinquished. Causal lens holds throughout: each “because” (finding the confession) tightens the “therefore” (go home). Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Amsterdam’s twilight canal”), well under the 120-word ceiling. No lens ambiguity; the final silence of radio absence reweights time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of coiled rope + fog + tomorrow’s lesson reweights stakes without neat resolution; cost is felt in Mara’s stiff knees and the fisherman’s death. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of knot-decoding builds density until meaning crystallizes; no causal reversals required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) reached by line 4; fog later pays off as closure hush. Persistent constraint—knowledge will die without her—shapes the final act of teaching; no outline-style sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crimson thread around her wrist crystallizes the mapper stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“she was its humble cartographer”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thread-pulls and projections deepens stakes until cadence shift in final paragraph. Orientation anchored by ~90 words (garden, autumn, palace carpet). One soft spot: causality of Marcus’s tower projection is recounted, not shown, slightly cooling the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—patterns of dangling, swaying, ticking, dripping—then crystallises that cadence in the final image of prince and bird sharing a broken song. Orientation is anchored by word 52, well under the 120-word threshold, and no set-up is forgotten. The hatching sequence supplies the required Decisive Change with felt cost: Aldric’s “bitter sweetness” is shown in body and image, not declared. A slight lens wobble mid-text (brief causal talk of “genetic memory”) is absorbed back into lyric pattern by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the talisman over her heart crystallizes a new stance with undeniable conceptual cost—she must now live the graft. Causal chain holds: sand→coin→body→stance; no off-stage resolution. Orientation clean by line 10; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of black-sand/legacy imagery tightens until final re-weighting. Cost legible in last line: “ready” carries the forfeiture of vengeance and the burden of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ambiguous drive lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) is taught early via frozen geese & amber basins and held to closure. Closure lands as Charged Poise: empty box reframing tomorrow’s constellations reweights all prior anomalies with undeniable conceptual cost—composted memories now “nourish something new.”

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a lyric CR: the gear’s endless spin reframes the earlier calculation motif into meditative acceptance of unreachability of infinity, with felt cost in the phrase “when the last star finally dimmed.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition with cadence shift rather than causal chain—held cleanly through the final image. One shard spans eons but remains one contiguous window; orientation of who/when is implicit by line 3. The missing piece is a mid-story tightening that forecloses an option; without it, the escalation is emotional density only, not choice-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon-hidden poem reweights collective grief into shared flight, cost legible in Martha’s solitary reading. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern of carving–poem–monarch tightens once, but the grandfather’s instructions arrive ex machina, never foreshadowed as a constraint. Orientation clean by 120 words; only one soft time jump (Sept→Oct→Nov) and it serves the migration lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice is immaculate: one extra turn → forty lost seconds → cascading village damage → obsessive micro-inscriptions → confession at pendulum pause → gears re-mesh. Orientation anchors (who=clock-winder; where=obsidian ridge/tower; when=dawn) land within 60 words and keep telescoping through sensory cues (salt mist, brass gleam). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the clock does not run backward, but the village’s shared heartbeat is audibly retuned; the cost is the lifelong burden of maintaining ethical vigilance, foreshadowed by “precision was ethics made manifest.” No lens ambiguity; every beat is because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of grief-coded objects (roses, clock, tapestry) layering until meaning re-weights. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marta exits into starlit garden, options re-cast, silence of clock = visible cost. Orientation is secure (who/where/when inside 90 words). No causality break, yet escalation is mild: the tapestry reveal is the single intensification; no narrowing of live options occurs—she already gardens, she simply keeps gardening. Cost is felt but not paid in-scene; therefore capped below 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story teaches its pattern—maps as covert intervention—by ~25 % and deepens through density of visual algorithm beats rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: the footprints across the lake crystallize the reconfiguration (“they thought these were their ideas”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 120 words; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint is the Council’s bureaucracy itself, which Mira weaponizes rather than destroys, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new sensory layer (radio glow, dust-ink, pirate lyrics) thickens the texture until the final image reweights the premise—stories will ride sound-waves into lungs. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the same secretly luminous quality… impossible to truly extinguish” crystallizes stakes without curing them. Causality holds because every beat adds material to the same practical plan. Minor slack: the first 120 words only imply location; orientation pays off in the glow-soaked alcove image at closure, so penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marlene’s walk-through erases both portrait and promise, reweighting the gallery’s mirage with undeniable conceptual cost (“illusion of transformation, false promise”). Accumulative lens holds: each ash portrait is a repeating unit whose demolition at the end tightens the stake. Orientation is clean—gallery, borderland gray-zone, night—by line 4. Persistent constraint (ventilation system) shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens dominates: every beat turns on because/therefore links—cog → accusation → journal offer → alliance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 100 words; no penalty. Single-scene arc lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the two historians descend together, foreclosing Marcus’s solitary stance; cost is the surrender of absolute truth monopoly. No plot amnesia; chronometer lore stays consistent. Meets 9+ quick test: closure carries conceptual cost and persistent constraint (now shared guardianship of sediment-hidden truth).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the layering of voices until the rosette’s silence is re-weighted as communal listening. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “tonight had proven something” explicitly revalues the vanishing arts as living practice, not institutional property, with undeniable social cost—the university still dissolves. Persistent constraint—tomorrow the program ends—shapes every tactic inside the library and is paid off in the final dispersal. Causality is intact: because she relinquishes the instrument, therefore the choir can carry the modes away, a because/therefore that holds under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of memory-garden builds density toward the final living artwork. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the neural garden recodes Ministry rule-set with undeniable beauty/cost. However, the missing Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who/where until ~140 words) is taught early and pays off in the synaptic star-map climax, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → drone death → secret apiary → confession. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira publicly claims the theft and the bees, foreclosing anonymity with city-wide witness. Felt cost is explicit: "I’m a thief and a liar… I suppose I’m just a thief." No teleporting props; lacquer box and honeycomb are causally linked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-POV lyric arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each displaced object layers density until the shard becomes the pattern’s keystone. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she gives away the crystallized hush, forfeiting her exclusive witness role; the cost is legible in the surrender image. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One causal seam: the leap from “offerings” to “houses alive” is told not tested, but the lyric contract carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: poison ampoule → memory transfer → revelation of complicity → Marina’s reframing → Thessaly’s witness pivot, each beat tightening options under a single continuous scene. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Marina rises toward sunlight while Thessaly’s mind “sparked with new purpose,” the cost (perpetual immobility + public infamy) legible and irreversible. No orientation debt; underwater geography and chronology remain limpid. The only hairline slip is the slightly abstract “structural weakness” payoff, but it does not fracture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each roll and step thickens the pattern until the closing image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—snake-eyes rupture—whose cost is legible: the staircase must confront its own origin. Orientation is swift (“Marcus held the dice…”) and the 17-billion-step loop is foreshadowed early, satisfying the waiver. Causality is thematic rather than event-driven, acceptable under this lens, but the lack of a concrete tactical trade-off keeps it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the online chorus of strangers reweights the painting from private ritual to communal archive. Causality is lightly accumulative—each stroke is a memory—but the decisive turn (posting online) is under-motivated; we are told she photographs and posts, not shown the moment of choice or risk. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens the final image satisfies, yet the lack of an on-page cost to Mira herself keeps the tightening modest.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Marta’s refusal to stop cataloguing while the grotto actively erases its own archive lands with visible cost—droplets already blur a fresco under her eye. Causal linkage holds: thaw → rosewater scent → imminent weeping → frantic copying → lens-as-legacy. The lens reappears in the final image, reweighting its earlier theatre glamour into a coffin-nail of memory. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; the museum-guide frame is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: yoyo data → lighthouse arrival → lens dismantling → stone inversion → backward beam. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no penalty. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the beam now shines into the past, rewriting the lighthouse’s purpose and Elara’s fate. Cost is visible—“she’d stepped beyond fate’s design by fulfilling it perfectly backward”—and persists as the light keeps calling lost ships home.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: stolen clasp → death imprint → nightly return → paradox utterance → Fear revealed → containment. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—mirrors go dark, carnival allowed to rest, Mara exits with new burden. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Mara pressed her palm…”). No teleporting props; dream-dictionary mechanics seeded early via Cornelius. One causal gap: why backward reading shatters Fear is implied, not shown, but paradox motif teaches the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard freed, Kessa’s body humming with residual harmony, next prison already glowing in star-coordinates—cost visible in her aching muscles and the mallet’s unslaked hunger. Causal lattice holds: each strike → fractal wobble → whales → rupture, all legible under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s telegraph transmission reweights the Valorian myth and Marcus leaves his insignia—an Earned Stasis that forecloses reconciliation with the Ministry. Causal lens holds: the letter’s decoded instructions directly enable the broadcast, and the rose-petal image bookends the wait. Orientation is secure by line 15; no disorientation serves later payoff, so no penalty. The “seventeen underground historians” beat is asserted, not shown, a slight ellipsis that keeps the decisive change conceptual rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensual layer (barnacled walls, chandelier inches above water) tightens the stake of memory-loss until the hidden bottle becomes the decisive preservation act. Closure is a Charged Poise—options narrow to solitary secrecy, cost is the condemned pavilion plus his own exile from official narrative. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Lacks a persistent external constraint that would push to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stamp’s glowing marks crystallize her lifelong vocation against the re-electrified world above. Causal chain holds—blackout enables listening, listening exposes forgery pattern, time runs out—leaving a persistent constraint (she will keep diving) that reweights the premise. Minor drag: the “corporate profit” reveal is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (“down into the stone, up into light”) and holds through the cadence of gem-polishing repetitions. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica lanterns cast dancing-shadow daughters, re-weighting love-as-light with undeniable conceptual cost. One soft spot: the “three months later” transition is told, not shown, slightly thinning the hinge between garden arrival and present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: sister’s death → geode as recorder → observatory scan → data theft → future release. The 40-minute breaker window is the tightening screw; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “tomorrow’s stolen dreams would find new dreamers” reweights the world’s rule-set. Cost is legible—career smashed, arrest imminent—so lens and closure cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tonal pattern reweights belonging—yet the cost is purely cosmic, not personal: Kira sacrifices nothing, risks nothing. Causal chain is soft: the pilgrim simply produces the exact chip needed, and Kira’s drone happens to possess the one imaging mode that reveals the hidden chambers. Orientation is clear by word 80; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern-break.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: watch hand → terrace → driftwood map → recognition of grandfather’s betrayal → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the hand among the carvings visibly forecloses the false-memory trade and reweights the family silence with social cost. One minor warp: the off-stage “someone” who arranged the carvings is never grounded, but the device serves as inciting pressure, not resolution, so causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: brass pull → past strike → tomorrow’s exchange → apology → staged forgiveness. One continuous parapet scene, no orientation debt. Closure is Charged Poise: darkness makes them “equal in blindness,” reweighting every prior grievance. Cost is legible in the final image—Elara alone on stones, pocketed pull, peace still unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Marcus’s public offer to teach is a visible Decisive Change that reframes the compass from shame-token to teaching tool; the compass’s “useless needle catching light” supplies felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 50 words. Causality is linear but safe; no single beat tightens pressure—grief simply erodes until Marcus opts out of isolation. The rescue-memory stakes are declared but never tested in present scene, so escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the obituaries yield coordinates, therefore Marcus descends; because memory is erased, therefore guilt without recall becomes the engine. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing labyrinth reweights his future with undeniable ethical debt. The baseball’s impossible date pays off conceptually, proving past→future fluidity and licensing the non-literal ending. One minor scaffold: “You came” is redundant stage-setting; trim 3 words and closure tightens further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s human edges blur forever, charged by the moth-fortune image that reweights the opening cue. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—scent triggers perceptual expansion, each beast-imprint layers into the final chorus. Persistent constraint is legible: she can never again feel only one skin. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is taught early (everbloom rules, phoenix sky) and pays off in the closing cosmic intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mended saucer cupping a triple-reflection reweights every prior traced hand and redeems lost hours. Causal chain holds—because Elara performs the hidden spread, therefore the glade opens, therefore she can unfasten the binding—without lucky coincidence. Cost is legible in the star-drop that burns her palm and the acknowledgment that guilt itself remains unhealed. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the final cadence shift tightens all earlier motifs into one resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph adds density until the pattern break (dissolved image) reweights meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—shadow integration is declared complete—but the cost feels abstract, not visceral. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (drifting monastery ship) is taught and pays off in the final weightless acceptance. Still, the “never been real” rupture is told more than dramatized, muting the Decisive Change punch.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → extinguished lamps → coded sundial signal → city-wide micro-rebellion. Orientation is swift—fort, twilight, gatekeeper—and the sundial’s half-painted geometry is taught early enough to charge the climax. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bronze gleam at 3 a.m. is both promise and irrevocable ignition; the lens stays causal throughout. Minor over-reliance on reflective exposition rather than beat-level action keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early via the aurora-as-borrowed-dawn and holds: each stone added thickens density rather than triggers causal turns. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Yann’s new pattern crystallizes her future apprentice’s burden while the aurora acknowledges the covenant. Cost is legible in the line “living each moment twice—never certain which experience was real,” a constraint that persists past the final image. One soft spot: the grandmother’s whispered cheat-sheet is a late-injected rule, but it is paid off immediately and does not break pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: tension thickens through iterated timer cycles and photo-baths rather than causal dominoes. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn nears, envelope re-hidden, mask still on, but the reader feels the irreversible shift—she is now the mist sliding through chains. Cost crystallizes in “words, rarefied to their essence, rose like vapor through every seal.” Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: sewing-card angle → invitation → verbal fence → light-traced sundial that reconfigures alliance. Closure is Charged Poise: the completed angle-pattern forecloses open hostility while exposing their conspiracy to the reader; conceptual cost (future danger) is legible in ‘promise’ and ‘secrets’. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no disorientation. Meets 9+ cost test, but slight late abstraction in ‘truth might find its way’ keeps it just sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed anthology and the fifty-three names inside the tin reconfigure the stakes without resolving them—October’s choice to stay illegible is felt as cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged page adds density until the moonlit manuscript becomes a concrete symbol of networked rebellion. Orientation is clean within 120 words—rusted shipping-container library, open roof, moonrise. No causality breaks; the coffee tin’s earlier appearance as hiding place pays off in the final touch.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: because Marion studies spliced reels, she experiments with music→magnetic pause→Sophia steps through. One meaningful escalation: the hand-condensation between frames 1847-48 forces Marion to improvise, narrowing options to “play faster or lose her.” Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the clock lurches 11:48, time resumes but under new rules—compasses point to “where home waits to be built,” not backward. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence two.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Quantum Folklore” rewrites the rules of her job and the world. Causal linkage holds—swallowing seed → dream-walk → contradiction → reclassification—each step narrows options until the new taxonomy is the only escape. Cost is legible: she risks censure from the Council, a price seeded early (“never used before”). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient ridge where ghost orchids bloomed”), well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story builds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: lace, compass, juniper, and tide imagery accrue until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kenji’s handing over the compass crystallizes the option to speak tomorrow; the cerulean color makes the cost felt. Causality is poetic, not tight, but the lens holds. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: decay reframed as instruction via butterfly dust patterns. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each visit layers meaning until the university halts demolition. Cost is legible: Elena sacrifices prestige for presence, and the final image (“dust shows us how”) reweights the entire narrative. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marina redefines art not as luminous glass born of radiation but as adaptive, temporary beauty like frost—safe, fleeting, yet luminous in its own right. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density building through frost patterns, ledger entries, and memory shards that converge at dawn. Cost is legible in her assumed death, destroyed life’s work, and refusal to continue her father’s toxic lineage. Every beat tightens pressure toward this resonant recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (tuning forks, aurora, frost patterns) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: music exists beyond sound. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Mira’s tears freeze as she realizes she hasn’t lost music but learned its “secret language,” with clear emotional cost. Orientation is immediate (“winterglass conservatory… Arctic shore”), and the single-scene structure tightens focus without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered images of sleeplessness, water, and burial until the library’s silence reweights everything. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas forecloses his mortal life to grant rest, with visible cost (“The living would have to bury themselves”). The inciting package, descent, and transformation are causally linked through sensory and thematic accumulation, not plot mechanics. Time distortion in impossible spaces is cued early and pays off in the ending’s charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each anonymous gift densifies the community’s reciprocity until the bell’s toll shifts from survival signal to celebration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the official’s futile demand met by unified silence—making visible the cost of imposed anonymity and the victory of collective identity. The terra-cotta arbor anchors time and place by line 3; no orientation debt. Every escalation stems from Marta’s initial act, with causality preserved through human response, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: love isn’t captured but released, and healing begins through giving. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—sparks intensify, breath patterns deepen perception, images dissolve into light—and cost is legible in Mae’s emptiness/fullness paradox. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (viaduct, twilight, camera obscura), and every beat tightens toward the door of starlight. The ghost’s fading smile seals Earned Stasis for both pilgrims.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images and sensory metaphors until the fragment’s disintegration crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing: time is mutable, not fixed. Anchors are clear by line 3 (“hedge maze designer,” “living bridge garden,” “halo fragment”), and the closure delivers undeniable conceptual cost—the loss of all prior selves to gain creative sovereignty. The hyperbolic geometry isn’t just backdrop; it’s the mechanism enabling tactile access to time’s granular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the redemption center’s “worthless” prizes reweight into humanity’s salvation, with cost legible in Marcus’s burden and scattered seeds. Orientation anchors instantly (chained man, arrow, redemption center). The Causal lens holds: arrow arrival → decoding → chain break → harvest → planting. Persistent constraint (manacles) shapes tactics until the snap, and the final image (“first seed fell… would grow into a forest”) crystallizes irreversible change with ecological and social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: trust-breaking and trust-birthing share the same frequency—a revelation that reweights every prior image (orchard, shipwrecks, forge). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; auroral shifts, cellular division, and auditory absences deepen thematic density without causal rupture. Cost is legible in Elena’s bodily endurance and the forge’s ashen residue. Orientation anchors instantly (“greenhouse glass,” “Arctic night”).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned imagery (light, flowers, jar) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—golden-hour beauty masks truth, moonlight reveals it. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Cassia walks into the night, bearing the cost of seeing truth, as the final image reweights the entire premise. Orientation is immediate (“abandoned metro station,” “Cassia,” “golden hour fading”). Cost is legible in the mother’s weeping-as-relief and Cassia’s burdened solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: repeated acts of glassblowing intensify into thematic resonance, culminating in Charged Poise—seventeen spheres refracting light where catastrophe once lived. Orientation anchors instantly (who, where, when). Closure reconfigures the control room from site of failure to sanctuary of inquiry, with cost felt in Marina’s exile and the bookmark’s silent witness. Every beat tightens the pattern toward this reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal drive lens holds tightly: the child’s cast → coordinates → library → confrontation → reversal via decoded formulas. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Marcus reclaims agency by weaponizing engineered fear, while Jake collapses under transferred phobias. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (Marcus, rusted library, post-collapse roof). The seashell’s resonance shift pays off the early whisper motif with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the endless night is reframed not as destination but process, with cost legible in her relinquished expectation (“the star would not die tonight”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (booklet, star, hush), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Orientation anchors immediately (“pebble-shore oracle... storm-tossed ridge fort”), and the ambered hush pattern pays off by crystallizing stakes. Cost is felt in her smile’s bittersweet patience.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing via layered timelines converging on the violin. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: consciousness arises from the “searching itself,” reweighting the entire premise with conceptual cost—thoughts are not found but forged in repetition. The ice violin’s sublimation and reformation across seventeen tomorrows crystallizes Charged Poise: options (to seek or serve) are legible, stakes (eternal recurrence vs. revelation) are clear, and cost (endless labor as sacred act) is felt. Orientation is flawless by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options reconfigured, mistrust thawing but not erased, with clear emotional cost. The causal chain—doodles → meeting → confession → Marcus’s accountability—is tight, motivated, and free of coincidence. Orientation is immediate (“museum’s night registrar,” “forecourt”), and the drive lens (Causal) holds throughout. Cost is legible in Mira’s admission of misdirection and Samuel’s burdened silence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring marbles, polishing rituals, and vine rebellions until the final image reweights everything: “gardens know their gardeners” becomes a lived truth, not a platitude. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the Ministry’s metric is exposed as blind to the real currency of care—and cost is legible in every cracked marble and copper-wired victory. Orientation is immediate (“withered vine dresser… garden maze”), and the single scene tightens around one dominant stake: truth vs. measurable fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring paradoxes (“icy warmth,” “mechanically warm”) until the twilight hush culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: time as a web, not a river. Orientation is immediate and stable—Kepler-442b orbit, Lab Seven, twilight alignment—and closure lands via Charged Poise: Ira’s smile as she accepts her role as “navigator of time’s hidden dimensions.” Cost is legible in the station’s shudder, frost amid heat, and Vasquez’s alarm, though the physical stakes remain slightly abstract. The fractal revelation and temporal bleed are earned through prior setup of holographic principles and specimen behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus crystallizes his stance by completing Elisabetta’s unfinished note, transforming the pit from purgatory to conduit. Cost is legible—the program dissolves, yet its revelation becomes permanent via co-authorship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of water-damaged notation, spectral reflections, and acoustics until the final harmonic transcends physical limits. Orientation is immediate (“orchestra pit… knee-deep”), and causality remains intact under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (illustrations, margins, aurora) until the climax reweights everything: the flowers exist only in liminal states, and Mira’s truth must live there too. Orientation is immediate (“Station Seven,” “fever,” “mountain weather station”) and disorientation serves closure (fever dreams → real flowers). The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing: knowledge that thrives in contradiction cannot survive institutional capture. Cost is legible in Mira’s swallowed truth and smudged signature—she carries it down, unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sentence to last: static-laced confessions layer like sediment until Marcus locates the valve wheel, triggering a Conceptual Repricing—he reframes exploration as ethical witnessing. Closure lands via Charged Poise: leaving the artifact behind reconfigures the ghost shift from superstition to collective memory, with cost legible in “the weight of that swallowed truth” settling into his bones. Orientation anchors (“Brackenridge tunnel,” “1982,” headlamp beam) are precise by line 30. No causality breaks; every radio fragment tightens thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library is redefined not as archive but ecosystem, the keeper not as scribe but garden. This reframing carries conceptual cost—the loss of fixed history—and is crystallized in the final origami metaphor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with escalating density of transformation imagery (books→soil→moss→memory). Orientation is immediate (“beneath the city’s forgotten foundations”), and the river’s sediment-memories function as a taught pattern that pays off in the ending’s “eternal present moment.”

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the curl’s release crystallizes a shift from private tending to shared transmission of wonder, with palpable cost—Elena surrenders the physical anchor of memory.

Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves the metaphysical stakes and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through spiraling repetitions of memory, prophecy, and musical motifs until the mirrored horizon folds time itself. Orientation is immediate: Mei in a glass spire by a frozen lake at dawn, clutching a nautilus shell. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the crystalline instant where Mei conducts all symphonies at once—with conceptual cost: her chronological homelessness resolved only by surrendering linear time. The tightening (exhaustion approaching) narrows her window to act, making the final crescendo feel urgent and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kira chooses integration over deferral, foreclosing infinite possibilities with visible cost (loss of floating, dissolution of viaduct).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena’s reaffirmed commitment reconfigures her solitude into resistance, with conceptual cost (suppressed truth now weaponized). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of storm data, repeated instruments, and layered quiet build to a cadence shift at the pigeon’s second note. Orientation is immediate (“dusk,” “courtyard,” “Elena”), and causality holds: being followed → lateral movement → realization → reply. The hidden compartment payoff is earned by prior attention to detail.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance shifts from grief to purpose, with visible cost in her irreversible transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of extinct scents intensifies pressure until the final image reweights memory as luminous preservation. Every beat links via sensory escalation (“honey-vanilla… metallic sweetness… rain-touched cedar”), narrowing options until she becomes the archive. Cost is legible in “tears that weren’t solely sorrowful but were portals.”

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.5)

No causality breaks; even the child’s arrival feels magnetized by Mara’s note, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vera exits the grotto with harvested half-truths, having foreclosed personal emotional fulfillment to serve clients’ needs—a stance reconfigured by dusk’s transformation window. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; emotional resonances layer like amber deposits, intensifying until the petal saturates. Cost is legible in the final image: “static electricity still tingled on her fingertips,” a sensory echo of denied completion. Every beat tightens around the central constraint—the grotto’s brief permeability at dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (symphony → locket → library → students), culminating in Conceptual Repricing—compassion as tidal currency. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Margot’s final smile under Orion’s belt crystallizes her reconfigured stance with legible cost (abandoning transactional logic for communal stewardship). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact despite coincidence (mistaken address), which complicates but doesn’t resolve. The locket’s misdirection initiates a chain of earned choices, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pattern recognition of the tag builds density until the spiral path crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the arbor becomes a mirror, not monument—with conceptual cost: the first artist’s decades of exile are redeemed through communal reintegration.

Every shard (dawn work, mapping, descent) serves the accumulating texture that culminates in the cave encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time’s natural flow is restored by honoring extinction, reweighting the entire premise with undeniable cost—the evaporation of borrowed minutes, Morteus awakening early. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with cadence shifts (humming pendant → quiet infinity symbol) intensifying pressure. Causality holds: each illustration completed directly releases stolen time. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation serves closure—and the final image crystallizes a before/after legible through environmental and bodily change.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with pressure escalating through layered sensory and symbolic density—bioluminescent fungi, humming trees, glowing mosaic—culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: absence redefined as presence via emotional mathematics. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (“loss was only ambiguous because humans insisted on binary definitions”) and resonant reconfiguration (Morrow’s buried optimism blooming into certainty). The pattern is taught early (eternal twilight, mineral silence) and paid off in the fungal equations and Elias’s voice-from-patterns. Every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Edgar’s understanding shifts from solitary guardian to collaborative preserver, crystallizing new stakes without physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalating through intensifying botanical anomalies until Marcus’s own metamorphosis becomes the resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: he stands “no longer fully human, no longer fully plant,” with the conceptual cost of inherited duty made undeniable. The storm-season trigger, grandmother’s warning, and merging leaf form a coherent causal web. Every beat tightens the thematic stake without soft resets or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where rain trails, amber, and pure water accrue symbolic and practical weight until the final image reconfigures loss as creation. Orientation is immediate: “tidal causeway,” “Mara,” “Threshold Island” anchor by line 2. The closure—a Charged Poise—is crystallized in Mara’s decision to paint with the last pre-war rain, foreclosing mere survival in favor of truth-telling. Cost is legible: the brooch buried, the water spent, sleep deferred—all paid on the page.

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: compasses no longer point north but “where home waits to be built,” reweighting the story’s core logic with emotional and conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of recurring images (clock, film, coral, compasses) builds until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“three miles above the Pacific”), and causality remains intact within the established rules. The broken clock’s movement at 11:48 provides undeniable on-page cost and transformation.

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira redefines reality itself to preserve multiplicity, with clear cost (institutional defiance) and opalescent seed payoff. Orientation is immediate (“ancient ridge,” “Mira,” “monsoon in three days”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of memory shards intensifies until the final ledger entry crystallizes meaning. Every beat tightens toward the monsoon deadline, and the seed’s return confirms earned resolution.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each sensory detail, object, and memory layering toward a Charged Poise closure: Kenji entrusting the compass to the student while resolving to write Yuki. Cost is legible in the cerulean needle—the color of unsaid words—and in the pruned juniper’s “imperfect but honest” shape. The ghost ship’s bell tolling once crystallizes the before/after: messages can return. Orientation is immediate (“islet,” “porch,” “Master Kenji”), and causality flows through pattern, not plot.
