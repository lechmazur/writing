  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (greenhouse, three weeks post-flood, Helena among the wreckage). The closure—documenting seventeen scale types and deciding to begin again—reconfigures the opening stakes: she sought incremental beauty but discovers that transformation persists even in decay, with cost legible in her acceptance of cyclical loss ("More water, more damage, more opportunities"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from mourning lost butterflies to seeing "what she'd missed while the butterflies lived," narrowing her stance from possession to witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (canyon, post-explosion, luminous glass artist). The Drive Lens reads as Causal with a situational accent: Vera follows ledger → finds cache → confronts Galloway. However, the climactic reversal—Galloway's capitulation and binding—occurs in summary ("Galloway bound and following, his ledgers and location traded for clemency"), deflating the closure beat. The cost is asserted but not dramatized: we don't see the negotiation, the physical struggle, or the moment of his choice, only its aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the installation builds through repeated acts of thermal mapping until the final image (tuning fork case pressed to heart) reweights the opening trauma. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara accepts permanent silence and discovers meaning in bodily heat-mapping. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One persistent constraint (the lost voice/hearing) shapes all tactics. The final "deeper frequency" line borders on stating theme rather than letting the image do the work, but the leather-bound book and tuning fork case anchor the closure with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Marcel receives the package, dreams provide knowledge, he descends and performs the ritual restoration that allows the ghosts to release. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Tuesday, funeral parlor, Marcel). The closure—ghosts fading after the lens installation and Marcel's acknowledgment—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the library gains "an address," the scholars release their vigil) with visible cost (Marcel's exhaustion, days of labor in liminal time). One weakness: the dreams function as convenient exposition rather than earned discovery, and the underwater journey's impossible physics (breathable atmosphere "through sheer stubborn refusal") arrives without prior setup, reading as a late rule introduction that solves problems it didn't help create.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Mara, arbor, dawn, sanctions context by paragraph two). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through descriptive density (bell inscriptions, midnight runs, network calls) toward a tonal shift when Mara rings the bell and declares the network, crystallizing the community's knowledge and future stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the young woman's pledge and the final image of "fed futures" reconfigure survival into continuity with felt cost (exile persists, sanctions remain). One ambiguity: the midnight-run habit and the declaration feel like separate modes without a single causal tightening that forces the choice to reveal; the turn reads more thematic than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, twilight viaduct). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and reflection layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding transfiguration of love), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—Mei gains insight without forfeiting a live option on the page. The pilgrim's appearance and departure feel more like staged epiphany than causal pressure, and the final image reweights prior material yet the felt price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, and when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the layering of temporal architecture, hyperbolic geometry, and maze symbolism, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra's recursive existence is reframed as intentional design rather than curse. The photographs disintegrate on the page, providing a visible cost tied to the closure image. However, the mechanics of the transformation—why the halo fragment responds now, what specific action Lyra takes beyond "pressing her palm"—remain abstract, and the before/after shift in Lyra's condition (still retrocognitive but now "understanding" it) lacks concrete consequence beyond interior reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with situational elements (wall demolition provides cover). Orientation anchors arrive early (kneeling, carnival setting, prisoner status). The closure—planting seeds in wasteland—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she chooses to "bind herself to something greater"), but the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; we don't see what she sacrifices by going to the wasteland instead of distributing evidence immediately. The key-decoding sequence provides a meaningful tightening, but the arrow's discovery and her escape proceed without friction, weakening the sense of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece accumulates pressure through concrete imagery (collecting absences, heating the forge, cellular death-songs) and lands a clear on-page closure when Mira drops the crystal into the forge—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that forecloses preservation with visible cost and reweights her relationship to memory. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when she hears the sound and must choose. The inferred lens holds without contradiction through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by opening lines). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through moonbeam imagery and the "seventeen portraits" motif. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the decision to paint, but the cost is asserted ("some thefts are actually homecomings") rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed with dramatized price. The jar's return and Maya's departure occur without friction or sacrifice that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (ice breaking, glass forming, bookmark crack) and a single meaningful deepening when Marcus decides to reach out. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph crystallizes his shift from solitary narration to imagined reunion, reweighting the control room from sanctuary to future gathering space. Cost is felt—he relinquishes protective isolation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. One micro turn (picking up the bookmark) sets up the closure without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (rusted library, Maya, tonight's case). Drive lens reads Causal with motivated steps: case leads Maya to library, cast reveals compounds, Maya photographs and calls authorities. However, the closure—Maya walking away with "the truth clutched in both hands"—relies on an off-page reversal (Reeves's phone call reframes the betrayal) rather than a visible on-page cost or decisive change in Maya's stance; the final image asserts thematic resolution ("vulnerability...the only power that couldn't be taken away") without dramatizing what Maya forfeits or how her options narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the oracle arrives, catalogs three silences, and delivers a map-as-gift. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the commander "beginning to understand" how to navigate by absence), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. The final line "something like navigation began" gestures toward agency without demonstrating a foreclosed path or visible price. Orientation is clean; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The Accumulative lens is taught early through the loop structure and holds consistently to closure; each iteration adds density until the violin performance crystallizes understanding. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces searching) with conceptual cost legible in "purpose had been there all along"—the realization that his question-asking *was* the answer forecloses the search. One tightening point (fourth loop comprehension) is sufficient for this length, and the because/therefore chain from repeated experience to insight reads clean.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (doodles, lens, eavesdropping, crystals) and reweights them at closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (Mira, forecourt, night desk). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira's gesture with the ticket and the hand-reach moment crystallize mutual understanding with felt emotional cost. However, the cost remains largely implied; the final image ("language beyond sound") asserts resolution rather than showing a visible price or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost proof is softer than required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (maze's heart, morning after announcement, Marcus's score). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: the vine dresser's ritual and story accumulate to reweight Marcus's initial stake (his negative-seven score) through the garden's impossible blooming/withering that demonstrates her unmeasurable relationship. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus stands among the polished marbles while "the garden bloomed and withered around him, keeping its own measurements"—the Institute's quantification is reweighed against cultivated truth. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: his score remains unchanged, yet its authority is dismantled. One meaningful deepening occurs when the garden's simultaneous seasons are revealed as response rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Kael's months of tracking lead to the nexus manipulation, which produces the holographic proof, earning Venn's acknowledgment. Orientation anchors (station, gas giant, observation deck) land within the first third. The closure—Kael's vindication and return to work—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the obliging mechanic who rewrote time itself), though the cost is more thematic than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Ephemera's rest cycle aligns with the nexus activation, narrowing the window for proof.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (flooded pit, lanterns, three days). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues accumulate (program stains, lantern responses, water-written confession) until the final cadence shift when Marta plays Constance's piece and the house "felt complete." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marta's promise to "tell them" forecloses silence, and the mutual acknowledgment between musician and ghost reweights the premise with felt cost (seventy-year wait ended). One tightening occurs when the conductor's name emerges, narrowing the mystery. Cost is legible: Marta will "disrupt the official history," staking her credibility tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (mountain station, Mira waking, Chen present). The closure—Mira rewriting the oracle to express uncertainty and the system's first honest advisory—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new interface reweights the premise (fault-tolerance vs. acknowledgment of limits) with conceptual cost legible in "what couldn't be undone" and "humbler wisdom." One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the marginalized data, narrowing options toward the redesign. Cost proof: "auroral sorrow of what couldn't be undone" and "dangerous illusion that fault-tolerance meant infallibility" make the conceptual price unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marcus collects calls, traces names, maps confessions across five nights, building density toward the final valve-turn that "lightens" the shadows. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the factory ghost shift reweighted as "psychic impressions" of collective guilt—with conceptual cost legible in "until every family found the courage to speak directly." The shift-change sound offers a resonant final image. One deduction: the causality of Marcus's valve-turning producing the lightening effect is asserted rather than motivated by prior mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (library dissolving, refuge deepening, swan unfolding) toward a final reconfiguration where the chronicle keeper accepts her own dissolution. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she commits to recording nothing and becoming archive—but the cost remains abstract and told rather than felt on the page. The origami swan's appearance and message feel convenient rather than causally earned; it arrives to unlock a deeper chamber without prior setup that would make its guidance necessary. One meaningful deepening occurs (surface refuge → subterranean heart), but the because/therefore linkage from swan to burrowing to final stance is loose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Mara's deliberate therapeutic choices (location, eclipse timing, guitar) create the conditions for Thomas's breakthrough. Orientation anchors quickly (clinic, Sage Ridge, eclipse day). The closure—Thomas speaking and Mara planning next week's session—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (the fragility of the moment, the careful planning required to sustain progress). However, the cost feels more anticipated than paid on the page; we see Mara's caution but not a tangible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows her future options in this specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative lens: Miren collects fragments and the discovery of the Catherine connection deepens the collection's meaning. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the alignment of tapestry and diary charges the final image—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The "displaced" humanity and Miren's smile suggest Charged Poise, yet the pressure never crystallizes into a stakes-altering choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (causal mechanics wrapped in accumulative texture) but the closure lands as summary reflection rather than a decisive on-page turn. The microdot handoff succeeds off-page ("encrypted confirmation arrived"), undercutting the stakes' materialization. The final paragraph offers thematic resonance ("The answers you seek are already in your hands") but no felt cost or foreclosed path—Maya completes her mission cleanly and returns to routine. Orientation is swift (lighthouse keeper's daughter, lamp room, after pub closes), but causality relies on convenience: the contact dies before handoff, Maya finds the microdot during her evening walk, and the entire network responds flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraph and maintains a coherent situational lens: the priest uses sound to undermine the entity's conceptual grip. The closure—entity dissolving when confronted with its own assumptions—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract and off-page for Marcus; we see him "whole, decorated by silence" without dramatized forfeiture or visible price paid. The causal chain (loop pedal → rhetorical patterns → blue marks → entity dissolution) is legible but relies on tell rather than embodied resistance, weakening the felt cost required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors promptly (glass spire, frozen lake, pre-dawn climb). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and memory-mapping build toward the realization that fortunes should "translate" rather than predict, culminating in Mira's shift from hollow prediction to present transcription. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (purpose found, homesickness resolved), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than decisively on-page—she writes thirty pages and descends "ready," yet no live option is visibly foreclosed or path abandoned with material consequence in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: seventeen retraces build density, the tablet aligns runes into clarity, and the ending reconfigures her from scattered to singular. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she gathers fragments by choosing harder paths, forecloses the scattered self, and gravity's claim is the visible cost. One meaningful deepening (runes reveal the map of her timeline) tightens options. Minor causality slip: "procedurally generated" appears as metaphor but the mechanism remains abstract; the tablet's function could be more concretely tied to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Oskar's experiments with backward recordings build density until Marie's conservatory acceptance reweights his sense of purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (quiet certainty replacing numbness) with felt cost (years of isolation, abandoned performing career). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The one meaningful deepening occurs when Marie reports the effect and Oskar feels "a crack in the numbness," which narrows his emotional options and drives the method's spread. Cost is legible but muted—the "defeat transformed" phrasing in the final section borders on telling rather than showing the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when within opening lines). Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marianne commits to the underground record-keeping network, foreclosing public recognition with felt cost ("the integrity of the record itself"). The causal lens holds—observation patterns drive her acceptance of the invitation. One meaningful tightening when the woman reveals the network and Marianne immediately begins mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: rope reading, mandala arrangement, and Sarah's appearance layer meaning without because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear by the grotto descent. The closure image—Marcus deciding to walk on with new verses, leaving the rope as shrine—offers Conceptual Repricing of "impossible choices" but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no tactic changes, no foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, but the final image reweights abstractly without undeniable pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph: who (Maya), where (sunken greenhouse), and when (after fires, dusk gathering). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the performance sequence, the chronic hush retreats slightly, and the final fruit-drop reconfigures the "world unfinished, still singing" into Charged Poise with conceptual cost (incompleteness as ongoing vulnerability). One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes incompleteness leaves space for listener stories. The cost is felt in the renunciation of completion and the acceptance of fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the amber's transformative properties accumulate meaning across three beats (initial sensing, deeper structural reading, final remake decision) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's small change in the blotter's emotional content reweights her professional identity with visible cost (she delivers a weaker product). The cost is legible: "acknowledgment of the wish to forgive" is explicitly less effective than the false forgiveness, and "already knowing what would come next" implies professional consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through the photo reveal, the shared recognition, and the display project to arrive at a thematic reconfiguration. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final "cycles of compassion" image and Chen's line about wrong addresses reweight the opening mistake into purposeful design. Cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page; the "shift in her chest" is asserted, not dramatized through a choice with price. Orientation is clean; the pattern coheres, but the ending lacks the felt consequence required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Kael's isolation → mystery tags → shared search → sculpture reveal → integration. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (three years of isolation ended, vulnerability exposed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the trail leads to the marsh and the sculpture is revealed, narrowing options and forcing Kael's confession. The cost is visible on the page ("I didn't know how to graft myself onto community"), though the final paragraph's thematic summary softens the closure's dramatic charge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera uncages the echo she sought, setting revelation free with felt cost (temporal scars, spent power in the pendant). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—cadence builds through sensory detail and the echo's metaphysical unveiling, deepening pressure via the giant's breath and borrowed time. Orientation is clear early (rooftop canals, giant napping). One meaningful tightening occurs when she releases stolen minutes and watches the phenomenon unfold, reweighting her quest from capture to liberation. The cost is visible ("interrupted cadences would heal eventually") and conceptual (truth requires liberation), meeting Conceptual Repricing criteria as well.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues images (glass eyes, mosaic, moonlight-revealed primes, double vision) toward a final reconfiguration. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Elara accepts ambiguous loss and continues her work with "buried optimism...breaking surface like a seed through stone." However, cost at closure is asserted rather than shown; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the shift visceral. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("she had not solved...but she had mapped") tells us the reweighting without dramatizing a visible trade-off or micro-choice that alters her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (library, dawn, Miriam). The piece follows an Accumulative lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempted at closure (Miriam achieves visibility through preservation). However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no specific renunciation or trade-off is dramatized. The graduate student's gratitude and Miriam's satisfaction read as external validation without visible price. The "weeks" summary compresses what should be pivotal beats, flattening the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Maya, nursery, post-rain, trellis). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through storm imagery, moss microclimates, and the linden's volunteer growth, culminating in the leaf-release that reweights her stance from control to co-growth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—she renounces her old researcher identity and commits to observation-based practice, with the cost implied in "dissolution of her old identity" and the leaf's release marking acceptance. The cost is somewhat diffuse (told more than shown in a single image), and causality is looser than Causal mode would demand, but the accumulative design holds and the final image recharges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-trail patterns accrue meaning through repeated following until the cave convergence reweights "unearthed convergence" from mystical to memorial. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (painter, island, dawn, post-war). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—"communion rather than curse"—with felt cost (four sleepless nights, the artist's isolation). One friction: the brooch discovery and cave revelation feel more juxtaposed than causally tightened; the middle beats accrue texture without a sharp narrowing of options before the final reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara renounces foresight, opening her eyes "to a world she finally couldn't read," forecloses her oracle identity with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory metaphor (copper/starlight, bright darkness), pattern breaks when the pearl shows "nothing," and the cave's "new song—steadily unpredictable" reweights her stake. Orientation anchors (cave, Mara, pilgrim arrival) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; causality holds under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's reactive cataloging accumulates meaning until the valve transaction reweights her archive from burden to bridge. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—Marina leading Thomas to the archive and recognizing "the harder work"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her solitary waiting transforms into active reconnection with visible emotional cost (seventeen years of absence-mapping now shifts to helping the returned). One tightening deepens the dominant stake: her reactive instinct leads her to Thomas, and the valve exchange narrows her role from passive recorder to active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: mist-cathedral-arrows-fortress build density toward a final reconfiguration where Mara completes a map acknowledging both rational streets and mysterious passages. Orientation anchors (Mara, station platform, 4 a.m.) land within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (map completion that validates both modes), though the cost—what she sacrifices by charting unspoken truths—remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. The conductor's punch "validates passage" but the mechanism and price blur into metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a coherent accumulative lens: whale migration → tile glows → entangled memories → understanding → commitment to continue. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts the inheritance and will continue the work) with felt cost visible in "tears streaming" and the weight of carrying generational duty. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by the first two paragraphs). One meaningful deepening occurs when the memories cascade and reframe her grandmother's purpose. However, the mystical experience resolves smoothly without dramatized resistance, and the cost at closure is more asserted ("overwhelming intimacy") than shown through a specific forfeited option or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by line 2 (who, where, when). Drive lens reads Causal: fragment arrival → spatial mutiny → Naia's ritual → dimensional tear → Cassius's new plan forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Naia vanishes permanently, Cassius loses her, and his final turn ("began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again") forecloses reconciliation and commits him to an obsessive new path. Cost is legible on the page in "empty except for one bored immortal who finally understood what he'd lost." One meaningful tightening occurs when Naia reveals she brought the fragment, narrowing Cassius's options from observer to participant too late.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vincent's breakdown in the prep room crystallizes the antes (con versus rehabilitation) with felt cost—his daughter has documented everything and offered a treatment center. The causal lens holds: Mara's patience and observation enable the breach, her prep-room conversation with Jacobson an hour prior sets the trap. Orientation anchors quickly (funeral home, Mara at table, Vincent upstairs). One meaningful tightening when Vincent discovers she's already told Jacobson, narrowing his options to the treatment offer.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (stationer), where (mountaintop bonsai labyrinth), and when (dawn after the town's silence) clearly by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory details (lamp hums, bloom disproportion, root textures) that deepen the protagonist's understanding of compressed time, culminating in the center oak encounter. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her decision to record falsely "especially here" reweights her entire practice with conceptual cost (truth needs no witness; only beautiful untruths do). The cost is visible in the final image: she closes the notepad, having chosen fabrication over fidelity even at the one honest node. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens; however, the journey through the labyrinth is more exploratory than pressured, with coincidence (finding the perfect oak) shaping the climax rather than protagonist tactics narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Maya, port city, three months post-error) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the discovery of the poison label (~40% mark) acts as the pattern break that reweights Maya's collecting behavior, shifting it from aimless drift to purposeful reconstruction. The harbormaster revelation provides a Conceptual Repricing—the bureaucratic error is reframed as a collision of two real lives, not administrative malfunction—and the final image ("the poison had been for the roses") reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (both Mayas erased, one by death, one by system). The causality of the reveal depends on a somewhat convenient surname match and the harbormaster finding her "one evening," but the closure effect itself lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Mira, observatory, twilight, present tense of grief. The closure operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts the incomplete cello and the unanswerable riddle, forecloses the path of proving her grandmother wrong, and begins "to live inside the question." The cost—abandoning her myth-buster certainty—is felt but abstract; the final image of the standing cello and packed shell delivers thematic charge without a decisive physical act. Under an Accumulative lens (reflection + recurring images reweight the stake), the ending coheres, though the causal linkage between playing the cello and reaching understanding relies on assertion more than demonstrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: Marina's memory of displacement → developers' encroachment → her graffiti campaign → community revival → final encounter. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Marina stands ready to teach resistance, the carnival's survival crystallized in motion, the foundation stone a felt weight of prior loss. Cost is present but oblique—"hopeful desperation," constant adaptation required—rather than a single forfeited path made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: Chen's documentary mission → grain epiphany → chemical-timing setup → final photograph. Closure lands on-page with a decisive act (the photograph) and conceptual cost (witnessing what we destroy), though the cost reads more thematic than viscerally felt. The causal chain holds, but the grain's late-breaking inscription feels convenient—it resolves understanding without creating prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The story operates under a Situational lens: Mara's stance as someone who works "in a different kind of light" is crystallized and tested through the repair task, and the ending image of her returning to work offers Earned Stasis—she endures in her chosen role with visible cost (isolation, the endless queue of broken things). The causal chain is sound: fractured lens → inverted calibration → polymer patch → corrected refraction. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara articulates her philosophy to Voss, reweighting her blindness from deficit to method. Cost is present but muted—the story does not foreclose a live path so much as reaffirm an existing one.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure reads as Charged Poise: Mira steps onto ice "older than cartography" with beacon active, crystallizing her readiness to herald the discovery. The cost is implied through years of preparation and isolation but remains atmospheric rather than dramatized. Orientation anchors quickly (falcon, outpost, frozen lake). The accumulative lens (condensation pattern → satellite data → falcon tracking → departure) coheres, and one meaningful tightening occurs when the falcon's return confirms her hypothesis. Causality holds within the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural design: footsteps accumulate, residents join, the bell seals. The closure—bell crack healing, town revived—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract; no character forfeits a concrete option or pays a visible price. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (who, where, when anchored by ~100 words). However, the escalation reads as additive accumulation without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options; each week "something shifted," but no single beat forces a trade-off or reconfigures stakes. The ending asserts prevention of collapse without showing what specific choice or sacrifice made the difference.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara chooses to lock away the vial with visible cost ("some mysteries should stay mysteries" forecloses study of preserved consciousness). Causal lens holds: distress signal → descent → discovery of Chen and vial → emergency protocol → ascent → decision to contain. The piece teaches spatial anchors early (ocean floor, temple, submersible) and the oxygen timer creates legible pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara forces disconnection from the vial's pull to haul Chen out.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: copperlight recurs, impossible architecture accumulates, and the ending image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (lighthouse prison, Matthias, dawn). However, the closure unit—Matthias stepping into the light and finding his father—lacks visible cost on the page; the "hover" is asserted without embodied consequence or foreclosed option. The Warden's deadline ("until they find the bodies") vanishes without pressure, and the searchers arrive off-stage with no tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal: Marcus inherits the bead → seeks the greenhouse → learns the debt → plants the bead → dawn breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when Eleanora reveals the formula's missing ingredient (love/forgiveness), narrowing Marcus's options to a single ritual act. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (the bead is buried, Eleanora released, night ends), and the lens holds. The reversal at "I trapped us both" reweights prior material, though the resolution feels slightly convenient—Marcus's forgiveness is declared rather than tested by a competing stake.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes detail and builds a pattern across three weeks, then completes a circuit on the new moon—a meaningful tightening that lands on the page. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the illustration plate matched, precedents broken, new traditions formed), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift crystallizes the price of completion. Orientation is clean. The accumulative design coheres, but the final image reweights gently rather than decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Miriam moves through discovery beats (sundial, catacomb, tomb clearing, placement) without tight because/therefore linkage. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she decides to stay and continue restoration work), but the cost remains abstract—no visible path foreclosed or relational price paid on the page. The orientation is clean. The accumulative pressure never tightens into a decisive turn; the final paragraph states thematic resolution without a charged image or micro-turn that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Iris Chen, golden arcade, 2247, mailbox 47B, dawn) land cleanly within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Charged Poise: Iris releases the letter carrying her true name, foreclosing retreat and crystallizing the stakes of self-reclamation with felt cost ("Everything could still be taken back, unmade, kept secret"). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dawn light, chalk codes, and the letter's weight build density toward the release—and holds coherently. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recalls her daughter's childhood love of surface mail, reweighting the present act. The Cost Proof Test is satisfied: "walked back into the waking city, wondering who she would be when the reply finally came" makes the cost of irreversibility legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with strong accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly (cobalt observatory, Mirelle, autumn, pre-coup timeframe by paragraph three). The closure—Mirelle completing her embroidered intelligence report and delivering it to Tomas—constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (she abandons safety, trusts one ally, whispers a prayer of uncertainty). The escalation from observation to decipherment to physical delivery is motivated. Deduction: the conspiracy's mechanics (eternal flame as carrier signal, three factions, Archive Vault target) arrive via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal texture in the middle third (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and maintains a clear situational lens: the client seeks release from unspoken regret. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman moves from trapped to released through a symbolic act), but the cost is more declared ("broken places where words should have lived") than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The shard's mechanics and the condensation messages feel more atmospheric than causally decisive, softening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands via Charged Poise: Maricel's commitment to translate silence into speech is crystallized in the final image, holding the coral fragment while under anesthesia, with the cost visible (physical danger, professional risk in a conflict zone where "truth was dangerous"). Accumulative lens holds throughout: the coral's meaning deepens from decorative fragment → child's recognition → teacher's hidden truth → structural metaphor for patient truth-building. Orientation anchors quickly (hospital, Mindanao, translator, post-injury). Single transition from present awareness to deepening reflection fits scope and teaches the pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and accumulates pressure through reflection on the fragment, daydream immersion, and the studio mural creation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight crystallization) with felt cost: Mara abandons her prior method and commits to painting fog itself as joy. The final image—ancient dancer seeming to leap again—reweights the fragment's meaning and charges the ending. One meaningful deepening (fragment observation → method shift → new mural plan) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered discoveries (coin → hollow wall → older mural → gold-leaf phrase) with a cadence shift at closure when Lena commits to cleaning rather than sealing. Closure reads as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: her choice to continue work "bewitched by questions she'd never finish answering" forecloses the safe path (reporting, sealing) with felt professional and epistemological cost. Orientation anchors quickly (scaffolding, Cathedral Quarter, sound garden). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the nested murals and chooses restoration over preservation protocol. Cost is visible in her smile and acceptance of perpetual incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who/where/when) within the opening paragraphs and signals the dominant stake: maintaining untaxable thought against Neural Revenue Service detection. The causal lens holds through the escalation (sanctuary compromised → convergence → ritual begin), but the closure lacks a decisive change or visible cost on the page. The "begin" is a rallying moment, not a reconfiguration that forecloses an option or reweights prior material. The ending reads as a threshold rather than a transformation with felt consequence, limiting Q2 to mid-6s despite coherent structure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered metaphors (shell/coral/photosynthesis/galaxy), but the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Orientation anchors are clear early (poet, shell, centuries). The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via repetition of routine ("began again"), yet no visible cost accompanies this return; the final image reiterates rather than reweights prior material. The piece teaches its pattern by midpoint but does not charge the closure with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cracked chime's discovery seeds the final preservation choice, and the ending reweights Miren's role from passive caretaker to active documenter of "how breaking created new beauty." Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). Closure operates as Charged Poise—Miren's act of naming and documenting "Thessaly" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (choosing transformation over repair, claiming personal meaning in an institutional archive). The cost is legible in the final whispered name and the candle metaphor, though the decisive moment lacks sharp on-page consequences that alter her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accent (the Varesh ink's truth-authentication mechanism provides causal pressure; the writing act accumulates meaning). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: "diverging paths can remain connected" crystallizes a new relational stance with felt cost (permanent separation plus fragile trust). The because/therefore chain is clean—silence broke trust, Varesh script prevents lies, reading aloud validates the apology—and the handclasp beside the ink well charges the final image with visible reconciliation cost. Orientation anchors (archive, Mira, tonight, Marcus arriving) land early. One meaningful tightening: the apology shifts from written to spoken validation, narrowing evasion options.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's decision to leave the report unsealed and harmonize both groups—lands on the page with conceptual cost (forcing collaboration, accepting political uncertainty). However, the causal linkage from adhesive analysis to the redesign feels more asserted than dramatized; the adhesive discovery tells us multiple groups tampered with the letter, but we never see how that knowledge directly constrains or enables her engineering solution. The lens reads as Causal-Hybrid, but the middle escalation (measuring, sketching) proceeds more through summary than pressure-driven reversals. Cost is legible but muted—"dappled resolve" and "hope and doubt" soften the stakes rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (Clara, attic, present cataloging task). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered reflection on reinvention, the meteorite as anchor, dust-mote observation, and Marcus's offstage presence, culminating in Clara's decision to place the meteorite and continue cataloging—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where staying forecloses the flight option with felt cost. The ending image reweights prior material: her new paper trail is honest, the meteorite anchors her, and she lets Marcus's humming reach her. One meaningful deepening present; cost is legible in her choosing documentation over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recursive imagery build toward a conceptual repricing where Mara reframes her father's absence as "distributed through" the maze rather than lost. Orientation anchors (gray space, terrace, post-butterfly-effect world) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—"the necessary distance, she understood now, was love"—that reweights prior material, though the cost remains more felt than visible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara traces the grain disruption to her father's first maze, reframing his obsession as measurement rather than abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: causal discovery (city anticipates starlight via gravitational waves) escalates into an accumulative/textural closure where Senna and Mara prepare to join the communion. Closure reads as Charged Poise—options crystallize, the decision to descend is made, pressure is undeniable—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely paid. The "until sunrise" deadline and the discovery of bioluminescent residents provide clear escalation. Orientation is anchored early (observation dome, drowned city, mile beneath Pacific) and the narrative arc is coherent, though the final beat stops just before full immersion, leaving the transformation promised rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density in the cave leads to a Conceptual Repricing at the crater glass pool. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Marina's realization that "reality itself was constantly pruning away the paths not taken"—reprices the premise with conceptual cost (the mercy of forgetting what never was), but the cost remains abstract rather than felt in a concrete choice or forfeiture on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vials reveal unmade moments, but Marina's response is to transliterate frantically rather than face a decision that narrows her own options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's engineered serendipity is upended by unplanned serendipity finding her, and "Tell me more" crystallizes her openness to the wilderness she'd been trying to control. The cost is legible—she must relinquish her calculated approach. Drive lens reads as Situational-Causal hybrid: her orchestration creates pressure, then Rebecca's checkmate forces stance crystallization. Orientation anchors quickly (boardwalk arcade, Mara, tonight, between acts). One meaningful tightening occurs when Rebecca checkmates and offers the card, narrowing Mara's options from controller to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates gestures and images toward a final tableau (Kaleth frozen in pose, "eyes held galaxies"), which reads as Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where options are reconfigured and the cost of elective exile becomes undeniable. However, the closure relies heavily on assertion ("Her silence spoke volumes," "written herself into the cosmos forever") rather than a concrete image or action that makes the transformation legible without commentary. No causality break, but the resonance depends on tell rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dawn's approach, stone-throwing, and the mist-atrium converge to reweight Martin's understanding of his craft. Orientation anchors (harbor glazier, Pearl Bay, pre-dawn, prism atrium) land cleanly in the opening. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing): Martin's return to his tools with "the seeing was different" reweights prior material and forecloses the path of hollow routine with felt cost (he cannot unsee the patterns). One meaningful deepening occurs via the pond-ring epiphany. However, the cost at closure is more asserted than dramatically legible—"everything had shifted" tells the reader the reconfiguration rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or new constraint that will shape his next repair.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/reflective lens: Marcus walks, reflects on past fires and family rupture, and arrives at a decision to take leave and reconnect with his daughter—a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost (foregoing the fire tower, facing his daughter with the broken box). The closure is legible and on the page. However, the bulk of the story is retrospective summary rather than pressure-driven scene work, and the cost (leaving the department, risking vulnerability) is stated more than dramatized. The ridge walk itself imposes no immediate obstacle or reversal; the tightening is internal and thin.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Mira), where (grotto), and when (tonight) early enough. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of shells and glass build toward a synchronized moment where timelines collapse. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the three timelines weave together and the gauge is released to "track infinite variations"—but the cost remains conceptual (reweighting the grandmother's lesson) rather than a felt personal forfeiture. The causal chain from shell arrangement to timeline collapse relies on magical logic that is asserted rather than dramatically constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when within opening lines). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers evidence through discovery beats (ivy, diaries, film negative) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Maya reframes her work from proving walls dream to dreaming with them—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized; no tactical option is foreclosed on the page, only an internal stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mirage-painting accumulates through brushstrokes, song dispersal, and multiplying reflections until the final question-mirror and children's chorus reweight the city's relationship to possibility. Orientation anchors early (terrace, Vesper, spring morning). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of children singing the code and mirrors learning to dream reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the city's fixed reflection-habit must yield to trained imagination). Cost is legible but oblique—Vesper departs having seeded change, her doubled heartbeat "singing its perpetual duet with possibility" charges the image without on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off in her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the imperfect treaty with "empty pages fluttering" crystallizes the recurring choice with cost ("space between one violence and the next, stretched as long as courage allows"). The lens reads Situational-Causal hybrid: ritual pressure forces stance crystallization, and the naming ceremony causally enables negotiation. One tightening occurs when talks collapse twice and the clipboard's gravity pulls them back. Minor slip: the junior negotiator's final question is a slight convenience frame, though Maren's answer delivers genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Marcus's eighteen-month drought engineering creates the footprint pattern, which triggers the sentimental recognition, which motivates the release, which allows the rain. Orientation anchors quickly (salt flat, helicopter, briefcase). The closure—egg released, rain falls, map washes clean—lands on the page with conceptual and financial cost (seven figures destroyed, monopoly abandoned). One micro turn when he sees the footprint from above yesterday charges the final beat. The "something like grace" line at closure risks soft labeling but the rain and dissolving map provide concrete reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear anchors (who, where, when) within the opening and builds toward a Decisive Change (liberation of trapped voices). However, the escalation is more textural than causal: Celestine discovers the web, works to untangle it, and succeeds without meaningful reversal or complication. The "alarm bells would ring soon" nod to consequence arrives too late and off-page to charge the closure with felt cost. The ending offers transformation but the price—guards arriving to find her laughing—reads as triumph without visible sacrifice, weakening the closure's weight under a causal or situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, dome, post-argument). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through Marcus's recursive exploration of his puppets, layering context and dimensionality until the final paragraph reweights his entire approach. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization)—"Not a demolition, but an exploration"—with conceptual cost legible in his renunciation of weaponized narrative. The cost could be sharper; we feel his recognition but the price paid (losing the applause, the comfortable certainty) is somewhat implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (moth wing, monarchs, bamboo tower, the grotto itself) and converges in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Mira's commitment to temporary witness crystallizes with visible emotional cost ("the knot in her chest eased slightly"). The closure image—touching the moth wing as benediction—reweights prior material and forecloses permanent monumentalizing with felt acceptance. Cost is legible on the page through the easing knot and the explicit trade-off between permanence and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (rope, punched card, bronze, voices) that converges at the closure when the bells ring. Orientation anchors quickly (caster, icebound sanctum, post-forgiveness). The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of bells speaking forgotten names reweights the opening silence with felt emotional cost, and the pattern of transcription through braiding is paid off on the page. One meaningful deepening is present when the rope illuminates and voices emerge, altering the stakes from internal to embodied preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and where she's walking remain vague through the first third, with the bunker only appearing after substantial forest transit (−0.4 for late spatial anchor). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—layering dreamscape imagery and metaphysical reflection—but the closure unit (pressing her own dream into a seal and "understanding" destiny as conversation) lacks visible cost; she gains insight without forfeiting a path or facing a felt consequence. The storm functions as ambient mood rather than a tightening constraint that narrows her options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (astronomer, palace ruins, dusk) and the causal chain holds: tile discovery → decoding → coordinates → excavation → treatise. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (bridge between past and future stargazers) with felt emotional cost, but the escalation relies heavily on coincidence—the alignment "just happens" to occur in three days, and the buried treatise awaits exactly where predicted without complication. The drive lens reads as Causal with situational undertones; the ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a tactical price that the protagonist pays on the page during the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (Sanctuary, Mira/Kale, post-brother's-death confrontation). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: memories layer, the music-box motif recurs, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kale's acceptance, pin materialization) that reweights the premise. However, the decisive shift—Kale touching the box and choosing to be taught—arrives abruptly without a visible trade-off or dramatized on-page cost; the pin's materialization is asserted magic rather than a felt consequence. The brother's backstory and cellular-memory reveal are told rather than tested through Kale's present choices, flattening causality in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and establishes a causal arc: sextant appears → Aria recreates the moment through mirror-paste → brother returns. The synchronized breathing technique provides motivated linkage between repair and retrieval. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (the brother is "translucent at the edges," boundaries are illuminated rather than erased). One micro-turn when the sextant pieces "began drawing together" deepens the escalation. The lens reads Causal with accumulative texture; no contradiction at closure. Cost is visible but light—translucence signals incompleteness, yet the reunion feels nearly complete, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with strong Accumulative undertones; the piece teaches its pattern early (cathedral-as-metaphor, ribbon as talisman) and pays it off at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Marta, cathedral with apple trees, post-breach). The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): mother and daughter's joined hands over the grinding stone reweight the "deciduous vows" concept with visible cost—Marta's admission of failure and the forfeiture of her corporate path. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marta discovers the grandmother's stone in her bag, narrowing options toward the teaching reconciliation. Cost is legible in the line "We'll start our own practice. No contracts, just the work"—a clear economic and reputational price.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of nonlinear inheritance and temporal folding, then deepens it through bathroom-epiphany and the cameo blank discovery. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya understands her role in the inheritance chain and accepts the blank shell's purpose with visible conceptual cost—she must fill it with forbidden knowledge during her tenure "between arrival and ending." Orientation anchors arrive promptly (conservatory dome, astral orchard, asteroid). One meaningful deepening occurs when she connects "first and last page" to her own temporal span. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page—no immediate forfeiture or tactical shift, only acceptance of future obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal negotiation layered over Accumulative texture) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bookstore agrees to exchange rather than consumption, the seventeen rise with agency intact). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (mountain bookstore, Marin, botanical diary). However, the negotiation itself—Marin's key speech—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality; no prior beat demonstrates that the bookstore can be reasoned with or that Marin has tested this approach. The cost is implied (the bookstore "makes space") but the visible price to Marin or the seventeen is vague, undercutting closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mira, carnival ship, bay fog) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through layered images (carousel, emerald card, mirrors, garden metaphor) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Mira steps into the fleet of ships, holding contradictions, a Charged Poise moment where options crystallize and pressure is undeniable. Cost is felt (choosing hurt over truth, accepting永久 drift) but could be more concretely imaged in the final lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the garden as process, reweighting all prior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the rope-braiding accumulates meaning and the final image reweights the university's fractured timelines into coherence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the rope's new configuration crystallizes the university's accessibility—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. The line "she had always been exactly adaptable enough" reads as authorial validation rather than a dramatized price paid or path foreclosed, weakening the closure's undeniability.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush spreads outward, creating "breathable space" rather than silence, and Kael brings the stone to the village—a clear before/after with felt cost (the lantern's energy absorbed, his solitary descent). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through sensory layers (alien frequencies, cave acoustics, ripple marks) and deepens when the echo chamber stone resonates, creating the counter-frequency. Orientation anchors early (caves, three days after arrival, Kael's role). One minor slip: the transition from stone activation to village relief compresses the causal link slightly, but the core closure holds with legible cost and the lens remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of star-mapping and broken-prism symbolism early, but closure arrives as stated intention ("she would prove it") rather than on-page action or image that reweights prior material with cost. The tremor coinciding with the Red Wanderer crossing establishes situational pressure, but Esme's retrocognitive vision of "future-echo" at the end retroactively grants certainty, flattening the stakes. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the prism "had always been meant to break," but this is told rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and holds an Accumulative/Textural lens: shadow measurements deepen into recursion, then absorption. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/absorption choice), but the cost—becoming memory—reads conceptual rather than felt; we don't see what Elden loses (her voice, autonomy, specific relationships) in concrete terms. The shadow-recursion discovery is the key tightening that narrows her stance, and the quill falling is a charged image, meeting the one-meaningful-deepening threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines (Kael, fortress walls, dusk). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael spins the unlit knot while lanterns glow around him, reweighting his relationship to failure and motion with felt cost (tears, laughter, acknowledgment he won't return to who he was). One meaningful deepening occurs when he accepts the knot and his hands move "without permission," tightening from walking observer to active participant. Cost is legible in the final lines: he understands the path forward is different, not restoration. Minor penalty for the mosaic-note setup feeling slightly ornamental—it delivers him but doesn't constrain mid-story choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is immediate (grotto, jade cicada between them, Mira mid-accusation). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered conversation, the cicada's introduction, and Chen's tidal-pool analogy, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "Will you tell me about her? Not the big things. The small ones."). Cost is felt in Chen's acknowledgment ("facing it straight on would have broken me") and Mira's shift from confrontation to mourning-as-connection. The ending reweights the opening accusation into shared continuity. One meaningful deepening is present and legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Mira, trellis, dawn inversion. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and the collection's destruction, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she chooses the sky with the doll pressed to her sternum. The closure image reweights prior material (xenial hospitality turned inward, cloudvines sprouting against expectation) with felt cost (maternal disappointment, bunker rejection). One meaningful deepening occurs when the largest vessel shatters and releases her mother's sighs, which narrows Mira's options and charges her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (gondola operator, prism terrace, last crossing) and the accumulative lens holds: Marco's teaching accumulates through storm-glass observations, motor reduction, and prismatic light until Elena's whispered shift to "possibility" reweights her relation to silence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—her agreement to return next year and Marco's promise crystallize a before/after in her stance toward grief. Cost is felt but oblique: Elena's tears and the acknowledgment of the flatline sound mark emotional price, yet the final image leans toward comfort without a sharp forfeiture or visible trade-off that would deepen the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Kaida descends into the archive, reweighting "ascension" and "throne" with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The sunrise deadline tightens options and the ruby flake knowledge creates a meaningful turn. Orientation is swift (lore keeper, chapel wall, empire ruins established by ~80 words). One small causality hiccup: the palace "recognizing her" after the ruby flake dissolves borders on convenient rather than fully motivated by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when promptly (Mara at the sanctuary, tonight, after cutting contact three months ago). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the girl's arrival and Mara's teaching accumulate pressure through image and charged callback (threshold, scars, ash) rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the girl crosses over, takes Mara's hand, and the threshold seals—but the cost remains implied rather than legible in a single on-page sentence or image, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mushroom farm, breach, and diamond motifs build density toward a final image of transformation. Orientation anchors (Mira, mushroom farm, present action) arrive early. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—pressure reweighted as diamonds—but the cost remains abstract; no specific forfeiture or tactical constraint is legible on the page. The volunteer-install-pocket sequence links causally, but the breach sealing succeeds by fiat ("shouldn't have fit... but") without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal (discovery → understanding → decision to act). Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The closure is a Decisive Change—Cassian will bring the recording to the tribal council—but the cost remains abstract and future-tense ("tomorrow, he would bring this..."). The gramophone mechanism and Henrik's voice create a clean because/therefore chain, and the ending reweights the original testimony with the deeper crime. However, the final beat tells us the consequence rather than showing a choice that forecloses an option on the page; the weight is conceptual but not felt in a present-tense trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the knight chooses to acknowledge the strings and dance anyway, forecloses his withdrawn path with visible cost (armor removal, oath resumption). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies through reality shifts and tree reorganization until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt but not sharp; the "dancing anyway" stance crystallizes options without a decisive price paid on the page, weakening closure bite.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns → hidden file → letters → adoption record → decision to reunite the archive. Orientation anchors (file room, archivist role, 1867–1875 reorganization) land clearly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Miriam cannot reunite Samuel and Isaiah across time, but her archival act—cross-referencing and notifying the historical society—forecloses personal resolution in favor of public witness, with the cost made explicit in "her own heart remained broken." One meaningful deepening (discovery → documentation) suffices for this length, and the closure lands on the page with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift and clear. The structure follows a single continuous scene with coherent causal progression: puddle-map photographed → searchlight forces retreat → vault escape. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mira waits in darkness, already planning persistence—with the conceptual cost (continuing erasure, ongoing risk) felt rather than paid on the page. The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative hybrid: pressure accumulates through the searchlight intrusion, and the final image reconfigures her stance from active documentation to patient endurance. One meaningful tightening (searchlight forces immediate adaptation) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who/where/when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory density and encoded knowledge until the final act of "shaping silence" reweights the prophecy's power. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (hushing rather than destroying the prophecy), with the conceptual cost legible in "choosing to remain unspoken." One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus understands that "to hush a prophecy wasn't to deny it, but to embrace it so completely...that it lost its power to harm," which narrows his tactical approach and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through observation and arrangement toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren becomes the message and the arbor reaches toward reconciliation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~50 words). The closure reweights prior material but lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible. The transformation is told ("She had become the message") rather than shown through a final choice or forfeiture, weakening the felt price required for RR.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately in the opening and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Marcus reframes his work from repair to preservation of fractures, forecloses the path of conventional restoration, and this shift is legible on the page. However, the escalation relies heavily on coincidence (four pieces arriving) and the admiral's pre-built chamber rather than Marcus's agency narrowing options. The closure image—compass spinning freely—carries conceptual cost but the felt price (what Marcus gives up by leaving the door open and changing his practice) remains oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coin's discovery, the kintsugi repair, and the magistrate's candlelit memorial accumulate to reweight "missing" into "present through absence." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the magistrate's shift from vigil to memorial) with felt cost visible in his seventeen-year wait ending. The tightening is meaningful—Mara's alchemical work deepens the stake from search to acceptance—and the lens holds without contradiction through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the harp's distorted notes, the gorge's echoes, and the shade's layered confession until the final release. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the shade releases himself, integrated rather than extracted), but the cost to Kael is conceptual rather than felt on the page—she continues her descent unchanged. The piece needed one visible constraint or price that alters her next move to fully earn the closure under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal-situational hybrid: Sera's encounter with the old man and his cultivated forest creates a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning toward Earned Stasis). The closure—"began to root"—crystallizes her choice to measure growth instead of suffering with the cost of abandoning her former identity legible in the mask-laying and "bracing...against peace." One meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes the clearing's precision and finds the survivor. The cost could be more viscerally felt on the page; the final image leans slightly abstract despite the rooting metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the market's repurposed materials, the vendor's reveal, and Mira's documentation accumulate density toward the final exhibition and its charged reprise of the child observer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exhibition on the platforms reweights overlooked histories, and the closing image of the girl learning to see "between things" crystallizes the thematic transfer with undeniable cost (time compressed, past/present conflated). The causal chain from fragment purchase to hidden-portrait revelation to public display is legible, though much happens in summary between acquisition and exhibition. One persistent constraint—needing the lens to see hidden layers—shapes Mira's tactics and the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with fluorescent death, moves through ghost-guided discovery, and closes with Marcus promising to reunite the mainspring with its carousel—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost is felt in his commitment and the ghost's relief. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The escalation reads as density increase: the ghost's agitation → tile discovery → the photograph's inscription → Marcus's vow. One meaningful deepening occurs when he understands the ghost's need and commits to carry it forward, reweighting the opening "weightless burden" motif. Cost is legible in his acceptance of a new obligation and the ghost's fading as release.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the operator's arrival and press work accumulate pressure through frost patterns, the bottled whisper, and the library's rotation, culminating in Marina's choice to open a book—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image reweights three hundred mornings of stasis with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bottled whisper externalizes her founding choice, narrowing her options and forcing her stance to crystallize. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (abandoning perfect preservation for imperfect aliveness), though the cost could be more viscerally specified.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early through baroque corridors and time-light imagery, held consistently, and paid off when Kasimir's counter-argument becomes a new kind of revolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the corridors "finally making sense") with felt cost—his failed revolution now reimagined as patient archaeological work rather than smashing. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard's brokenness shifts from Dr. Vhen's merchant theory to Kasimir's memorialization thesis, narrowing interpretive options and charging his scholarly stance with personal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who, where, task) land cleanly by the third paragraph. The central problem—music box steals joy via failed transmutation—motivates the repair sequence through clear because/therefore links: fragment discovered → covenant identified → correct transmutation applied → balance restored. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the transformation from crimson to clear, wilted flower blooming). One meaningful tightening when Aldric realizes removal won't work and must complete the transmutation. Modest slip: the duchess's "worry-worn eyes" phrase and the final paragraph's slight tell-drift ("small magics that repair the world") soften the ending's concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (quarry/lagoon), and when (three weeks post-closure) within the first two paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the descent, psychometry layers deepen understanding, and the final dive reconfigures the premise (seeking versus becoming mystery) with conceptual cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara's immersion crystallizes her stance toward irreducible strangeness, and leaving the compass on shore forecloses her former identity. The cost is conceptual—she steps beyond definition—but legible in "become something the surface world had no name for." One minor slip: Henrik's fate is told rather than discovered through dramatized beats, slightly weakening causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discovery (archway → slide → inscriptions → root-ball) with a cadence shift at closure when Maya rejects GPS navigation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Maya, coastal service road, post-storm). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image of carrying forward "the lesson" reweights her artistic method with felt cost (rejecting technological aid, committing to older processes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide's palimpsest changes her understanding from reduction to transparency. Cost is conceptual and legible in the final refusal, though the physical stakes remain low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's new understanding reweights her artistic approach with a visible shift in her conceptual frame ("not flowers defying darkness, but flowers drinking in their element"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—density builds through layered images (amber pavilion, postcards, cathedral windows) that converge in the final paragraph's moon-as-rightful-sun insight. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother's postcard message shifts Mara's tactics, and the cost (rejecting her prior defiance framing) is conceptually legible if not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly and delivers on-page closure: Malik commits to witness and carry testimony while Sarai remains guardian. The cost is visible—one tells, one holds, both serve the dead—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid at closure. However, the central reversal (Sarai alive, trapped, offering the parley) arrives too easily; Malik accepts without negotiation or internal conflict, flattening what should be the story's highest-pressure turn. The diary's encrypted coordinates function as clean setup, but the lagoon's retrocognitive trap is explained rather than experienced, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (alchemist, Lantern Cove, post-wish exhaustion). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miranda's nightly work with the bottle densifies until others arrive and the town revives. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she refuses to open the bottle, and that refusal becomes the foundation for honest rebuilding. Cost is conceptual (rejection of extractive magic) but legible in the final image. One tightening point: the bottle's warmth signals catalysis, and spring's arrival marks the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: two time shards (childhood visit, adult return) that pattern around prophecy fulfillment and role succession. The closure—Marcus accepting the ledger and becoming the next scribe—lands on the page, but the cost is told ("weight") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The foghorn silence bookends provide structural symmetry, yet the causal link between the prophecy and Marcus's two-decade preparation is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the felt inevitability of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Mara releases the vortex inheritance, the seeds regain potential, and the future becomes uncertain again—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the inherited years are spent). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers abstractions (borrowed time, entropy reversal, probability hatchling) and achieves closure through a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. Minor causality question: the egg's "probability" hatchling circles overhead at the end but its causal role in the solution remains ornamental rather than integral.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Mara, sanctuary, Mount Kelspar, storm-testing role) arrive within the first 150 words. The inciting pressure (rope vibration before instruments register) tightens into a manual override decision that narrows options, then escalates to the storm's physical assault. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara's method is validated, the valley survives, and she releases the rope with quiet authority—visible cost in the cracked buttresses and her sustained ringing throughout the storm. One meaningful tightening (override → bell → storm) with felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph two (Kael, Belt station, present). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: meditation → cleaning → meteor logging → lantern ritual → final notation. However, no decisive change occurs on *this* night; Kael performs the same actions she's performed for seven years, and the final image ("watched the universe fall upward into light") restates her existing philosophy rather than reconfiguring it. Cost is conceptual (isolation, foregone relationships) but established in backstory, not paid or deepened on the page. The story offers Resonant Reconfiguration in mood and cadence but lacks a legible before/after that makes tonight distinct from any other night.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spirits dissipate when their words are witnessed) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: Mara commits to curating silenced truths in a wasteland. The causal lens holds—letter discovery → reading aloud → spirit release → Mara's new role—but the spirits' liberation feels convenient (they thin "one by one" without resistance or complication). Orientation anchors early (beehives, copper sun, seven seasons), and the single-scene structure fits scope. The cost is felt but not deeply personal to Mara; she gains a purpose without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the urn fragment arrives, Mira decodes it, posts the listing, the group gathers, and she explains the old temporal order. One meaningful deepening occurs when she articulates "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived," reweighting the premise. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of visitors carrying "a fragment of fixed time in their suddenly timeless hearts" crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures meaning, though the felt cost is more atmospheric than decisively foregrounded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern, density increase, and a final cadence shift reweight the dominant stake (discovering beauty in brokenness). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren realizes "wholeness wasn't the goal"—with conceptual cost (abandoning the pursuit of perfection she'd circled for months). Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The kite-string snap functions as both literal timeframe and symbolic hinge, though the boy's arrival and departure feel slightly convenient rather than causally interlocked.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's systematic work deepens the orchard's connectivity through a pattern of remodeling beats (oak grove, limestone channels, fungi transplantation) that accumulate toward a final image of collaborative existence. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraphs. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren completes her remodeling work and writes her entry, adding her breath to the dialogue with visible cost (her death). The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing, which fits the inferred lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the architect's diary reveals the temple's true purpose, reweighting Maren's task from maintenance to translation-device completion.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a stance crystallization) and holds it. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph (Elara, tower, post-contact spring morning). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Elara's acceptance that "some truths revealed themselves only through repeated journey" forecloses her clinical distance with felt cost ("luminous skeptic turned reluctant pilgrim"). The alien's agreement to walk with her tomorrow charges the final image, converting her artificial experiment into genuine pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (dead reef, blooming jetty, submerged concord) and arrives at a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—seeds begin reclamation work in darkness. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (coachman, jetty, twilight, jars). Cost is conceptual: the coachman leaves potential behind, trusting future seasons. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows his options; he executes a plan without friction. The closure reweights the opening tableau but lacks a decisive turn or visible price paid in the moment—he gathers jars and departs unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the woman's voice reframes distance as fear given measurement, and the settlement's collective movement answers the thematic question. Orientation anchors (bloodhound, Calder, scrapyard, post-war) land early. The cylinder discovery at midpoint deepens stakes and the decoding sequence tightens pressure through Calder's seven plays and frantic sketching. Closure reconfigures the wasteland's isolation into connection via the final image of collective feet translating distance; cost is oblique (the settlement's prior solitude) but the conceptual repricing is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of temporal imagery accumulates toward a final reconfiguration). Orientation anchors who and where early, though "after the shutdown" remains vague. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya positions herself at the deck's center and begins to draw, reframing "true north" as self-acceptance rather than direction—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("she could never truly leave") rather than felt on the page. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and holds coherence, yet no on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off; the final act is continuation, not reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, spire summit, brass-sky timeframe) land by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael climbs, confesses his prior theft of trust, explains his secret-swapping practice, receives the sundial lid, and descends changed. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he accepts the "wrongness" and his role as wonder-giver, foreclosing his collector past. Cost is conceptual—he relinquishes mastery for apprenticeship—but the final image ("descended into the wrongness with open arms") reconfigures his stance legibly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian returns the lid and reframes his mission, though the escalation is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observations and images (chessboard, walking-words, nomadic penumbra) toward a thematic cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) arrive early. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the chessboard and "ordinary courage" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (official narrative unbinding), though the cost remains oblique and the partnership formation lacks felt friction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist joins, but the transition is frictionless, limiting escalation pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with recurring motifs (stone, feather, mercury surface) that reweight meaning at closure. Orientation anchors quickly (seer in bookstore, present moment, lost language stone). The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration as Earned Stasis—lands on the page: she accepts both vision and reality simultaneously, and the bookstore transforms from hiding place to home. Cost is visible in the "exquisite pain" of remembering and the burial metaphor made literal, though the final image leans heavily on metaphor ("colors that had no names") rather than concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative lens: Petrov decodes threads, thunder marks time's resumption, and the final image reweights his exile as "another opening gambit." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (he forgives himself and smiles), but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—no action is foreclosed, no tactical choice altered. The causal link between decoding "FORGIVE" and his internal shift feels asserted rather than earned through a visible tradeoff or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (towers, canyon, three days) and operates under a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural at closure. The elder's visit provides a meaningful turn, and the final whispered line with its transformed echo delivers Charged Poise—the cost is felt in her uncertainty ("unsure if she meant her brother, herself, or the canyon itself"). However, the causal chain from poetry sessions to the elder's concession to her climbing decision compresses quickly, and the "two days left" ending slightly undercuts the urgency established by "three days to decide."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (underwater workshop, acid sea, time pressure). The kintsugi trigger at the 45th pockmark provides a clear reversal that reweights Maya's task from searching to systematic mapping, and the cost—repeated breath-hold dives across generations—is legible on the page. Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: the charm-contact unlocks a map, which then reconfigures her existential stance. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis for generational work), though the final paragraph's summary mode ("she would map every pockmark") slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (painter, harbor studio, mirror breaks). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the cave discovery deepens her relationship to art-making, and the shell-painting sequence accumulates toward a final reconfiguration of what "mattering" means. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the distributed shells and left easel reweight her decades of distance with felt cost (abandoning the quay's safety, fragmenting the work). The wrong-turn mechanism and cave discovery provide a clear tightening. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse: she's released her need for permanence and audience, yet the stakes feel more philosophical than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/conceptual: the piece builds meaning through the night-garden motif and vibrations-of-intent framework, culminating in the ship's safe passage. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). However, the closure lacks felt cost: Mira succeeds without sacrifice, Thomas converts without friction, and the ending summarizes theme ("Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence") rather than letting the image speak. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence shows what Mira gave up or risked. The conceptual repricing is asserted, not earned through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (station, three weeks dead, Mara alone) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout, building density through the midnight calls, salvaged tech assembly, and patina observations. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the realization that the migration moves toward temporal density rather than place, with Mara's counter-stance ("I navigate what remains") creating Charged Poise—options crystallized with felt cost even if not yet paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding shifts from spatial to temporal navigation, reweighting all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the glass eye as framework rather than magic, and truffles as proof that "hidden things could flourish even in damaged soil." Orientation is clean. The weaknesses: key reconciliations (Henrik and daughter) are summarized off-page, and Mira's decision to "let people come" lacks on-page cost or visible trade-off at the moment of choice. The ending image reweights the premise but the cost remains implied rather than felt in a specific sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: clues, gaps, and the borrowed-memories motif layer toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is prompt (keeper, dock, three days post-death) and the closure image—pinning the Edelweiss, accepting the coordinates—reconfigures Magnus from observer to carrier with felt cost (he inherits a stranger's burden). The cost is slightly oblique: the final paragraph asserts continuation rather than showing a tactical fork or sacrifice. One causal soft spot: how Magnus knows the key shaft is hollow and contains coordinates isn't dramatized, weakening the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: grandmother's gift → cavern search → ant-following → wall discovery → chip insertion → vision → removal and exit, with each beat motivated by the prior. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Martin's removal of the chip and decision to change his path crystallizes options with felt cost—he must now act on the permission granted, and the rain washing away old tracks makes the stakes tangible. The cost is visible in his acknowledgment that "lonely wasn't the same as settled" and his acceptance that he must choose, though the specific choice remains open. One modest pressure point: the visions themselves are convenient rather than hard-won, slightly softening the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the grotto encounter accumulates self-reflection through bleeding starlight, fireflies, and mirrored images, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen's stance shift from commanding disbelief to terrified self-awareness). Orientation anchors (queen, ridge, grotto) land by ~150 words. The closure unit—her carrying the starlight wound downward—reconfigures her prior hardness, though the cost (what she forecloses, what tactics change) remains more asserted than dramatized in a specific choice or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines and maintains single-POV coherence in one continuous scene. Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece deepens through layered metaphor (nautilus spiral = growth = memory) and the final sphere-gift reconfigures the Academy conflict from rejection to testimony, carrying felt relational cost. The cost is legible in Mira's warning ("they'll call this heresy") and Solène's acceptance of transformation ("I'll be someone different"). However, the tightening is more thematic restatement than causal pressure—no live option is foreclosed on the page, only an off-stage future consequence is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of temporal recursion early (diagnosis, gravesite, scroll entries) and accumulates pressure through layered memory fragments that converge on the final scroll-keeping act. Orientation anchors (mountain cabin, profession, syndrome) arrive within the first 150 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren continues writing despite her grave discovery, accepting that "memory was just another story" with the cost visible in "outlast her confusion." One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes feral nostalgia as savage rather than sweet, reweighting her relationship to her past. The cost—living with foreknowledge of death and perpetual disorientation—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The story operates under a Hybrid lens—accumulative texture building to a conceptual repricing in the final paragraph where Elena reframes brokenness as flow. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the screw suspended "marking time not by what was lost but by what remained." Cost is legible but oblique—Elena's realization reweights her own repair metaphor, though the practical consequence to Mrs. Kapoor or Elena remains off-page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elena diagnoses the crack and pivots from mechanical to emotional repair.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (floating platform, Mira, manuscript) land by the second paragraph. Causal lens holds: fear triggers crystallization, small magics reverse it, rune-work transforms scars into readable stories. The closure—Mira as "living text"—reweights the premise with felt cost (she now carries her history as meaning, not pain). One tightening (hands crystallize, she applies grandmother's teaching, regains control) narrows options and charges the final image. Cost is legible in the scars remaining visible yet transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Margot's public correction and Vivienne's rest constitute a decisive change with visible cost (career shift, public stance). The causal lens holds—Margot's apology and article deletion enable the ghost's release—and the orchard's impossible blossoms charge the final image. Orientation anchors quickly (archive, Margot, perfume bottle). One meaningful tightening (papers swirl, bottle opens, presence fades) narrows options and the price (Margot's former cruelty, Vivienne's lost life) is felt. The fifteen-year backstory compresses efficiently and reweights the present.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael walks, the library's architecture spirals, and imagery of unification builds toward the Great Hiccup. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the pattern is taught and the final image (the cosmos hiccupping "like laughter") reconfigures the stakes from threat to play. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Kael "no longer entirely herself" is asserted, not dramatized through a forfeited option or painful realization. The Hiccup arrives "silently" and resolves into serene unity without friction, weakening the felt price required for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (hydraulic clocks, measurement precision, peculiar work) and deepens through the countdown sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren's knowledge shifts and the three seconds vanish/appear. Closure carries conceptual cost—she now holds a secret that rewrites her understanding of her role. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when she turns the key and discovers time's flexibility. Cost is legible in the final image: she must "hold the world's edge steady" knowing the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Maya's search for meaning in chaos builds through repeated engagement with symbols, philosophy texts, and the mica lantern until the "WIDEN YOUR VIEW" reveal reweights her stance toward her father. Orientation is prompt (library, rain, subway symbols, father's survival within opening lines). The closure—her decision to visit the hospital—represents a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost (accepting uncertainty, relinquishing the comfort of calculated odds). One meaningful deepening occurs when the negative-space letters appear, shifting her interpretive frame and narrowing her emotional options toward reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (operator, booth, Tunnel 47, six levels down). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sarah invites connection after violating protocol, reweighting "wrong number" from estrangement tool to invitation with visible professional cost on the page ("Her supervisor would terminate her"). The causal lens holds: the callback creates the loop, forcing Sarah's choice, which alters her stance and the booth's function. One meaningful tightening (protocol break → cost acknowledgment → deliberate repetition as invitation) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear early; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through archival work → artifact arrival → physical return of townspeople. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant "regenerated not through magic but through...witnessing." Cost is conceptual—loneliness acknowledged—but the felt price remains abstract; the ending delivers thematic explanation rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Causality holds; the tightening is modest but present.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is prompt (station, Mara, moon rock by paragraph two). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the group choosing to stay), but the decision happens off-page between "someone suggested combining" and "suddenly she understood"—no on-page negotiation, resistance, or visible sacrifice that forecloses the nomadic pattern with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (loneliness motif, fragments gathering), yet the final "permission to stay found" is asserted thematically without a cadence shift or image that reweights prior material with pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived because anchors land early, but the lack of on-page closure cost and the summarized pivot ("they still disappeared… but they always returned") prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding grief as home rather than void). Orientation anchors WHO and WHERE by ~120 words. The closure unit—"grief wasn't an unmapped void to navigate around, but a territory to inhabit"—lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting rather than solving loss). One meaningful deepening occurs when the melody reveals itself as familiar. The piece holds its lens through to closure, though the final realization leans slightly toward told epiphany rather than image-charged reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mara moves from interpreter to co-author, filling the pen and beginning to write signals rather than merely catalog them—a Decisive Change with visible cost (abandoning her original analytical stance). The piece establishes a Causal lens through because/therefore links: anomaly pulses → records change → Mara realizes signals are corrections → she shifts role. Orientation anchors (observatory tower, Kepler Station, gravitational anomaly) arrive early. One meaningful tightening when the timestamps precede cataloging dates, narrowing her interpretive options and forcing the paradigm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's silence-mapping project accumulates density through Theo's program, the harbor audience response, and the final camera click that reweights "nothing captured/everything preserved." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the empty camera transforms from tool of loss to method of presence—with felt cost (acceptance of impermanence, "they'll forget by morning"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the crowd emerges, validating her invisible labor. Causality is mostly clean, though Theo's months-long conversion work is compressed into exposition rather than shown as a constraint that shaped earlier tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates in Accumulative mode: Mara's three-year trail culminates in the cave discovery. Orientation arrives late (who/where/when unclear until paragraph two; the "six months after going off the grid" anchor is buried). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she completes the promise and prepares to face judgment), but the cost is abstract—"ready to face whatever judgment awaited"—rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The entire cave sequence is unopposed reflection; no reversal or tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the shift from resistance to acceptance crystallizes in the intertwined drumming and hand-holding. One meaningful deepening occurs when Theo climbs up beside Marquez and their rhythms merge. Cost is legible but primarily conceptual: "auroral sorrow" and the acknowledgment of lost boundaries. The closure image reweights the premise with felt pressure, though the stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story maintains a clear causal/accumulative hybrid lens: Marcus uses his established skills (map-folding, listening to footsteps, understanding storm patterns) to solve the zodiac coin challenge, culminating in the revelation that sound-based access was the test all along. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marcus proves his philosophy and gains admission—with conceptual cost visible in the shift from solitary worker to initiate. One orientation slip: the woman's sudden emergence and immediate exposition about "most people navigate by sight" reads as convenient validation rather than earned discovery. The "calculated spontaneity" theme is stated rather than fully dramatized at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern (shutters, mirrors, silence) and culminates in a charged image of the completed constellation-map. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. The closure is Charged Poise—Marina crystallizes her stance and the community will see the message—but the cost remains oblique: she walks home with "possibility of light" rather than facing a forfeited path or visible price on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails; no sentence at closure shows what Marina sacrificed or risked beyond anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through Miss Chen's exposition and recurring images (chess, mist, window displays) toward a final queen-move that reweights the opening board. Orientation is swift (cobalt library, evening, Miss Chen and Danny). Closure is Charged Poise: the queen move and the image of the library as lighthouse crystallize the rebellion's reach without a decisive on-page change in Danny's or the town's state. Cost is conceptual (the risk inherent in choosing which paths to question) but not viscerally felt on the page; the ending reconfigures meaning through metaphor rather than a loss or forfeiture that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs when Miss Chen reveals the grotto's growth (four to sixty), but the window-display plan remains prospective, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by ~60 words (dock, Mira, dawn, cargo). The piece establishes a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through the scrimshaw discovery, Kael's revelation, and the whale's call, crystallizing in the joint decision to sail. Closure is Charged Poise—the final image ("Show me how to sail") reconfigures their prior servitude with undeniable pressure. However, cost remains more asserted than shown: Mira's "phantom weight of obligations" is named but not tested on the page, and the whale's summons arrives as external convenience rather than earned causality. The ending feels posed rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (farmhouse, post-mandate timeframe, Marcus and Emma, dried flowers as grief-marker) land cleanly by paragraph three. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through Marcus's narration-as-survival habit, the flowers as taboo witness, and Emma's suppressed affect, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release) when both allow grief its natural weight. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—years of performance and the fragility of relearning emotion—and the final image (whittling in silence, flowers between them) reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening (Marcus's voice breaking, Emma's mask cracking) is sufficient for this length and tightens the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—quartz hum, blue light, frozen lake imagery accumulate toward the final resonance of "poetry began remembering how to breathe." Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the colonnade awakens, other poets approach, boundaries dissolve. However, the cost is asserted ("they can't un-dissolve") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page, weakening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (awakening as bartered transformation) with visible collective effect and a final image that reweights imperfection as beauty, readable under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors promptly (glassblower's courtyard, Maya, post-phoenix). Causality is mostly clean: plant trail → Tomás → painting → awakening, though the phoenix's drowsiness mechanism and the precise function of the bent reed in the paint mixing remain somewhat hand-waved. The cost is legible (Maya trades presence and effort; Tomás surrenders the reed) but felt lightly—Tomás's acceptance is immediate and the stakes of failure are not dramatized, so the closure lands with conceptual weight but muted tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when) within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through layered backstory (surgery, two years of fragment collection, tonight's ambitious iteration) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maren's realization reweights her entire project from study to sharing, with the volunteer's visible response charging the final image. Cost is legible—two years of isolation and the renunciation of pure research—but the cost statement is slightly told rather than dramatized in the closing beat. The lens holds without contradiction, and the single meaningful deepening (realization → sharing) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens early and maintains it through closure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored within opening lines). The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Mara's broadened purpose—leaving cranes for others—reweights her initial isolation with felt cost (opening to vulnerability again). One meaningful deepening occurs when Senna's successful brooch validates Mara's recovery path, tightening the stakes around transmission of healing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph and follows a causal spine: Marcus brings diagrams → Vesper decodes → they collaborate through the night → partnership offer. However, the central revelation (circuits encode cultural patterns) arrives through Vesper's immediate recognition rather than through dramatized discovery beats that narrow options. The closure—Marcus's invitation to collaborate—lands as a beginning rather than a reconfiguration of prior material; the cost is conceptual (years of disguised work vindicated) but not felt in the final image. The lens reads Causal in intent but delivers more as Accumulative summary, creating mild ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat (who, where, twilight timeframe). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through crystal absorptions, each adding weight until the final reconfiguration where she picks up her veil but doesn't wear it, choosing to teach avoidance rather than transcendence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the historian's stance crystallizes with the decision to "help her people avoid" the Kaen's fate, and cost is felt (she has absorbed forbidden knowledge that creates "unbearable hunger" yet chooses restraint). One minor causality slip: the pagoda "responds to her unveiled presence" without prior setup that veils matter to the archive's mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Sera, archive, tonight). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the comparison sequence, pattern breaks when Sera grasps the corruption mechanism, and the final copying decision reweights the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her stance and reconfigures the archive's purpose with conceptual cost (she'll distribute difficult dreams). The cost is felt but primarily conceptual; the social or professional price remains offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (workshop, mountain, Elena, post-scandal). The piece follows a causal lens: Marcus's exposure → Elena's retreat → reflection on methods → decision to reconstruct research honestly. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—she abandons false data, accepts reduced validation, and commits to qualitative methodology, foreclosing the path of academic shortcuts. The cost is legible in "journals that valued different approaches" and "honestly this time," marking a before/after with clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—plant memories, coffee rings, and scar tissue layer toward the final revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's final act ("pressed the hourglass against her reopened wrist, letting her blood christen its frozen surface") crystallizes her shift from closure-seeking to justice, with visible cost (self-wounding, confrontation ahead). Orientation anchors by ~150 words (tower, meteor hush, Mara waking). One meaningful deepening: the roses' memory of Dr. Venn dragging Sarah changes knowledge and tactics. The cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph and tracks a single POV through one continuous scene in the projection booth. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Celeste's psychometric reading deepens understanding, the discovered archive reweights the premise, and the final act of redistribution reconfigures the unused love from static residue into flowing gift. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the map and decision to scatter the letters/strips shift the stakes from recovery to release), though the cost—what Celeste herself forfeits or risks by taking on this burden—remains more implied than dramatized on the page, keeping the score out of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early; the archway setting and aurora frame are legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through overlapping images (astrolabe, aurora, stardust memory) toward a final reweighting. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Celestine's final traced star and whispered "Create" crystallize her stance shift with felt pressure. Cost is oblique but legible in the phrase "moonstruck dreamer no longer"—she forecloses her prior fearful rigidity. One minor causality softness: the astrolabe "had grown cold now, its purpose fulfilled" tells the transition rather than dramatizing what changed her grip or her need for it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (superposition, quantum language, divergent archive) and accumulates density through layered imagery. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chess clock ticking once reweights time, seeds, and hope with conceptual cost (seven dreamless years, the world dreaming through her). Orientation is swift (freight guard, night rails, cargo of seeds by line 2). The cost is felt but oblique—hope carried through quantum dark—which keeps this out of the 8+ band where a more visceral price would land.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchored by ~120 words (waived). Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural inferred—density of mechanical forest detail builds toward conceptual revelation. Closure attempt: the hologram reveals "forest = mind" and he places the nineteenth gear back in his pocket, signaling continuation. This reads as Conceptual Repricing, but cost is not legible on the page—no option foreclosed, no tactic altered, no visible sacrifice. The philosopher smiles and plans to continue; the revelation changes nothing about his trajectory. Without felt cost at closure, the RR/CR fails the requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the ridgeway vigil and Mara's goal are clear. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the guides' indirect teaching, Mara's confession deepens understanding, and the final image of running forward with the ticket punch reweights the opening leash-break. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara stands alone, ready to run, options reconfigured—but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits the length and lens. One substantive deepening (the confession) tightens her stance sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Rielle climbing, cobalt fortress, three months post-battle). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Rielle accepts that "someone always paid" the cost and chooses to play through pain, forecloses the option of retreat, with the cost visible in "each note a small resurrection." The staircase discoloration → music room → piano bench bolt → final anthem playing accumulates pressure and reweights the opening question. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes its Accumulative/Textural lens—library suspended in time, rune fragments inscribed across volumes—and delivers a Conceptual Repricing at closure: truth surfaces across the mortal world as the rune completes its work. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, the core causal chain is mechanical: pellet arrives → Ossian inscribes runes → lies unravel. No reversal or complication tests the plan; the resolution unfolds as pre-ordained ritual. Cost is conceptual (the pretender's fall) but not felt on Ossian's page; he resumes his watch unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story layers data, memory, and perception toward a reweighting of ocean agency. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mara typing her report reconfigures the ocean from passive record to active witness. Orientation anchors early (station, reef, three years). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost current manifests early and Mara decodes the tapping, narrowing her interpretive frame. Cost is conceptual and felt in the phrase "the ocean remembered," though the ending leans explanatory rather than dramatizing a foreclosed tactical path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details (hum, glowing symbols) deepen until the final image reweights the rebellion premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the stone circle and its message reframe the rebellion's failure—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a live option with felt pressure. The lens holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion ("understood what she needed to do") rather than a dramatized choice or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens inferred and held: Naja's decoding → descent → unsealing → transformation drives the sequence with motivated links. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible transformation (spores in blood, expanded awareness), and the before/after is legible—she moves from solitary receptor to active teacher. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (volcanic hot springs, grandmother Naja, tattered kite). The weakness: cost at closure feels understated. The spores dissolve into her skin "immediately" and she emerges already confident about whom to teach next, compressing what should be a high-stakes biological integration into a smooth ascent without on-page friction or doubt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through layered imagery and holds it cleanly to closure. Orientation is prompt (arboretum, Mira, morning routine by paragraph two). The closure—Mira releasing the photograph and returning to seedlings—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she holds grief and hope simultaneously, building "something luminous from what could not be removed." The final image of transplanting seedlings recharges the cultivation motif with undeniable pressure, making the choice to continue meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (fragmented reality, splintered objects, geometric shards) and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "fragmentation was the human condition" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (she must abandon direct portraiture). Orientation anchors (lighthouse library, seventeen flights, artist fleeing rejection) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walls contract in response to card placement, tightening pressure until the pattern completes and "the walls reversed." The cost is legible in her empty hands and the redesigned vision, though the mechanism—why completing the spiral stops the contraction—remains more asserted than causally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid—tracking breadcrumbs narrows options, and the cave confrontation crystallizes stance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph cleanly. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael finds Vera and must choose to halt the drone; the closure is Charged Poise (he arrests her but pauses to witness the ink patterns, reweighting his role from pure enforcer to witness). Cost is felt in the pause and the acknowledgment of her truth, though the external outcome (arrest) remains unchanged. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image reconfigures the hunter/quarry dynamic with visible contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Maren receives the letter, decodes its message, and acts on it by waking Dr. Chen. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs. The closure—her decision recorded in the log, letter incinerated, networks crackling—lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (her life as she knew it ending). One meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from conflict to irreversible action. The "within the blink that follows surprise" framing is poetic but the decision crystallizes over paragraphs of reflection rather than in an instantaneous moment, creating minor tension with the stated timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Situational (coherent pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's blade stays sheathed, he accepts tea, and the final image of clean light breaking through dust reweights the opening's "sky rained dust" with felt cost—both characters forfeit their prior stances. The lie about the magistrate and Mira's refusal to leave create meaningful pressure that converges at the tea invitation. Cost is visible in the blade-sheathing and Kael's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors immediately (garden, night, Mara fishing for frequencies). The closure—echo crystallized in her chest, constellations resuming order—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the captured frequency reweights all prior hunting) with felt cost (it changes her "from the inside out"). One meaningful deepening when the goddess's echo enters the shaped silence and the garden responds. Causality holds under the accumulative lens: the sleepwalking constellations signal the goddess's presence, Mara casts shaped silence, the echo crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid—the piece moves through investigative discovery beats toward a decision. Closure arrives on-page (she will publish everything) with conceptual cost articulated in "silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender," but the felt price remains oblique; we don't see what publishing will cost her personally or institutionally. The proof-by-contradiction frame supplies logical scaffolding and the retraction-as-dare reversal is clean. Orientation is immediate (observatory, Celeste, post-call). One tightening: documents → cross-reference → realization → decision, sufficient for this length, though the middle compress into summary rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera completes the translation she refused years ago, and the amber empties with visible symbolic cost. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sound cabinets, the letter, amber, and firmware build density until the final "tether" image reweights guilt into learned listening. Orientation anchors (laboratory, Vera, amber) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps the wasp's tether function, narrowing her options to engage the firmware. The cost is felt but leans on metaphor ("amber grow warm… now clear and empty") rather than a decisive physical or social consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the mandala's creation, the tile flake's warming, and the crowd's gathering, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where "the place where meaning lived, waiting to be remembered" crystallizes with conceptual cost (memories remain lost, but a framework emerges). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The escalation from solitary drawing to collective witnessing provides one meaningful deepening, and the cost—continued forgetting offset by discovered structure—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The retrocognitive loop is established early and the escalation follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of names and tessera fragments builds toward the final mosaic completion and the loosening of the trap. The closure effect—"Memorial of Unbroken Names" declared, loop loosened, survivors emerging—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the plaza's meaning. Cost is implied (regime will come) but not dramatized on the page at the closure beat, leaving the final consequence fuzzy. The lens holds cleanly through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: synesthetic imagery and temporal recursion build density until the coin shatters and Margaux's essence disperses into the garden. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—her existence transforms from linear performance to eternal echo—with conceptual cost (she "faded, not into nothing, but into everything"). However, the orientation window is hazy: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across multiple paragraphs, and the middle substitutes description for causal tightening. The ending image reweights prior material, but the path there lacks a meaningful pressure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows a causal lens: static shock + defective pill → Mara perceives thought-architecture → she devises light-painting maps → hope crystallizes for rescue protocol. The closure is Charged Poise: "We start tomorrow" crystallizes intent and the final image ("hope crystallized into something solid—fractally precise, yet warm with possibility") reconfigures the premise with felt optimism, though the cost remains conceptual (her lost certainty) rather than a visible on-page forfeiture that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid accumulative/causal lens: Maren maps emotions across cycles, then discovers sentient cave presences. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. However, the climactic communion—"the boundary dissolve between past and present"—is asserted rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The final paragraph summarizes the outcome ("her maps glowed with more than light") rather than showing a decisive on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a path, leaving closure more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the hourglasses slow as the archive transforms from "tomb of random objects" to "living map of human connection"—but the cost remains abstract. The causality linking button arrangement to visitors' changed behavior is asserted ("They added to the archive") without on-page dramatization of who comes, what they bring, or how the shift occurs. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, so no penalty there. The midpoint tightening (discovery of the pattern) narrows options, but the resolution relies on off-page collective action rather than Mara's decisive choice with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a secondary Accumulative overlay (seasonal motifs). Closure lands on-page: Marcus descends with restored purpose, Emma sets truth in motion, promises kept—a Decisive Change with visible cost (isolation abandoned, risk embraced). Orientation anchors late: "Marcus Kaine" and "burned spy" arrive quickly, but "zephyr bluff" and "village below" remain spatially vague until the valley overview. The snow-code discovery and three-day clock create legitimate pressure, and the pillbox's interior engraving reweights prior material, but the final beat summarizes next steps rather than showing a single high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (coachman, fog-bound crossing, tonight) within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered revelation (journals, scraped words, daughter given away, yarn needle) until the coachman's reframing reweights the woman's search. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (she "stopped searching for the singular truth") with felt cost—she must now carry all layers rather than distill to one. The ticking rain gutters provide a subtle time constraint that marks the crossing's completion. One meaningful deepening occurs when the needle's purpose shifts from erasure-tool to space-maker, altering the woman's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (potter, oasis, dusk) established early. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights "kindness" from abstraction to temporal anchor, and the cost is conceptual—the potter accepts a patient, gentle path in a burning world. However, the cost is asserted more than dramatized; we're told she will return to her wheel, but no on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The thrum and lantern-glass motif accumulate density, but the ending relies on thematic resonance rather than a legible, felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a pattern of reflected light and cultivation, with anchors clear by paragraph two (Mira, fire escape, harbor, twilight). The closure—Mira deciding to mount the gauge tooth as memorial and recognizing her method mirrors her father's—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) that reweights the premise. Cost is visible in the rosebush's death and implied in three years of labor, but the final certainty ("She was certain") softens the price rather than charging it. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers someone else's seedlings, but the tightening is gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (reflections, sundial, stone hum, blank book) toward a reweighting at closure. The final recognition—"She was no longer the last of anything. She was the first of something new"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract and未 felt; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift proves the transformation. Orientation anchors promptly (floating library, Mira's reincarnation memory). One meaningful deepening occurs when the book "The Art of Being Multiple" reframes her reflections, but because the cost is conceptual only and not tied to a concrete choice or loss, closure stays in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered images (lotus temple, spiral installation, nest) that converge to reweight Margot's isolation into connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—her letter joins the spiral with visible cost ("about loneliness and purpose, about the fear of being nothing more than a conduit") and the final image recharges the nest motif with the thrush "building again." Orientation anchors quickly (temple, pond, Margot, post-storm). One tightening occurs when the installation's meaning crystallizes her scattered ghostwriting into shared humanity, foreclosing her prior stance of hollow disconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: Mara detects convergence, composes subsonic puzzle, tricksters redirect attention, campus chaos subsides. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tricksters shift to a different game) with conceptual cost legible in the spiral pattern and warmth replacing cruelty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lights flicker and "something vast turn[s] its attention toward her directly." The orientation is clean by ~80 words (Mara, WKRU, overnight DJ, three years), well within the 120-word window, so no penalty applies and the waiver is confirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: descent → disc discovery → organ-guided revelation → ascent with knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when the organ's vibrations unlock the second layer, changing Mara's options. Closure is a Decisive Change (she gains the map and will share it tomorrow), but the cost is oblique—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint paid on the page. The phrase "something better" and warm compass signal conceptual gain without felt loss, weakening closure under causal scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elena gathers testimonies that layer contradictory qualities, building toward the portrait's public unveiling and the subsequent witness responses. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—Morrison's return and his statement "You gave her back to us" reweights the entire investigation through empathy rather than forensic evidence, with the ribbon fragment returned as a charged marker. The cost is oblique but legible: Elena never learns the case outcome due to her condition, underscoring the gap between connection and recognition. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (Elena at the quarry edge, sketchpad, cold case context), and the logic holds under the accumulative lens without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece establishes a causal chain—journals reveal codes, codes point to a "wound-door" beneath the station, Mira decides to investigate—but the escalation is largely expository conversation rather than dramatized obstacles that narrow options. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Mira and Dr. Kao step toward the airlock with stakes crystallized, but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page, weakening the felt consequence. The drive lens is Causal with ambition toward Accumulative (coded stanzas, copper nail motif), but the hybrid execution doesn't fully cohere—reversals are absent and the tightening is mostly a single decision to act.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details (glass flake, scaffold wrap pattern, figures between resolutions) accrue until Mara's playing grants "pixelated amnesty" and the figures resolve. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image shows her carrying "luminous disbelief" as treasure, reweighting her bridge-song vocation with a new layer of meaning. However, cost is asserted rather than demonstrated—she experiences no visible forfeiture, relational friction, or foreclosed option on the page; the "aching bow arm" is the sole physical price, and her immediate return to routine ("drove on to the next bridge") undercuts the stakes of what she witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens with accumulative texture: the father's return is motivated by prior events, and the closure—his agreement to stay and learn the markers—narrows options with felt cost (abandoning the roads). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph. The escalation through dialogue is earned, and the final handshake ("Show me your markers tomorrow") reconfigures the father's trajectory with a visible, if quiet, cost. One deduction: the leap from one conversation to lifelong renunciation compresses causality slightly, though the bills-as-map metaphor helps bridge it.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered symbol-matching and thematic deepening rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by the dome opening. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the collaborative writing crystallizes a new stance on shared burden, with the daylily and variable stars reweighted. Cost is conceptual and relational (Ashwin's isolation now understood, Mara's solitary method abandoned) but the final image doesn't foreclose a live option with on-page friction—it lands as thematic summation rather than a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric-accumulative accent; the apprentice's mirror-walking failure creates the trap, Maren's expanding-circle search and war-song unbend him, leading to his scream-release and shore delivery. Orientation anchors (druid, orchard vortex, cursed lake, post-festival rescue) land within the first paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's final statement about people locking themselves into fear-shapes reweights the rescue mission as philosophical stance, and she moves on "carrying her warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness." The cost is conceptual—visible in her continued solitude and her unchanged guardedness—but the final image charges prior material without a decisive emotional change, fitting RR. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren shifts from comfort-song to war-song after discovering the blood-magic seeds, narrowing her approach and forcing the scream to crack the frozen moment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: metaphoric density increases toward a final image of shared growth. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (merged consciousness replacing separate visions), but cost remains abstract—"crumbled" topiary and "dissolved" order feel symbolic rather than felt. The "future arrived three weeks ahead" premise sets a ticking constraint, yet no tactics shift under that pressure; the characters proceed as if time were elastic, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Moth Oracle, catacomb orchard, present search for Marcus. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—causal in the reversal attempt (burned card, Rebecca's return) and accumulative in the orchard's symbolic recursion—and holds coherently to closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus stands "unsteady but standing," the burned card left as offering, and the Oracle's final line reweights prior bartering into acceptance of "real, whole pain." Cost is felt ("Will it hurt?" "Yes") and the path forward is narrowed, but the decisive change occurs slightly off-page (the walk away, not a on-page renunciation or embodied forfeiture). One meaningful tightening is present when the Oracle reveals Rebecca's parallel suffering, forcing Marcus to see the trade's failure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens is Causal with a lyric accent: Marcus's public failure motivates the quarry job, the bottles trigger memory and doubt, and his decision to trust instinct closes the loop with felt cost (accepting future failure risk). Orientation is swift (quarry trailer, Marcus alone, post-vase-debacle). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he renounces defensive certainty, accepts intuition's fragility, and the grille cloth's final twist signals purpose returning—options are reweighted, cost is palpable. One meaningful tightening (bottles force the crisis of judgment) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (arbor, Emilia, Harrow's death). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the arbor as a garden "in touching distance of both earth and sky" reweights the transition metaphor with undeniable pressure, and Emilia's shift from grief to cataloging represents Earned Stasis with visible forward commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed sprouts and floods Emilia with understanding, changing her knowledge state. Cost is conceptual—she accepts her mentor's transformed presence and commits to solitary work—but legible on the page in her planning to catalog and translate. The lens holds, and the closure lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (moon phases, rotating shelves, migrating-fish mobile build pattern and cadence toward the visitor's recognition). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the visitor's choice to keep the scroll and her laugh at "tomorrow" crystallize her stance shift with felt cost implied in the renunciation of forward-looking habit. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maris offers the scroll, reweighting the library's function from preservation to active wonder. Cost is conceptual—accepting the endless today—rather than a decisive forfeiture, which keeps the ending in mid-to-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus's professional purpose reconfigures from inspection to restoration, with visible cost (abandoning detachment, accepting emotional burden). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—discoveries deepen understanding until the final image reweights his mission. Orientation anchors clearly (bunker inspector, crystal caves, present survey). One meaningful deepening occurs when he reads the confession and understands the owner's realization, narrowing his options to witness and return. Cost is legible in "gathered...carefully" and the commitment to find and return, though the transformation compresses quickly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (disused station, three weeks post-medication, river chronicler) land by the first paragraph. The piece tracks an Accumulative/Textural lens: daily wading progression, graffiti dialogue, and the accordion's visible repairs build pressure through pattern and intensification rather than causal reversals. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis moving toward Charged Poise)—Maya positions herself to return tomorrow with her raw attention, the river teaching acceptance without judgment—but the cost is more conceptual (ongoing vulnerability) than viscerally legible in the final image. The "path she'd been chronicling all along" risks telling the closure rather than showing a decisive reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the library's propagation delays and unspoken-word volumes build density toward a final reweighting. However, closure lacks decisive cost—the library "was no longer lost to her" and "new pathways" open without forfeiting a live option or paying a felt price. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not crystallize a before/after with undeniable pressure. The cipher's mechanics (cyclically reversed) are described but never constrain a choice or create friction that the protagonist must work through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Situational lens: Elena faces a ticking-clock dilemma (violin melts at dawn, promise expires) that forces her to crystallize a stance between institutional truth and guerrilla propagation. Orientation anchors cleanly (velvet observatory, midsummer, provenance researcher, ice violin). The coffee-reading futures offer a meaningful tightening—she sees both paths and their costs—and her final choice (encrypt and scatter truth, submit sanitized report) lands as Charged Poise: the cost is conceptually legible (career damage, complicity) even though consequences aren't paid on the page. One small causality slip: the piece never establishes whether she physically controls the violin's vault release, which would strengthen her agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held: density increases through layered preparation beats, the aurora's intensification parallels the ritual's progression, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the radiant hush crystallizes the "spark, that moment" with felt cost (the coming dawn will erase it, but it exists "undeniable, now"). Orientation anchors (grotto, Lyra, the girl, night ritual) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the emerald chip begins pulsing in sync with the aurora, narrowing focus to the final illuminated threshold. Cost is visible: impermanence is acknowledged on-page ("beauty that would fade with the dawn"), and the families' climb underscores the price paid for this fleeting transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. The woman's identity reveal reweights all prior visits and the hairpin transfer crystallizes the cycle-of-rebirth concept with felt cost (Keiko must hold "all our selves at once"). Orientation is anchored early (grotto, Keiko, three years of visits). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hairpin is removed and the mother's face appears, narrowing Keiko's understanding and charging the final image. Cost is legible: she must practice contentment, not find it—a renunciation of the quest itself.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (mirror shard, wind chimes, refraction imagery) and holds it through closure. The ending image—mirror shard spinning among chimes, casting rainbow fragments—reweights Mara's initial search for clarity with visible cost: she descends wearing doubt "differently," no longer certain but committed to questions. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper reframes the hollow center as transformation rather than emptiness, narrowing Mara's options from seeking old certainty to accepting nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the trance and pond-ripple metaphor accumulate density toward the final image of teaching-before-forgetting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. However, closure lands as thematic echo rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration—the researcher passes knowledge forward, but no on-page choice forecloses a path or reconfigures her stance with felt cost. The descent is transit, not transformation; the ending summarizes the premise ("passed forward what she would soon no longer know") without a crystallized final image that reweights prior material under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The arrowhead's pulse deepens through the ravens' flight into a diagnostic understanding, and the final turn toward the third tower registers as Charged Poise—options crystallize (weeks of realignment work) with the cost felt in "centuries already" and his weathered resolve. Orientation anchors (Kael, canyon, bone towers) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulation of echoes and resonances successfully reweights the premise by the end, though the discovery of the fracture arrives somewhat conveniently without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated mist-walking attempts, the grandmother's journal fragments, and the keystone's gradual charge until the final vision reweights Maren's understanding of achievement. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the mist rises from the keystone, the vision appears, and Maren's stance toward her "underachieving" identity shifts with felt cost (the hours of cold, the slow climb, the rejection of efficiency). The cost is legible in the累积 of effort and the final image of patient vigil. One deduction: the phrase "accommodates impossibilities" recurs without dramatized constraint on Maren's choices until the very end, slightly weakening causal linkage in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara's purposeful collection of records and waiting for conjunction builds density toward the underwater discovery and photographic documentation. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—she reframes her lamplighting work as translation rather than mere illumination, a cognitive shift with conceptual cost (taking on the burden of transcribing her grandfather's lifetime project). The cost is somewhat abstract; while the commitment is stated, we don't see a live option foreclosed or a visible price paid on the page at the closure beat itself, keeping this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The causality flows backward-prophecy → coin toss → static burst → discovery → teaching → transformation, consistent with an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens through revelation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crew becomes "seed pattern for whatever universe would bloom next." Cost is conceptual (survival-by-transformation rather than death) but legible in the final image. The ending reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure, meeting the RR/CR standard.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, the atlas-page motif, and parallel sacrifice stories converging on naming the fear. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira names her grief and accepts the echo's weight, foreclosing the path back to Daniel with felt cost. Orientation anchors (Mira, observatory, dusk, post-recordings discovery) land cleanly by ~10% of text. The meaningful deepening occurs when she reframes sacrifice as love rather than cowardice, reweighting her choice. One substantive issue: the climactic decision (leaving Daniel) occurred off-page "last week," so the present-tense closure crystallizes understanding rather than enacting a new choice—this is valid under RR but lowers causal sharpness slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: observation → understanding → reconstruction → restoration, with each step motivated by prior knowledge. Orientation anchors (Emris, viaduct, dawn, post-fish-vanishing) arrive promptly. The closure—bell ringing, ocean yielding—lands on the page with visible cost (exhausted magic) and a felt reconfiguration (devotion no longer brittle). One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell is struck and reverses the dripping, narrowing options into a single consequential act.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: photographs accumulate, memories layer, and the final image (wind chime ringing at dawn, "meaning waits, patient and preserved") reweights the opening silence with conceptual cost—Marcus must return to burying what he now remembers. Orientation anchors arrive early (Marcus, ridgeway, reservoir, dawn approach). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the town will drown again, but Marcus now carries "proof that beneath every surface, meaning waits." Cost is felt but oblique—he returns to vigilance with new weight—rather than a decisive forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Lyra, orchard, quest for crystal). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the completed Opus Perpetuum reweights her three-year pursuit—but the cost remains abstract (no on-page sacrifice, loss, or renunciation that forecloses options). One meaningful deepening occurs when starlings reveal the final sequence, though this feels given rather than earned through protagonist struggle. The because/therefore chain is clean but the final transformation lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Vera's refusal to revise her report and Command's subsequent validation reweight her observer role from questioned to recognized, with visible cost (twenty minutes of defended stance, isolation above the clouds). The causal lens holds throughout—radio contact triggers doubt, which triggers her memory of the predecessor's failure, which triggers her defense. Orientation is swift (radio call at 2:47 AM, observation platform, three months stationed). One meaningful tightening when Command herself joins the call raises stakes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors quickly (floating dojo, two Kiras, brain in jar, custody question) and holds a coherent Causal lens: Kira's admission of numbness → Clone-Kira's offer to take the child → Kira's counter-proposal of joint custody, each move narrowing options. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the handclasp across the jar crystallizes their complementary-opposites solution with undeniable pressure, and the cost—neither can parent alone, both must endure the other's presence—is legible in "If you fail her" and "Then your fire melts me." One meaningful tightening (Kira's "No" and pivot to balance) is sufficient at this length. Minor orientation debt: the "meditation accident" and "ego death" backstory arrives via summary rather than anchored flashback, but it does not obscure present causality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (dust motes, spider web, echoes) and the recurring lullaby motif until Sarah's arrival triggers the turn. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the couple's shared ritual reweights the house's silence with "the beginnings of sound returning," and the cost is legible in their cracked, off-key voices that replace perfect grief with imperfect communion. The orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the single transition from Martin alone to Martin-and-Sarah tightens options meaningfully. The hourglass metaphor in the penultimate paragraph edges toward on-the-nose thematic statement but remains image-rooted enough to avoid full summary.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Maris chases the thief through the veil, encounters the pendant's fracturing power, and destroys it with clear because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure is a Decisive Change—she wakes human-shaped with the pendant reduced to ash, the threat neutralized—with visible cost: the iron collar remains, her feral night-self persists, and she waits for the cycle to resume. The tightening is legible: the pendant's dimensional doorways opening inside her force the destruction choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (who, where, when). The closure—vivification of the crozier through Cassia's mixture—lands on the page as Decisive Change with visible cost (she lets go of her father's formulas, interrupting her stifling destiny). Escalation unfolds through successive approximation beats: grinding moonstone, mixing with blood, applying paste, witnessing transformation. One meaningful tightening when the cracks begin to heal "not by rejoining" but through new growth, narrowing options and forcing Cassia to accept transformation over repair.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (towers, gorge, moonlight, silence-as-signal) that culminates in the fragment's revelation. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shift from mourning silence to recognizing it as canvas) with conceptual cost legible in the reweighted towers and gorge. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira recalibrates to detect absence. Minor causality slip: the fragment's exact location is convenient rather than earned by prior clues.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with light Accumulative layering (starlight patterns, hourglass glow). Orientation is prompt but thin—anchors arrive early, yet the grotto and "pattern collision" mechanics remain abstract. Closure occurs on-page (ferry solidifies, timelines merge) but cost is vague: "more real than before" and "permanently transient no longer" assert a state change without showing what Mateo or the passengers lost or foreclosed. The because/therefore chain (empty hourglass → phasing → confluence navigation → merge) is present but the final beat lacks felt consequence. One meaningful tightening (turn toward confluence) is sufficient at this length, yet the resolution reads engineered rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Marina, Tessellation Wing, after hours, seeking the Connection Room). The piece follows an accumulative lens: Marina's weaving physically manifests as memory-images erupt and layer, building toward the final pattern-pulse that reconfigures her understanding of connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the completed pattern crystallizes her realization with felt pressure, though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized as a specific forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sinew thread grows impossibly and memories reweight in real time, tightening her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph and maintains a stable accumulative lens: Carta's understanding deepens through instruction and observation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where she traces edge geometry alongside her alien guide. The closure offers Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where two species "expand the space" to navigate together—with conceptual cost legible in her abandonment of the maritime academy and descent into "pressure and cold." One meaningful deepening occurs when the chain link glows and Carta begins to see starlight through impossible depths, reweighting her old navigational certainties. Minor causality smoothness: the aliens' revelation and Carta's acceptance happen off-page, and the transition from instruction to shared action feels summarized rather than earned beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the hearing aid's stored vibrations layer Margaret's warning, the manipulator's voice, and Lily's isolation into a pattern that coheres at closure when the grandmother's message is "delivered." The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira makes calls to shelters and advocates, crystallizing the next steps with felt urgency, and the hearing aid falls silent after its message lands—options are reconfigured and the cost (Lily's isolation, the bruise, the need for external intervention) is visible. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lily enters and the abstract signal becomes a concrete person in danger. The closure coheres under the lens, though the cost is more situational than decisively paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discovery (codex, instruments, beings) toward a final reweighting of Kove's erasure into "understanding" and "continued observation." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (monument through witness), and the cost is conceptual—Mara knows her proof will be questioned, echoing Kove's fate. The tidal clock anchors orientation and creates a phase-transition window, but no on-page reversal narrows Mara's options; she gathers evidence and ascends as intended, so escalation remains textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of fragmentation-to-assembly through corrupted files, spilled ink, and scattered porcelain that coheres at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Mira, observatory, post-death-certificate error). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink patterns unlock Chen's files, revealing his intentional choice and reweighting Mira's guilt. Cost is legible: she accepts brokenness without repair. The Resonant Reconfiguration (reinterpretation replaces repair) lands on the page, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory translation beats (diamond to sound, texture to echo, motion to language) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Sarielle walks away, her language now embedded in the canyon's perpetual song. Orientation anchors quickly (storyteller, canyon, diamond). Cost is present but oblique: worn fingers and dimmed veins suggest depletion, and the walk-away forecloses her physical presence, but the final image celebrates perpetuity more than loss. One meaningful deepening occurs when the birds respond to her touch-generated sound, tightening the translation loop.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. The phone revelation deepens Maya's stance, and the arrowhead functions as a constraint that crystallizes the choice. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Maya's question and arrowhead pocket reweight her investigative mission with undeniable pressure, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally rendered. Orientation is swift (underground garden, Maya's role by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss's laugh resolves the decade-long grief into an actionable stance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: music as signal accumulates pressure across concentric waves (bridge → city → orchard), building to a pattern-break where statues crumble and the orchard blooms. Orientation anchors quickly (sky-bridge, twilight, Mira). The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the locust shell intact, "continuous becoming" crystallized—with conceptual cost legible in the broken violin and the world "remembering how to change." One meaningful deepening occurs when her melody shifts from folk tunes to the older signal, narrowing her tactical options and raising stakes. The causal chain from playing → statues responding → orchard blooming holds under the accumulative lens, though the mechanical-world premise and statue backstory arrive via exposition rather than dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure: Maren navigates a choreographed routine, and the ending image (the bottle placed in the dead-drop) reweights the opening tension through cadence shift and thematic callback. Closure reads as Charged Poise—options and stakes crystallize in the final paragraphs ("connection finds a way"), though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). One meaningful deepening occurs when the drone passes overhead and Maren's null-field gambit succeeds, narrowing suspense and validating her method. However, the ending leans toward summary and thematic assertion ("already fostering what the borders couldn't break") rather than a concrete image that makes cost undeniable on the page, which prevents entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory detail and reflection toward a final image of "quiet, persistent translation of ruin into revelation." Orientation anchors (abandoned train, carousel car, morning light) arrive early and remain stable. However, closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the carpenter's state at the end mirrors his state at the beginning—he continues building, surrounded by the same grace and possibility. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("brokenness could sing, abandoned things were simply waiting") rather than landing a charged image that reconfigures prior material. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a forfeited path, a trade-off, or a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (prime hours, curved space, analog memory accumulating) and deepens through Cordelia's ritual walk, which thickens atmosphere and bends lamplight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the library "remembers itself," patrons feel it, and the final image crystallizes the pocket dimension where "science and story shared the same strange, beautiful space." Cost is conceptual—boundaries soften, reality warps—felt in the graduate student's startled whisper and the scarf growing warm. The piece holds its lens cleanly, orientation anchors early, and one meaningful tightening (the walk at 4:17 AM) reweights the dominant stake. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (lighthouse library, Mara's search, Theo's journal cipher) and builds through a causally linked sequence: cipher discovery → photography expeditions → cave revelation → Theo's appearance → Mara's choice to follow. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara paints her own coordinates and begins to shimmer, crystallizing her decision to abandon the library and join Theo's state of being. The cost is legible—she forecloses her librarian life—but the final image of "stepping forward into the light" leans toward lyric assertion rather than a fully dramatized forfeiture with visible friction on the page. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density increases through overlapping light-language motifs, and the ending reweights the premise (dreams as inhabitable spaces), qualifying as closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The nexus setup, ribbon coordinates, and descent into the room create a pattern, and the final "new locksmith" line offers a reconfiguration. However, the Orientation Test applies: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~100+ words of atmospheric scene-setting before "Mara" names the POV), and the disorientation itself is told ("sense of direction dissolve") rather than embodied through Mara's perceptual breakdown. The closure lands (Mara's transformation), but the cost—leaving her old life, confronting systemic fear—is implied rather than made legible on the page. No specific sentence shows what Mara forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Dr. Vera Kolchak, underwater greenhouse, present investigation). The causal chain from memory loss → research → mushroom discovery → plucking → recovered memory holds cleanly under a Causal lens. The closure delivers Decisive Change with visible cost (she reclaims memories by consuming what was hoarded), and the final image of ascending with mushrooms reweights the preservation theme. One micro-wobble: the commune member's exposition does minor lifting work that could be more dramatized, but the core turn (plucking the mushroom) is earned and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the archivist demonstrates tea-leaf reading, shares reversible-exile theory, and both characters move toward mutual understanding. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page cost—Finn begins copying annotations and the archivist names her fear, but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a charged image that reweights prior pressure, reducing the RR to a soft convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers symbolic density (seed, mist, wonder-light) toward a final planting image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (seed transformation → planting → promise of restoration), but the cost remains abstract—Mara feels "exhausted" yet no specific option is foreclosed or tactical sacrifice shown on the page. The midpoint weaving lacks a reversal or complication that would tighten pressure; the essence "resisted at first" but yields immediately to her song, removing friction before it can escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fisherman solidifies, names become starlight) with conceptual cost legible in "no longer drowning anyone in their unspoken weight." The pattern of knot-by-knot release accumulates pressure and reweights the dominant stake (grounding the spirit through exhumation of silence). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One tightening deepening occurs as the net dissolves and the fisherman's voice "no longer echoed," fulfilling the 600–800 word expectation for meaningful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, vault, rain, cataloging work) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through discovery of the shifted stone, recognition of the question-mark cracks, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maren leaves doors open and commits to the unknown, reweighting her stance from preserver to interpreter with visible cost (abandoning sealed certainty). The closure lands on the page with conceptual and opportunity cost: she steps away from the safety of locked documentation toward an unanswered question. One meaningful deepening (realizing the vault asks rather than declares) tightens stakes and alters her trajectory under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena's deliberate choice to leave the snow globe forecloses her collection/solution path with visible cost. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal choices within Accumulative/Textural density), held coherently to closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (Dr. Elena Marsh, SS Persephone library, 300 feet down). One meaningful tightening occurs when she writes in her own notebook, then removes the globe from her bag—narrowing from observer to participant to renunciant. Cost is legible: "some small planes should remain forever in flight."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (flower press, graffiti, ghost) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost gains voice. Orientation anchors (misty courtyard, Moth, lightning) arrive early. The closure effect—mutual recognition between Moth and the ghost—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the ghost's isolation acknowledged, Moth's craft validated), but the price feels asserted rather than dramatically tested. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the ghost's gratitude arrives without friction, and Moth's wandering continues unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the elevator's floor-by-floor climb accumulates diary revelations that reweight Maren's promotion decision. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—she will transform service into care—but the cost is declared rather than felt on the page; no visible forfeiture or narrowed option is dramatized in the final beat. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (brass elevator cage, sky fortress, servant role anchored by line 2). The because/therefore linkage from goggles-reveal to decision feels thin; the diary's content doesn't dramatize a present obstacle she must overcome, only a thematic invitation she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered observations (lenticular, cirrostratus, virga, stratocumulus) that reweight the dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image ("full of everything the sky had ever felt, spooled into wholeness") reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (professional risk implied by "unauthorized project" and colleagues who would "question her fitness"). Orientation anchors quickly (gondola, three thousand feet, Antarctic plateau, tether broken six hours ago). One minor slip: the conceptual cost is strong but the felt personal price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through density of reflection anchored to the coin, the empty book safe, and the broken crown, culminating in the star-reflection addition—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights "fractally precise documentation" against "recognition" with clear conceptual cost. Orientation is prompt (artist, tree library, night before demolition by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "precision wasn't enough"—a cadence shift that narrows her interpretive frame and charges the final image. Cost is legible: she completes the portrait knowing it captures pattern without person, an honest failure that she carries into morning. The lens holds without contradiction and closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds pressure through layered discoveries (luminance, hopscotch, coordinates, Mara's disappearance) that converge in a Charged Poise closure—Celeste crystallizes her stance (hide evidence, continue plotting) with felt cost (risk, duplicity) visible in the final image of "innocent questions." Orientation is clean by paragraph two (airship, navigation chamber, Celeste's role). The escalation unfolds through revelation density and the final act reweights the opening curiosity with survival stakes. One weakness: the luminance below is noted but never revisited on-page after the initial observation, leaving that thread hanging without clear payoff in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent—pressure builds through layered images (frozen books, infinite mirrors, rusted gears) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mechanism resumes with syncopated rhythm. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, fifth eclipse) land early. The closure—accepting imperfect repair as beauty—lands on the page with conceptual cost (world mechanisms remain fragile, other eclipses will come). One tightening: the discovery of the missing third gear forces improvisation. Causality is clean; the prophecy scraps motivate descent, the gears' condition dictates repair sequence, and the final turn reweights "perfection."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard planet, blight crisis) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara moves from solitary orchestrator to shared architect ("now, finally, she wasn't doing it alone")—with felt cost in her continued labor and the community's fragile interdependence. The causal lens holds: her messages prompt exchanges, exchanges rebuild trust, trust enables collective action. One meaningful tightening occurs when Joren and Elissa publicly commit. Cost is visible in the "brambled hope" and ongoing work, though the final beat's emotional price feels mild.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a single POV, one location, and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she completes the adjustment and accepts the ongoing burden). Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse keeper, dusk, Doomsday Clock mechanism). However, the closure unit—her descent with the puppet head and the whispered "We did what we could"—relies on thematic assertion rather than a dramatized cost that changes her options on the page. The adjustment itself is described in nested abstract phrases ("nested patterns of cause and effect," "seeds of reversal") without a concrete on-page consequence or sacrifice that we witness. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the ending reprises motifs (puppet head, nested patterns, lullaby) but does not reweight them with a felt price; the final image of locking the door and walking into darkness reads as closure but the cost remains conceptual and pre-established rather than newly crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Maren's inherited knowledge of the orchard's pattern allows her to navigate the maze and save the travelers before the mechanical birds and frost arrive. Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by the second paragraph), and the closure—her recognition of the orchard as gift rather than curse—lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting the duty). However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; we don't see what she's foreclosing or what stance she held before that made this acceptance meaningful. The blueprint mechanics are introduced late (midpoint) and resolved quickly, limiting the reader's chance to feel the discovery as earned rather than revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through Maya's reflective engagement with the ravine's physical features (foam patterns, chrysalis, five channels) until the scattering ritual reweights her understanding of separation and connection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she commits to reconnection with felt cost (facing grief, ending isolation). One tightening suffices at this length: her recognition that she's been severing connections shifts her stance from avoidance to engagement. Cost is legible in the final actions (calling parents, reaching out).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "glass orchard library" and "cloud-seas" but the nature of Vera's trade and the customer's precise goal emerge slowly through exposition rather than immediate action. The piece coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens—atmosphere and recurring images build toward the final gift—but the closure unit is a handoff with cost asserted ("one bottle sold, one story potentially rewritten") rather than dramatized on the page. The customer's departure to the reading grove defers the stakes test entirely; we don't witness whether the darkness works or what he sacrifices. The final paragraph loops back to opening language ("strange suspension," "infinite beginnings") without a decisive reweighting or felt price visible in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: recurring dream → journey → discovery of tidal pools → descent → memory work → resolution. Orientation anchors (fortress, Maron, post-rain) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with visible cost (Maron's tears, the fortress no longer weeping), and the drive lens holds. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maron moves from analysis to direct action. The cost is legible but could be sharper; the final image tells us the cost ("his own, this time") rather than showing physical or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean (tower librarian, midnight, valley below), and the causal chain from grain-hum observation to weight-attachment to community singing is legible. The closure moment—farmers walking between silos, teaching songs—does show a Decisive Change in the valley's social fabric, and Mara's theft of the weight carries a stated cost ("she'd have to explain that to the historical society eventually"). Yet that cost remains prospective and offstage; the on-page consequence is pure gain, which softens the closure's bite. The drive lens reads Causal with an Accumulative overlay (layered languages), held adequately but without a final tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, though the canyon's relevance remains vague until much later. The piece follows a hybrid lens—initially causal (Elena travels to canyon, sets up equipment) then shifts to accumulative/textural (memory flood, thematic layering). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "modified...the very nature of memory itself" and moonlight splitting into pathways. However, cost is asserted ("proving that nothing was ever truly lost") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off. The ellipsis between equipment setup and metaphysical breakthrough lacks motivated linkage, weakening causal credibility even under a hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the grotto visit layers detail and the inversion hour deepens atmosphere, building to a climactic touch that burns combinations into memory. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (archivist, manuscript, three days before inversion). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge acquired, path crystallized), and the cost—"fractured, forever accessible"—is conceptual rather than felt as a trade-off on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reenters during inversion, but the escalation is more atmospheric than choice-driven, and the final paragraph drifts toward mission statement rather than image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory density and craft detail toward a pattern-break moment when the birds return. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a Charged Poise variant): the birds' arrival crystallizes possibility and reweights prior material, though the cost remains implicit rather than sharply visible on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren moves from discovery to performance, and the final image reconfigures the grove's silence into "symphonic possibility." The piece holds its lens and delivers a legible closure effect, though the felt price of Maren's years of solitary labor could be more viscerally present in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story infers a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: the magnetic nexus scene accumulates psychic echoes (five distinct silences catalogued) and culminates in Kavir's realization, then the daughter's arrival shifts to a brief causal exchange that reweights the covenant's fate. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kavir remains at the nexus after yielding testimony rights, the final image recharging "what he'd sought in exile" with conceptual cost (he won't speak, the covenant may transform). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the silence correlation) tightens options and the handoff to the daughter forecloses Kavir's direct intervention path with felt cost, satisfying the length scope.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Marlow opens the clasp, reads the first line, then closes the diary in an Earned Stasis that forecloses immediate knowledge—a visible renunciation. The accumulative lens (frequencies, varieties of silence) holds through the ending image, and the cost is legible (she defers understanding after seventeen years). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (workshop, collapsed roof, sister's diary). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from mechanical unlocking to empathic listening, reweighting her goal from possession to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation early (treetop workshop, herbalist, three-year search) and follows a coherent Accumulative lens: planting → weeks of endurance → bloom → village sharing. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformed stance, and the conceptual cost (enduring what cannot be controlled) is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when her racing thoughts quiet in the flower's presence. The "tide of thought" phrase bookends effectively, but the village gathering at the end feels slightly convenient—villagers arrive "drawn by curiosity and by reports" without prior dramatization of that pressure building.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: water flows guide Mara through the Inversion to a temporal convergence that reveals the orchard's resilience mechanism. Orientation anchors arrive early (orchard pilot, Inversion countdown, floating arches). The closure—Mara discovering the temporal sphere and understanding resilience as multi-state existence—lands with conceptual repricing, though the felt cost remains oblique; she cradles the sphere but we don't see what she forfeits or how her world narrows. One meaningful deepening occurs when the phantom Cultivators demonstrate temporal layering, reweighting her search.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain from wind pattern discovery through container configuration analysis to worldwide alert, with clear orientation by paragraph two. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) as Mara transitions from retrospective accident analysis to prospective disaster prevention, with the cost legible in her transformed professional stance. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative elements; the closing beats show tightening through data convergence that narrows options and validates her methodology. One concern: Chen's manifest discovery arrives conveniently at the pivot moment without prior setup, creating a minor causal seam.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's recordings convince the Council—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible proof, but the cost (her risk, the Council's shift) is told rather than shown in the final beats. The amber sheet and sculpted hush unfold through aurora-light imagery, yet the causal linkage between striking the ice column and obtaining Council-convincing data feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible friction or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (Maren steps through the fold) with visible cost (abandoning return to the monastery). The piece holds a Causal lens through motivated escalation: guardianship ends → she seeks the answer → discovers the flute's purpose → steps through. Minor orientation delay (Thunder-Echo Range's nature unclear until paragraph two) but the effect does not harm closure. One meaningful tightening when she plays beyond two notes and commits.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens but delivers only thematic density, not a decisive tightening or cost at closure. The operator arranges type, presses fragments, examines patterns—repeated moves without narrowing options or altering knowledge. The ending restates the opening premise ("seeking the equation") without a visible change in stance or foreclosed path. No on-page reversal or Charged Poise moment crystallizes options; the final image ("steady as a heartbeat, patient as the mathematics of the dying sky") offers metaphor but no felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: each encounter vibrates sympathetically and builds toward the Keeper's thematic statement. Orientation anchors by line 3 (Kael, ridgeway, aurora). The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael receives the pendant back and commits to planting the seed, reweighting his role from passive courier to active cultivator of wonder. However, the Keeper's exposition ("Relics don't carry magic...") tells rather than dramatizes the transformation, and the cost of this new responsibility remains abstract rather than felt. The final descent with the warm seed offers image but not a decisive narrowing of options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (quartz arbor, dawn mist, Elena's purpose). The drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: Hartley's arrival and frost revelation tighten Elena's professional stake, and the decision to photograph offers Charged Poise—options crystallize (university committee, shared testimony) with felt urgency. However, the cost at closure is implied rather than legible on the page; we see resolve but no forfeited path or visible price in the final beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hartley agrees to testify, yet the ending disperses into atmospheric summary rather than landing a final concrete image that reweights prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with visible cost: Mariko crosses the jigsaw frame, trading her place for Kenji's. The accumulative lens holds—each weaving detail, the amber bead's warmth, the jigsaw frame, and the grandmother's teaching cohere into the final threshold crossing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pattern locks into place and Mariko steps forward, narrowing options to a single committed act.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering (the silk's memory, the crystallized sap). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—trees budding, Mira planning next phases—lands as a Decisive Change (planet begins recovery) but the cost is abstract: "memories spent" doesn't translate to a felt or visible price that reconfigures Mira's options. The barter with the magician resolves too smoothly; no on-page friction or trade-off sharpens the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs (discovery → forging → threading → budding) but the escalation lacks a turn that narrows options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and parallel-universe layers build density until the sister's message crystallizes the stake. Closure operates as Charged Poise—Kael places the shard down and defers the choice, but the final image ("tasted like goodbye") reweights all prior material with undeniable emotional cost. The seventeen-minute hum provides rhythm but doesn't tighten options on the page; the escalation is contemplative deepening rather than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers lighthouse keeper isolation, anonymous confessions, Marcus's collapse, and Vera's reticence into a final choice that reweights all prior material. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera adds her page, acknowledging she's been "protecting everyone's truth but her own," and commits to continuing the chain—a refusal of prior silence with visible cost (exposure). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices here: the light dies, Marcus collapses, Vera ascends the haunted lantern room, and her writing transforms the bundle's meaning. Cost is legible in "hands shaking" and the self-aware line about carrying others' loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece orients who/where/when within the first paragraph; the lighthouse, Kael's ritual, and the post-newspaper timeframe anchor cleanly. The dominant stake ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is present but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the green light bends backward through time and people wake "confused but hopeful," but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page—no sentence or image shows what Kael forfeits or what path is foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light, laughter, and prophecy), which the piece holds, but the closure lacks a decisive price that the reader can point to in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when), and the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through Chen's revelations about Yuki's legacy, the morpho-wing metaphor system, and Mira's decision to stay. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via commitment to apprenticeship), but the cost remains oblique—no visible forfeiture or consequence dramatized on the page, only the promise of future work. One meaningful deepening occurs when Chen explains "iridescent caution" and Mira recognizes the burden, but the final image ("learn to carry Yuki's legacy without being consumed") tells rather than shows the stakes. The lens holds, but the ending could charge harder with a concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through repeated tree-by-tree extraction until the pattern crystallizes meaning at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly (Mara, tower base, midnight shift). The final image—dreams dissolving into fountain water to nourish new seedlings—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the labyrinth's cyclical witness-and-release function is revealed), and conceptual cost is legible (sorrow must be extracted and transformed; trees will absorb anew). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara witnesses the moonlight transformation, reweighting her understanding of maintenance work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure lands—dawn breaks after seventeen years of night—but the final cost reads conceptual rather than felt on Elora's body or options. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through the song-weaving ritual, and the ribbons-to-oak sequence tightens density adequately. However, the mica window's "desperate faces" and the oak's "exists simultaneously in both worlds" arrive as convenient backstory rather than constraints dramatized earlier, weakening the sense that this exact weaving was the only path. The Orientation Test passes: who/where/when anchor by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the laundromat at 11:47, and the impossible library architecture provides a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Iris opens the book to "read herself back into the world." The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crumpled invitation, coffee shop recognition, and library descent build density toward the woman's paradox reframing. Cost is legible in Iris's five-year pattern foreclosed by her choice to return. One structural seam: the wedding backstory arrives mid-story rather than anchored early, briefly disrupting forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density of vanishings, guerrilla gardens, and the bread's warmth build pressure toward the final seed-planting realization. Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, courtyard, post-vanishing city) within the first paragraph. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the journals will now map gardens, reweighting documentation from elegy to transformation. The cost is conceptual (accepting forgetting) and felt (giving up pure preservation), made legible in "forgiving myself for remembering" and the pocket seeds. One meaningful deepening—from recording loss to nurturing growth—suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (reweighted purpose): Maren's work shifts from documenting fade to watching for rare endurance, with visible emotional cost (tears, allowed smile). The accumulative lens holds—density increases through measured slides building to the 528-hertz anomaly. Orientation anchors early (frozen library, Keeper Maren, her role). One meaningful deepening occurs when the extraordinary slide reframes her entire mission, though the cost could press harder on what she foregoes by staying in this isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the pirate-market frame is clear. Drive lens reads Causal: Nelle's choice to play the recording forces Crenshaw's capitulation, narrowing both parties' options to mutual silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (truce as Earned Stasis): she walks away with copies as insurance, foreclosing revenge but securing her father's name—cost is legible in "we're strangers" and her solitary exit. One small seam: "curious steadfast despite the flutter" feels like authorial assertion rather than dramatized contradiction, but it doesn't break causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Opening anchors who/where/when cleanly (Mira, bluff, election night). The compass needle's progression (spinning → settling on Kael → pointing to valley) creates a pattern that deepens meaning. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's theory reframes weather-carriers as planetary messengers, and the compass pointing to the valley where "human and more-than-human democracy converged" charges the final image with conceptual cost (accepting this role forecloses the skeptic's stance). One meaningful tightening occurs when the needle settles on Kael, validating Mira's hypothesis and narrowing her interpretive options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered memory, suppressed creativity, and the mother's hidden work, culminating in Elena's cathartic drawing session that reweights the premise. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release) with visible cost—bleeding fingers, exhaustion, hours spent. Orientation anchors are clear early (Elena, caverns, post-closure, following a summons). One minor slip: the "summons she couldn't explain but felt compelled to answer" borders on convenient mysticism, but the mother's note and storage-unit discovery provide enough causal grounding to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (Veridium, gilded-leaf calligrapher, toxic sky). Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture—Mira discovers the map, follows it, and arrives at the Archive where she accepts a role. The closure unit is a Charged Poise moment ("Show me how to deliver what was meant to be heard") that crystallizes her new stance, but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally present on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid in the final beat. The oasis-dried backstory and multi-level descent provide texture but the because/therefore chain from map discovery to acceptance is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what she carries). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the ice's transformation of bell tones, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira understands her purpose and commits to teaching others. The closure lands with conceptual cost (accepting imperfection over technical mastery) that reweights the opening premise. One tightening—ice melts, tones shift, revelation follows—is sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): M4-RY renounces erasure, buries the core fear to transform rather than contain it, and returns to tending—a stance crystallization with visible cost (the static remains but resolves into "discordant harmony"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens that coheres through the box-opening sequence and the photograph discovery, culminating in the burial that reweights all prior collection. Orientation anchors (android, dome, post-shift world) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when M4-RY discovers the hidden photograph, narrowing the escape plan and forcing a different resolution. The watering final image charges prior rose imagery with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a causal chain: locket → key → mailbox → documents → community mobilization. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (Marissa, courtyard, Saturday morning). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the community gathers with "absolute certainty," options crystallized but cost deferred off-page. The final image ("sandstorm would pass") asserts resilience without showing what path has been foreclosed or what immediate price the gathering will pay. Cost is conceptual (solidarity) but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    No on-page closure unit. The story ends with a summary of future success ("tomorrow, seventeen prisoners would walk free") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that lands in scene with visible cost. The piece reads as setup and context rather than a complete narrative arc—Elara's night of work is recounted, but no specific problem crystallizes, escalates, and resolves within the frame. Orientation is clear early (sunken lab, Elara alone), but the lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage nor accumulative pressure builds to a meaningful tightening that forecloses a path with felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page with felt cost: Maris enters the heart and is deleted from the world, "another transformed thing," while recovering her memories. The causal lens holds: whale beaches → gravity fails → Maris traces pattern → discovers memory repository → enters with visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors cleanly (docks, three days post-beaching, dusk rounds). One meaningful tightening: scattered flowers point to the heart, narrowing her path to a single irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the summoner gathers elements (starflower paper, mapped silence, tranquil blaze) toward a ritual climax that hushed the prophecy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she returns to her cottage to fold another wing, accepting perpetual solitary labor with the cost of ongoing vigilance. The cost is conceptual (unending isolation, unseen labor) and legible in "silence, like any garden, required constant tending," though one might wish for a sharper on-page price paid in the climax beat itself. The narrative teaches its pattern early and holds the lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens: Elena's search for academic cover motivates the weekly visits, Mrs. Kovac's observation of her true ability precipitates the confrontation, and Elena's choice to accept real teaching constitutes a Decisive Change that forecloses the "agreed upon lie" path with visible cost (abandoning the safety of academic explanation). Orientation anchors cleanly (rooftop, Thursday evening, meteor shower context) within the first 150 words. One pressure point—the revelation and offer—tightens options and the cost (exposure, commitment to an occult inheritance) is legible in "feeling its weight settle into her palm like a key she'd been searching for."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure unit is Earned Stasis: Mira writes her refusal, foreclosing the path to recognition and cementing her independence-through-isolation with visible cost (remaining misunderstood, garden never shared). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered reflection and the recurring shell/flower images, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn that reweights the dominant stake (preservation vs. legitimacy). One meaningful deepening: the envelope's arrival yesterday frames the present choice, and the final placement of the shell at the garden's center charges the ending image. Minor friction: the "because/therefore" linkage between sister's erasure and Mira's archiving method is largely told rather than shown through on-page discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid (the Magistrate's arrival complicates, the key reweights understanding). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the key transforms from physical object to "permission itself," reweighting Mei's prior forgeries as sanctioned rebellion with visible cost (the Magistrate's imminent removal). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mei realizes "every calibrated treason—you knew," which narrows her understanding and charges the final image. Cost is legible: the Magistrate will lose his position in three days, the grain reaches the village, and Mei inherits the unfinished work. The ending lands with felt consequence under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes, progressive disclosure motif, lyric atmosphere). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Mara's decision to sing and teach, but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no path is visibly foreclosed, no immediate sacrifice dramatized. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words. The shell's progressive revelations provide structure, yet the sister's preserved message feels convenient rather than causally earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (shrine, glacier, Maya, diving suit, candles) and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual assembles meaning through layered backstory (seventeen dreamers, three months, snow globe from wreck) toward a final image of salvage and knowledge that reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"some things survive even drowning"—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; Maya wraps the globe and prepares to surface without visible forfeiture or altered tactics. The because/therefore linkage is clean (Maya dives → retrieves globe → summons Katherine → promises delivery), but the final beat lacks the immediate price or narrowed option that would elevate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Kenji, parapet, post-rain evening). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (nets, moon paths, fireflies, whisk spirals) that converge at closure when the girl takes the net with "new intentionality" and the shared silence becomes "holy." The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) is legible—the apprentice's stance crystallizes, the cost is opportunity (she must now see failure as teaching) and the final image reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kenji explains hidden effort, altering her understanding and approach.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Vera investigates → finds shredded documents → reassembles them → discovers the diamond → chooses to protect it. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the debunker becomes guardian) with visible cost (she'll publish findings but obscure coordinates, compromising her pure-truth mission). Orientation is clean, the lens is causal throughout, and the final turn reweights her stance. Minor deduction for the ease of the excavation—someone tried to hide evidence but left soil "still loose," softening the discovery's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid: fragmented signals cohere into direct contact, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Closure is Charged Poise—"The rise had begun. The allegiance had shifted"—but the cost remains assertion rather than demonstrated loss; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation anchors late: "three years alone" and "observatory" appear early, but the cobalt portico and storm context take several paragraphs to solidify spatial grounding. The prophet's test-and-invitation structure is told in retrospect ("had been waiting for her specifically") rather than earned through on-page reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Cosima's collecting practice deepens through the music box repair and culminates in the public jar-opening and the gift exchange. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Decisive Change): the gift forecloses ownership but reweights her poverty into purpose, with visible cost (coins, community recognition). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The because/therefore linkage from finding the box → learning repair → capturing the lullaby → public performance → gift to Mrs. Chen is clean and motivated, with one meaningful tightening when Mrs. Chen's recognition validates the entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. The key's discovery → recognition of its properties → threat arrival → re-tuning forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure lands on-page: Meris alters the key's frequency to lock it to her pulse, a Decisive Change with felt cost (she becomes a permanent guardian, "the key had become part of her"). The boat's approach provides external pressure, though the antagonists remain abstract. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored in the opening paragraph). One meaningful tightening occurs when the silent boat appears, narrowing Meris's options and forcing the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through recursive imagery (basalt, viaduct, moon) and seasonal observation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The ending achieves Charged Poise—"one mapper, one moon, one frozen lake"—crystallizing Ren's patient revolution as a before/after stance with conceptual cost (isolation, generational break) made legible. One meaningful deepening occurs as her nightly practice accumulates into an argument "written in light and time." The cost is felt but oblique; the final image reweights the opening restlessness without a sharp on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Elena's discovery of the chamber → reading Malcolm's documentation → realizing Reeves's corruption → uploading evidence and declaring extended investigation. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (professional rupture, confrontation signaled by Reeves's silence). One weakness: the convenience of three journalists' numbers "kept for a moment exactly like this" slightly undercuts earned causality, though the final image of Elena holding the lantern reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eliana commits to months-long restoration with visible cost (time, skill, uncertainty) and the heart will serve as witness in the prison program, reweighting prior judgment. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Marcus's arrival with the letter motivates Eliana's reassessment, and the piece accumulates images (dust motes, storm clouds clearing, light streaming in) that modulate meaning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the letter reframes the heart from "hopeless" to "waiting," narrowing options and deepening stakes. Cost is legible in Eliana's commitment and Marcus's ongoing witness, though the final beat ("bearing witness in the calm before understanding fully arrived") slightly softens the immediacy of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece orients cleanly (Mal, workshop, acid sea, yearning algorithm by ~100 words) and moves through recalibration beats toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell tower resolves into clarity, and Mal sets coordinates, crystallizing her trajectory. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the kaleidoscope, arrow tip, and signal pattern—culminating in a cadence shift ("of course the bell was always there"). Cost is conceptual (the bell "only existed because she'd built a machine to hear it"), legible but oblique; the final act is launch, not renunciation, so the price feels more anticipated than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: Elena discovers the 1408 pattern → finds the patches → unlocks the quarantine folder → understands the crew's fate → decides to follow. Closure is a Decisive Change (she commits to transcendence) with conceptual cost (leaving behind her corporeal existence and official duties). Orientation anchors quickly (archive room, SocialSphere Inc., Elena's role). One minor slip: the materialized patch "warm despite existing only as photons" strains internal logic without clear rule-teaching, but doesn't break the causal chain to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Maren, lighthouse orchard, today, after a failed mediation. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the mirror-fragment revelations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Maren "understands finally how to translate pain into recognition" and the shadows gain "starlight." Cost is present but oblique: she has spent hours among the mirrors and her shadows have changed texture, yet the exact price of this new method and what she has foreclosed remain implied rather than viscerally legible on the page. The closure reweights her gift without a decisive physical act or visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through Vera's voluntary immersion in disaster relief work, listening to "the particular frequency of places approaching their final season." The closure—postponing consultation and staying through seasons—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (she forgoes medical answers to remain present). The cost is legible: she trades resolution for sustained attention, and the parasol's tip wears smoother as she "tested her own hollow spaces." One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from seeking permission to understanding "the approach itself was part of the song."

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the vineyard-as-metaphor pattern, anchors who/where/when early, and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: they accept permanent separation with visible cost). The cost is legible in "two people who could never be together" and the dawn walk that acknowledges their mismatch. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elena reveals the letter's true content, reweighting their shared history. Slight deduction for the explain-everything final paragraph that mechanically ties the metaphor rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Senna, parapet beneath dunes, three days post-prophet). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the fading clearings, Senna's mapping of "pockets," and the consecration ritual that reweights the stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the clearings hold through collective attention and ritual, a form of Charged Poise with the cost of ongoing maintenance visible). One meaningful deepening as Senna moves from reconnaissance to consecration. Cost legibility is clean: "They would need maintenance—a line walker's regular visits, the community's gentle attention—but they would hold."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through the layered act of completing arcs across an afternoon, deepening the townspeople's permission to imagine beyond loss. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the factory ruins shift from symbols of ending to "the beautiful, necessary work of beginning again" and the group commits to return, crystallizing a collective stance. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific on-page forfeit or friction; no individual choice narrows options or faces a trade-off that charges the final image with felt price. The ending's "Same time next week?" and nods feel like gentle consensus rather than a decision that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern accumulation (crystal observations, children's speech analysis) builds toward the final reconfiguration where Elara commits to testifying with a new understanding. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she stands ready to reframe the linguistic collapse, reweighting prior material. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (library, dawn, Council summons). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sonic resonator reveals language compression rather than loss, shifting her stance. Cost is implied but legible: she must speak despite terror, advocating transformation over preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through recurring fog/videotape/erasure imagery and breaks pattern at closure when the prophet *captures* the sound he sought—a conceptual repricing that reweights "loss" as "devotion." The closure lands on the page with visible cost: he will forget tomorrow, the markers will vanish, yet "for this crystalline moment" he holds it. Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. One minor slip: the shift from "locate something he'd lost three days from now" to "capture it" reads as a modest goal drift rather than a motivated pivot, but the final image holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kenji accepts the moon's departure and restructures instruments to witness change rather than preserve constancy, foreclosing the restorative path with the visible cost of abandoning fixed parameters. The causal lens holds—tremors prompt inspection, spinning hand resists stilling, orbital decay discovery forces recalibration choice—though the middle sags into extended reflection that delays the restructuring turn. Cost is legible in the line "Let it spin. Let everything reach for the velocity it needed."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through music, memory, and the ticking clock. Orientation is prompt (hospice, Mr. Chen, 48 hours). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (reconciliation with vinyl fragments held together), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page: we don't see what Rebecca or Mr. Chen surrendered to achieve reunion. The transition from letter-writing to Rebecca's arrival compresses thirty hours in a single paragraph, eliding the middle escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs (Maya's counsel shifts Mr. Chen's approach), satisfying the length allowance, but the final image ("two broken pieces learning they could still make music") abstracts rather than anchors the cost in concrete action or dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors orientation cleanly (observatory, Mira, post-spoon-bending world) and follows a causal lens: discovery of key → decipherment → insight about loops → mechanical adjustment → restoration of shadow-cycle. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes the observatory itself is trapped and must relearn its path. However, the closure—shadows becoming "luminous threads"—arrives without on-page cost or foreclosed option; Mira achieves her goal cleanly, leaving the key in place with no visible sacrifice, which weakens the Decisive Change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes orientation quickly (Dr. Marianne Clare, Blackwood estate maze, post-millpond discovery) and operates under a Causal lens: substitute body discovery → maze walk → tooth recognition → Iris's appearance → teaching offer. The closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise: Marianne's "Teach me" commits her to bridge-world bone setting, foreclosing her prior rational certainty. The garden brightening signals acceptance of the new reality. Cost is felt in her abandonment of the "comfortable prison" of certainty, though the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("how to make light from fractures") slightly softens the immediacy of that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's gallery builds through repeated acts of polishing and positioning, culminating in a pattern-break when children arrive and the final green piece completes the array. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she has transformed her loss into a pedagogical sanctuary, and the cost (Elena's absence, the burnt archive) is felt in "a little girl smiled at colored light, finally brought down to earth." One meaningful deepening: the shift from solitary grief-work to shared teaching. The "tomorrow" repetitions in the penultimate paragraph feel like soft reset rather than earned consolidation, slightly diluting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through the data-center setting and converging on the notebook reveal. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya accepts the notebook and invites Dr. Chen deeper into the space—but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt on the page. The notebook's reveal that Jenna "understood" flattens rather than deepens the stakes, offering absolution Maya claimed not to seek. One meaningful deepening occurs (the sister's posthumous forgiveness), but the final image of "two witnesses learning to dream awake" gestures toward transformation without demonstrating what Maya has renounced or forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story accumulates visions in the mist until the novelist's understanding deepens. Orientation is clear early (novelist at ruined lighthouse, seeking endings). The closure—choosing to give the protagonist "the harder third thing"—reconfigures the mercy-versus-vengeance binary with conceptual cost (the burden of perpetual witness). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist's shape of hope crystallizes. Cost is felt but largely internal; the on-page consequence is a decision to write rather than a dramatized forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through sensory density and ritual enactment toward a reweighting of the "forgetting" premise. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: the machine proves the remedy exists, shifting from private experiment to communal restoration. However, the cost remains conceptual (the village's prior skepticism) rather than felt on Cassian's body or psyche. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines) and the lens holds, but the final image of fruit-distribution is more plan than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered description and ritual action toward a final image of captured heartbeat-maps. Orientation anchors (Vera, orchard, crater, subarctic twilight) arrive early and remain stable. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard's longing made legible through the maps), but cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized: we're told the maps hold "persistence" and "hope," yet no on-page friction tests whether this effort succeeds, fails partially, or exacts a personal price from Vera. The sealing gesture completes the pattern but doesn't reweight prior material with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (locksmith, marble cavern, wounded season) within the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Marcus's mapping, reconstruction, and activation build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the timer conjures echoes and the survivors witness resilience. Closure lands with conceptual cost—wonder stored against future despair—legible in "when we forget how to hope, we can return here." One small causality slip: the leap from "reflections shifted" to "temporal echoes" is asserted rather than earned through intermediate discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece layers burdens in a mandala pattern, teaching the recursive structure early and paying it off when "the patterns had stopped multiplying." Orientation is clear (bronze grotto, post-snowmelt, fractal weaver protagonist). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis: she emerges carrying the burner, leaving the crystals, and her hands now move in "simple, singular gestures," which reconfigures her stance and forecloses the recursive trap. The cost is legible in the transition from infinite possibility to singular action and in the time spent (three seasons → second snowmelt). One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands she is "becoming the trap itself," reweighting her role from collector to container, which narrows her options and charges the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Margot completes the carving into a deliberately imperfect bowl, forecloses the path of monument-making, and accepts incompleteness with visible cost ("finished and unfinished both"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain imagery, the kettle's progression, and wood-grain rings accumulate toward the final image of the bowl held to light, reweighting "here and gone" from loss to transformation. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (widow, loft, ash wood blank). One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands Roland's paralysis and begins cutting. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: she sits with something "that could hold, at last, the weight of everything it had been."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts her ghost-self, relinquishing negotiation, with visible cost (camera wheel lost, former resolute self merged). Orientation is delayed—who/where/when solidifies only around line 5–6 ("kinetic lagoon," "carousel stopped three days ago")—but the pattern of temporal disorientation is taught early and pays off thematically, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of fragment-collection, erosion imagery, and the ghost's approach build pressure through pattern and cadence rather than strict because/therefore linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost offers memory rather than stolen fragment, shifting Mira's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena sends the proposal knowing rejection is likely, and the final image ("already seeing green where there was only gray") reweights the terminal's decay into potential with undeniable pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through overlaid blueprints, thermal scans, and the sextant's navigational metaphor, culminating in a cadence shift that charges hope with on-page cost (professional risk, attachment to a doomed structure). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One constraint shapes tactics: the existing water-damage infrastructure enables her hydroponic vision, foreclosing demolition as the only option.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: clock scribe, sanctuary courtyard, dawn after a storm. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—deepening through reflection and image rather than causal linkage—and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she decides to return and apprentice, reweighting her resignation from abandonment to reclamation). Cost is present but soft: she will face "mockery or hardship," a declared price rather than one paid on the page. The backstory block is substantial (~30% of the text) but anchored to present stimuli (the sketchbook, the crystals) and interleaved with micro-choices (kneeling, sketching, speaking aloud), meeting the Reflection-led exception. No causality break, and the lens holds, but the ending resolves more by assertion than by a final image that charges prior material under undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrete (sundial, canal glow, blueprints) toward a final image of understanding. Orientation is anchored adequately by ~120 words (barge canal, twilight, Viktor's journals). However, the closure unit lacks felt cost—Mira's realization that "Viktor had vanished" into his own architecture and that "lies weren't obstacles to truth but pathways toward it" is a Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost remains abstract and unexplored. The ending tells us she "sat with the serene upheaval of understanding" without demonstrating what path this forecloses or what she must now give up. The piece teaches its pattern but the final reconfiguration feels more like arrival at an answer than a meaningful tightening with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes Mira's quest clearly (decode the rope, preserve knowledge) and delivers an on-page discovery sequence culminating in the birch-bark map. However, the closure reads as confirmation rather than decisive change—she photographs, re-seals, and feels "satisfied," with no visible cost or narrowed options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through serial knot-opening, but the final image does not reweight prior material or impose conceptual cost; instead it restates the premise ("holding rope that held memory"). No meaningful tightening or trade-off foregrounds a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Maren in the garden, the Duchess in the eastern wing, post-ship departure. The dominant stake—mapping the Duchess's return to embodied life—is signaled early and tightens through the thread object and the conversation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the hand squeeze and Maren's framing ("intermission...between the person one was and...might still become") crystallize a before/after with felt cost (the Duchess's tears, years of absence). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (garden, carpet, thread, tears) and the final cadence shift reweights the stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when the thread connects past and present, though the Duchess's shift feels more invited than forced by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation cleanly and follows a causal arc from retrieval through incubation to hatching. The closure lands with a visible hybrid creature—a Decisive Change that reweights the premise of pure restoration versus compromise. However, the egg cracks "from within" without prior setup of internal viability, introducing a convenience that bypasses earned agency at the pivotal beat. The palace's quaking bookends the story but does not meaningfully constrain or enable the laboratory sequence, reducing structural integration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by ~90 words (Maya at the obsidian lagoon with her satchel and Elena). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered metaphors (obsidian, grafting, the drilled coin) accumulate toward the final image of black sand as "small scars...each one singing." However, the closure unit—Elena's realization and smile—lacks visible cost; the transformation is asserted ("understanding grafted itself onto grief") rather than paid for by a forfeited path or painful acknowledgment. The radio crackle offers a gesture toward stakes but doesn't force a trade-off. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration by cadence shift, but the cost remains felt rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately in the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumbs → constellation → box → memory release builds through linked images and density increase. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—memories are freed, fountains fill, and Mira walks away enriched without forfeiting skepticism, relationship, or future option. The "evolved doubt" is conceptual repricing attempted, but the final image ("questions that glowed brighter than answers") remains abstract assertion rather than a reweighting with undeniable pressure or felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the light-sharing gift and the Keeper's departing wisdom reweight the survival stakes with conceptual cost (the gear's "calculations finally complete" signals the end of pure measurement). Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern, image density, and cadence shift rather than because/therefore causality. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Keeper moves from observer to actor, and the cost (the mother's terror giving way to trust) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (carver, greenhouse, monarchs, Marcus dead seven months). The accumulative lens holds: the ribbon's verses build pressure, Marcus's teaching reweights her approach, and the final act (writing her own poem) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts her stance from isolated carving to collective architecture. Cost is felt but oblique—she releases Marcus and accepts the mentorship role—yet the closure image ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") reconfigures the premise with conceptual weight. One meaningful deepening is present; the taught pattern (family poems as grief preparation) pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Maren inscribes truth onto the pendulum, releases it, and walks toward the sea with the emptied rake handle—a crystallized stance that forecloses her prior silence with felt cost (the town will never know, but she has acted). The piece coheres through density increase (carving detail) and cadence shift (mechanical rhythm to lyric drift). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One escalation beat: stopping the pendulum to carve truth is the meaningful tightening; releasing it completes the arc. Cost is legible in the final image: "carrying her brother's memory in brass and wood."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The structure follows a single continuous scene (tournament hall exit → silo investigation) with clear causal progression: chess loss prompts reexamination of symbols, leading to coordinate discovery and tomorrow's plan. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Marta crystallizes her next move with visible cost (the recognition that her grandmother preserved hidden truths, reweighting the tapestry and sovereign case). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the ending reconfigures prior material without requiring a dramatic physical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building meaning through the ritual of writing—but the closure lacks visible cost. Maren completes her task without dramatized resistance or trade-off; the vellum "glows faintly" and she walks away with hope intact. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending reconfigures nothing with felt consequence. The piece describes a visionary act without showing what it costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Elena), where (ember alcove), and what (waiting for pirate broadcast) within the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the broadcast fragments accumulate, Elena decodes them, and the final image of luminous dust reconfigures the story famine premise. However, the closure moment—Elena smiling and beginning to transcribe the method—lands as a plan rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost on the page. The ending tells us "The story famine was ending" without showing a visible price paid or a path foreclosed; the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the mask discovery, the garden ash-pattern reveal, and the final placement act. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena's decision to continue scattering "as acknowledgment rather than ending" reweights her ritual with felt cost (faith dispersed, safety revealed as mirage). Orientation anchors within 120 words (Elena, gallery, evening). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ash forms new words, reframing the founder's message and Elena's role. Cost is legible in "dispersing the components of faith itself," though the final image's felt price is more oblique than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean (Marcus, flooded ruins, post-plague, dawn descent anchored early). The piece follows a Causal lens: Karin's request narrows Marcus's options, his counter-proposal creates the network plan, and the cog becomes their sign—each beat motivated. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Marcus hands over his "most precious possession" and commits to a distributed method, foreclosing his solitary stance. One meaningful tightening (Karin's arrival forces the choice) is sufficient for this length. Cost is legible in the cog transfer and the final image of him alone "with the rising water."

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the library gathering and humming exercise build pressure toward the final reweighting of the zither rosette. Orientation anchors are clear by the second paragraph. The closure image (rosette returned to box, lesson resonating) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract—"difficult work of autumn and beyond" tells future consequence rather than showing present forfeiture. No on-page choice forecloses a live option with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the greenhouse becomes a pattern of restoration, memory-sharing spreads, and the final image reweights the opening ruin with "different future taking root." However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—authorities "eventually noticed" off-page, seeds "had spread," but no on-page price is paid by Mara herself. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a specific sentence where Mara's choice at the ending forecloses a legible option or exacts a visible personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (tower, post-blackout, Mira summoned) and follows a causal thread: Chen's algorithm change → drone hoarding → cascade failure → his need for an involuntarily honest witness. The closure is a Charged Poise/nascent Decisive Change hybrid—Mira accepts the truth-telling burden and they plan resurrection of wonder—with visible cost (her compelled honesty will force uncomfortable revelation tomorrow). The drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative coloring (nectar-light, bee motif). One meaningful tightening occurs when the riddle answer crystallizes the thematic stakes, and the final image ("ready for the next storm") reconfigures prior material with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through collected objects and ritual until the house exhales, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Mara's realization that her offerings are attention, not magic, reconfigures her method and charges the final image of the lit house. One meaningful deepening (objects → witness) tightens the dominant stake. Causality within the accumulative frame is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the statue's cascading memories deepen Marina's understanding in waves, culminating in her decision to "thread it through their certainties" with the ampoule as evidence—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options are crystallized and cost is felt. Orientation anchors early (Marina floats before the statue, oxygen gauge ticking toward red, underwater garden). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: Marina accepts the weight of carrying moral complexity upward, and the statue's final stillness marks the trade. One slip: the architect's backstory arrives as a large reflective block, but it anchors to the present discovery of the ampoule and tilts Marina's stance, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (infinite staircase, Mara, her dice and research past). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the staircase embodies her theoretical trap, Castellano's manifestation deepens the pattern, and the sideways step off the stairs reweights the premise with a micro-turn back to the waking office. Closure lands as Charged Poise—finger hovering, then pressing send—with conceptual cost (risking failure again) legible on the page. One minor causality seam: the transition from falling void to waking at desk elides mechanics, but dream-frame conventions permit this and the final image reconfigures prior particulars without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: insomnia ritual → painting visions → completion of phrase → sleep. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, Mara, insomnia context) arrive early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—Mara proves what she needs to herself and finally sleeps—with the cost legible in seventy-two hours of exhaustion and the broader defiance against erasure. The lens holds, but the closure relies more on atmospheric summation ("she'd proven what she needed to prove") than a single crystallized image or physical act that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The waxing moon and completed canvas charge the ending, yet the daydream sequence operates as thematic illustration rather than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers displacement imagery, the frozen waterfall as stasis metaphor, and the emerald lens as a vision-shifting device, building toward the collective thaw. Orientation anchors (grotto city, museum guide, post-freeze) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community chooses to "excavate themselves from history's tomb" with tools and bread, and the final image—"displaced…transformed by survival, their culture adapted but unbroken"—reweights prior material. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of permanent change, "adapted but unbroken") but the lens holds. One escalation point (discovery of fractures through the lens) tightens options. The museum's next relocation is declared but not dramatized, which slightly undercuts the stakes' immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Maren, lighthouse, low tide, present action. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—months of reverse-engineering culminate in the yoyo's activation, the hunger stone's transformation, and Maren's vanishing—with closure landing as a Conceptual Repricing where she steps "beyond fate's design" and the yoyo falls silent. Cost is conceptual: she leaves behind her lighthouse and vanishes into "a direction that had no name." The escalation is a single decisive intensification (the yoyo blooms, reality dissolves, she steps through) rather than causal tightening, which fits the lens. One slip: the yoyo's "four-dimensional knots" and "magnetic axle" are asserted but never constrain a prior choice or complicate her work, weakening the sense that the puzzle shaped her path.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Margot seeks understanding → advisor provides tool → unbosoming reveals fear's size → clasp traps it. Orientation anchors arrive early (funhouse, post-drowning). However, the core turn—fear becoming visible through confession—lacks clear because/therefore linkage; the mechanism by which speaking aloud materializes fear is unexplained within the world's logic. The closure (fastening the clasp, walking out with it as trophy) offers a decisive change, but the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what price she pays in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren's faith in the backwards-flowing current is validated, the orchard survives, and the final image of "copper-wound trees singing their impossible truth" reweights prior material. Drive lens is Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural accent: cloud patterns trigger interpretation, which triggers ballast adjustment, which enables survival. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex opens and the orchard drifts perpendicular. Cost is conceptual—trust in counterintuitive currents—but the personal or relational price to Maren remains abstract; pointing to an exact sentence where *she* pays a felt cost is difficult, limiting higher reach.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift (cartographer, outermost shell, three years post-gate). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: spirals → whistle → crack → realization that movement is survival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Maren grasps her purpose and the turtle responds. Cost is felt—she must challenge the Council's certainty and risk panic—but the price remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The closure crystallizes options (stay = death, move = survival) with undeniable pressure, qualifying as RR even though the turtle's shift is only beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors land cleanly (historian, station, letter pursuit). The lens reads Causal with a clear goal-pursuit structure. Closure occurs on-page—Elena secures the letter and commits to publication—but the cost remains abstract: "responsibility light in her satchel" signals relief rather than visible forfeiture. Hawthorne's reversal hinges on a single persuasive speech without prior signs of wavering, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds throughout. The discovery of the letters provides a meaningful deepening—the interlaced absence concept crystallizes when Marcus finds words "written but unread, felt but never received" and chooses witness over extraction. This qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (a choice to honor rather than salvage). The cost is present but muted: his decision to leave the letters sealed and add his own note reconfigures his mission, but the tension between professional duty and personal ritual never truly tightens into a binary that forecloses options. The closure lands but with soft pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (indexer, forgotten library, blackout three hours ago). The piece follows a causal lens: discovery of stamp → impression reveals phrase → journal retrieval → cross-reference → pattern recognition → renewed purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when the four anomalous volumes converge into evidence of a suppressed underground press, narrowing Mira's understanding and reweighting her cataloging mission. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose via conceptual repricing of the library's contents), with felt cost implicit in the commitment to "tracing honest origins of suppressed truths"—though the cost remains more thematic assertion than on-page forfeiture of a specific option or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (lantern maker, workshop, Vesper Isle, post-detachment) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mei commits to her thousand-crane project with visible cost (isolation, everything paid to the basilica, the luminous torment of her own lanterns). The accumulative pattern—polish, fold, release—deepens through the story and the final image of the brightening gem with "work to do" reweights the opening's trembling hands, making endurance legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph: Mira aboard a floating observatory, present tense, hunting atmospheric anomalies. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, sensor data, and the geode motif until the final image of "possibilities wait, neither dead nor alive" reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the hunt crystallizes into method and stance, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she detects the unusual standing wave and adjusts thrusters, narrowing her search.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid: the pilgrim's arrival crystallizes Mara's latent search into a concrete mission. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear promptly. Closure unit is Charged Poise—Mara accepts the quest and dispatches drones, reframing her isolation as purpose—but the cost remains conceptual and unproven on the page; no visible trade-off or forfeited option appears. The final image ("She would bring it home") asserts resolve without demonstrating what she risks or loses by committing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, when anchored in the opening paragraph). The causal chain from backstory crime → watch hand arrival → shore ritual → Elias confrontation → commitment to dismantle remains coherent. Closure is Earned Stasis: Mara accepts accountability and commits to ending her lies, foreclosing her former career with visible cost ("destroyed her soul," tomorrow's dismantling). The cost is named rather than shown in a final concrete action, which keeps it from the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, why). The lens reads as Situational: Katrin applies a taught method (moon-phase synchronization) to a static standoff, and closure arrives when both sides commit simultaneously. The exchange succeeds on the page with visible cost (three months of captivity, gauntness, wild beard), satisfying the Charged Poise form—options crystallize and the neutral ground holds. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moon emerges and both commanders nod. Minor causality gap: we're told Katrin has done this seventeen times, yet the commanders' decision to trust feels more like narrative convenience than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Marina's avoidance → Amy's request → Marina's refusal → Amy's shared vulnerability → Marina's weather calculation → the launch decision form a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina adjusts course "five degrees, felt the rightness of it in her bones" while paddling into open water—the final image crystallizes her shift from navigating away from mistakes to through them, with the vanishing utility poles marking the cost of leaving safety systems behind. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening (Marina surprising herself with "within the hour") narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the baseball, the Interpreter's wisdom, and the bioluminescent lake build thematic resonance. However, the closure unit—Marcus's decision to "choose to try"—lacks visible cost on the page; he simply walks away "carrying only the impossible baseball's lesson." The story gestures toward Charged Poise but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or a felt price. The cadence shift is present but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (orchard, Mira, post-phoenix world). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spice-scent ritual deepens into transformation, pressure accumulates through Tam's increasing solidity, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (they walk together, neither alive nor dead). Cost is legible—Mira is "no longer entirely human"—and the final image reweights the opening's separation. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift—who, where, when by the opening paragraph—and the causal spine is clear: she ascends to account for stolen time, sees the cost in three card-windows, and chooses to descend with a promise. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she renounces the search and commits to presence, forecloses the upward path, and the final image of reaching into the cradle reweights all prior material. Cost is felt (abandoning her cartomantic pilgrimage, accepting the weight of repeated presence) and the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive deepening. One minor slip: the phrase "Time… didn't need to be found. It needed to be given" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shimmer-patterns, photographs, and Tear build density toward a final charged image. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dimension begins to open, reweighting the entire shadow-work premise with felt consequence. Orientation anchors promptly (Mei, observation deck, post-last-human). The tightening is clear: Mei activates the apparatus, the Tear blazes, and both characters cross the threshold. Cost is legible in "both of them understanding finally" and the ship's impending transformation, though the price remains conceptual rather than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: lightning bugs released, texture pondered, detour completed. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—Mara reweights her state from destitute to "orchestrator of small miracles"—but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible in a forfeited option. The surveyor encounter functions as illustration of her new role rather than a causal turn that narrows choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (the texture realization) but it's delivered as reflection rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (vigilant lock sentinel, workshop, blackout). The Drive Lens reads as Causal with mild Situational coloring: the blackout was planned, Maren prepared the sundial, and the revolution unfolds as rehearsed. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the final image ("sparks of change began to glow") recaps the setup rather than altering options. The closure lacks visible cost: Maren smiles, others move with purpose, and the revolution proceeds on schedule. The piece ends in Charged Poise framing, but the stakes are asserted rather than tested, and no live path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The Fibonacci spiral builds through seventeen stones with increasing aurora and eel convergence, and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"the sacred geometry of letting go" reweights the grandmother's promise from explanation to invitation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The weakness: cost is conceptual and thematic but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture on the page; Korin completes the pattern without paying a price that alters her situation, and "understanding" substitutes for a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm, timer ritual, and poem-as-contraband motifs layer to reweight Mara's stance from wounded exile to active archive. Orientation anchors promptly (observatory, three months post-incident, poet under censorship). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she chooses to remain at her post, mapping scars—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the final beats, only a reaffirmation of prior commitment. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, but the ending restates rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (glass atrium, sundial, duel postponed). The closure—violence averted through puzzle-solving, leading to a rematch promise—lacks felt cost: Adelaine loses no face, Harwick's rage evaporates without consequence, and the "questions become destinations" motif remains asserted rather than dramatized through a price paid. The causal lens wobbles; the sundial solution arrives conveniently without prior constraint shaping their tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, rusted library, full moon, Kai) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): planting seeds "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" crystallizes the blooming-resistance stakes and reconfigures the library's ruin into purposeful fertility. Cost is visible in September's acknowledgment that October will forget this specific joy, and the act forecloses passivity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden seeds shift the evening from sorting books to seeding insurgent beauty, but the escalation is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Hybrid (Causal mechanics in the splicing sequence, Accumulative/textural in the station setting and longing motif). Orientation anchors appear by ~150 words (pianist, tidal arbor terminal, twilight, compasses). The closure unit—husband's return triggered by the spliced film-music performance—lands on the page but the causal linkage feels convenient: the mechanism (compasses triangulating across time via hidden film frames) is asserted rather than earned through prior rule-setting. The cost at closure is emotional reunion, but no visible price or foreclosed path accompanies it; the broken clock ticking backward gestures at temporal magic without dramatizing the stakes or sacrifice required.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Kima, ridge, pre-monsoon). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream fragments build density, Prem's arrival deepens the stakes, and the planting act crystallizes Kima's stance shift with visible cost (forfeiting verification for possibility). Closure is Charged Poise—the seed is planted, the monsoon looms, and the final image ("three days to discover what grows when faith and verification finally bloom together") reconfigures the opening tension with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: she has abandoned her oath's certainty for an unproven leap.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (compass, lace pattern, bonsai) that converge at closure when Mira "understood" her grandmother's instructions. Orientation is clear by paragraph one (Mira, islet, post-rain, carrying box). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira reweights her inheritance from loss to cultivation—but the cost remains abstract: we see her follow the lace pattern and work the bonsai, yet no on-page forfeit or visible trade-off crystallizes. The final paragraph tells us she "understood" rather than showing a choice that forecloses a path, muting the felt cost required for higher bands.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a conceptual repricing where Helena's realization about transformation reweights prior material with felt cost ("the scales glowed like stars"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality remains intact through patterned reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.5)
    Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation early; closure is a decisive change (Galloway bound, Vera creating) with felt cost in the confrontation and resilience. The lens holds without ambiguity, and persistent constraints (her adaptability) shape tactics. Cost is legible in the final image of frost melting as the kiln roars.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's body becomes an instrument, reweighting silence with cost legible in the final image of the tuning fork case pressed to her heart. Orientation is clear within 120 words, anchoring who, where, and when. The pattern of heat-mapping builds density, and the closure effect charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraints like her lost voice shape tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot follows a causal chain from the package to closure, with the library's impossible spaces shaping tactics; closure lands decisively as the ghosts fade, with cost legible in Marcel's exhaustion and the scholars' release.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under a Hybrid drive lens, with Mara's declaration reconfiguring community hope and intergenerational support. Cost is legible in the amplified quiet and the young woman's response, and causality holds from anonymous donations to public revelation without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Mei's understanding of transformed love reweights the premise with felt cost ("the old grief... began to unknot"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the persistent constraint of unused love shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Lyra's realization reweighting time's nature and her role, cost legible in the loss of photographs. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The halo fragment's persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the ending image charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Mira plants seeds, reweighting the premise with cost legible in "each seed a promise." Causal lens holds with because/therefore linkages (decoding keys leads to arrow, escape, planting). Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraints (chains, keys) shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Mira releases the crystal, reconfiguring her understanding of absence with felt cost.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV, single-location day that moves causally from aftermath (searching) to methodical salvage (collecting, analyzing) to conceptual closure (walking home under pulsars). The drive lens is accumulative/textural: each pass over butterflies vs neutron stars tightens the central question of how she relates to change and loss. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as she reframes decay and gradual change, with the price of that understanding legible in the ruined greenhouse and vanished butterflies. There are no orientation or causality slips, and the quiet build feels deliberate rather than static.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: explosion → charred ledger strip → nighttime retracing → frost tracks → cave → confrontation → deal and return. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the single transition back to the kiln is clear. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: Galloway is bound and bargained away, and Vera recommits to creation with a new understanding of the fire’s danger. The main structural weakness is how the crucial beat—disarming/binding a man with a pistol—is elided, softening the sense of cost and effort at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ferry accident → retreat into conservatory → experiments with heat-mapping → public installation → retrospective closure with the book and tuning fork. Causality is coherent and each phase grows out of the prior one; there’s a clear before/after in how Mara relates to sound and self. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the thermal maps reframe her loss and she presses the tuning fork case to her heart with new understanding. The main limitation is a relatively soft turning point—no discrete on-page decision sharply narrows options near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: package → dreams → decision to go → descent → restoration → release and return. The structure balances summary and scene well at this length, and the closure (ghosts released, Marcel’s dreams emptied) reads as a decisive before/after. Time-flow oddity in the library is purposeful and thematically motivated. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal, so while the arc is clean, it feels somewhat easeful rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from sanctions → secret aid network → recognition of anonymity’s limits → public reveal is clean and legible, and the story lands a credible closure when Mara declares herself and the youth accept the mantle. The single-scene frame at the arbor with embedded backstory is structurally sound and easy to follow. The main weakness is that the cost of declaring—legal danger, community backlash, risk to donors—remains largely conceptual, so the decisive change isn’t sharply tested on the page. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with a quiet, reflective texture; closure is solid but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous encounter that moves from setup through ritual to realization and release, with causality readable under an accumulative/textural lens. The past-life memory and therapy reference are efficiently folded in as context for the present quest rather than digressive backstory. Closure is strong: her understanding of unused love is reweighted and enacted through the physical offering of the jade tear. The only limitation is that external stakes are low and the pressure curve is relatively gentle, relying more on conceptual shift than hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from arrival with tools/photos → engagement with fragment → transformation of images → reconfiguration of the garden → revaluation of her condition and a charged return of the fragment. Causality is clear under the lyric premise: fragment responds to her, catalyzes the maze/time revelation, and the loss of photographs leads to a new mode of navigation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the before/after hinge on her reframing retrocognition and surrendering the old anchors. The main limitation is that the stakes never quite feel precarious; there’s no real doubt that accepting the maze-logic is the only possible end, so tension in the middle beats is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: months of planning → decoding the keys → retrieving the arrow → using the wall’s demolition and crowds as cover → planting seeds. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single transition from interior escape to exterior planting is smooth and motivated. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the global drive shifts from escape/evidence to the longer arc of restoration, with a felt conceptual cost. The main structural limitation is that everything proceeds without real setbacks, so the plan feels almost too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is clean: daughter’s silence → six-month obsession → current experimental attempt → discovery → choice to preserve or destroy → decisive act. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the world-building textures deepen pressure rather than digress, and each step tightens her options toward either weaponizing or relinquishing this knowledge. Closure lands as a decisive change with clear cost and before/after: she abandons the core project that has defined her drive for six months. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the narrative’s internal logic holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → code in flowers → meeting → revelation via moonbeams → decision to change vocation, all causally connected. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the drive lens (causal with a conceptual repricing at the end) holds. Closure is solid—Maya’s choice to leave the jar and walk out seeing golden hour differently is a clear before/after, though stakes remain primarily internal. Some beats (Celeste’s explanations of the artist and moonbeams) edge toward tidy exposition rather than dramatized discovery, slightly flattening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single continuous scene with a clear before/after: from static sanctuary to decision for reconnection and repurposing the space. Causality is intact: the bookmark, the metaphors about heat/rotation/trust, and the thawing river accumulate toward his choice to reach out and transform the control room’s function. Closure (a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration) is on the page with an implied relational cost. Escalation is subtle rather than dramatic but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: client → cast → rusted library → phone revelation → decryption → decision to go to authorities. The drive lens is firmly causal, and the closure is a decisive change with cost: Maya forecloses easy cynicism or complicity and commits to exposure despite personal and relational fallout. The single-scene structure with light reflection fits the length and maintains focus. If anything, the investigation/decryption feels slightly easy, with little on-page resistance beyond internal conflict, which keeps it short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: arrival → request → three silences → map → final darkness forms a clear progression. Causality is consistent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing where silence becomes navigational infrastructure—lands on the page. The commander’s situation changes from helplessness before useless charts to having a new “map” framed by absences, a before/after that is legible with existential cost. The only limiting factor is that the external situation (what they will actually do next) stays abstract, keeping the drive more conceptual than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene anchored around the violin, with prior loops summarized but causally feeding this iteration’s choice to play differently. The beat progression—arrival, context via Yemeni, approach to violin, playing and visualization of thought, realization—is coherent and accumulative. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: J-7’s understanding of consciousness and his loop’s meaning reweights everything before. Stakes are more philosophical than situational, but they’re legible and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: overheard confession → reevaluation of doodles via the lens → decision to answer in kind → direct approach to the booth. The piece maintains a single, continuous situation with one clear tightening turn when Mira recognizes the doodles as intended communication. Closure is decisive and on the page: she chooses to stop “eavesdropping on her own life” and act, with the risk of rejection implied. Stakes stay small-scale but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with backstory smoothly triggered by present objects and actions. The causal throughline—Marcus’s visit because of his “negative seven,” the vine dresser’s story of deception and reclamation, and the reweighting of what “measurement” matters—holds without gaps. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the Institute’s luck scale is reframed as trivial beside the garden’s non-quantifiable knowing, with the social cost of being “damned” left hanging against this private alternative. Stakes remain quiet but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where Kael sets up the nexus, demonstrates sideways time, and gains acknowledgment, with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—time and the Ephemera’s existence are re-understood, and Kael’s role is reweighted. However, the conflict is low-key and the path to success is quite smooth; there’s minimal sense that the attempt might fail or that revealing it could backfire. The piece feels complete but not structurally daring or high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is tightly structured as a single causal sequence: Marta experiments with notes, decodes the program, discovers Moretti’s name, receives the “TELL THEM” command, then commits to exposing the truth. Orientation is immediate (flooded opera house, musician in the pit), and the ghost-rules are internally consistent enough for this length. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Marta’s decision to act and the opera house’s “completion” once she has heard and acknowledged the ghost. The main weakness is that the cost of that decision stays mostly conceptual; we’re told she will disrupt the official history, but no concrete on-page consequence is yet forced.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: fever breaks → suspicion about the oracle → interrogation of marginal data → realization about mis-weighted uncertainty → architectural revision → new, doubt-capable oracle. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the illusion of fault-tolerance as safety is overturned, with Reeves’s death as the visible cost. Structure is straightforward single-scene and benefits from that clarity; no orientation issues. The only limitation is that all major turns are cognitive and proceed smoothly—no serious obstacles or near-misses test her change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative frame: radio confessions prompt exploration, valves are discovered and turned, shadows manifest, and the final valve produces a conceptual and sensory release. Closure is solid as a conceptual repricing of “ghost shift” into psychic guilt with the auditory image of a shift change, though the cost to Marcus or the world is more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative and clear: discovery of the refuge → meditation period → discovery of the swan → descent to the heart of the library → final acceptance. Causality in this lyric mode holds: the swan prompts burrowing, the stairs lead to deeper archives, and the aphorism about complete self-knowledge reconfigures the premise at closure. The ending offers an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, with her choosing to become part of the archive and “recording nothing, preserving nothing, witnessing everything.” Pressure is more philosophical than situational, so while the pattern is coherent, the lack of any sharp on-page dilemma keeps it from feeling structurally urgent enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single major on-page event (the eclipse session) with a brief, causally motivated denouement after the mother’s arrival. Causality is strong and legible—Mara’s preparation, the eclipse, the adaptive music, and Thomas’s prior mutism all converge in his tentative speech. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act: Mara’s understanding of her work and motherhood subtly but clearly shifts, with cost in the ongoing fragility of both. No orientation issues; time and place are anchored early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Miren in the silo → new box of diaries → discovery of Catherine → link to the tapestry → installation and quiet resolution. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with embedded backstory that’s well anchored and easy to follow. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Miren’s understanding of this fragment—and her own role—deepens via Catherine. The cost is mostly conceptual (a deadened wider world vs. this small act of resistance), but it lands coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: find microdot → constraint (no comms/couriers/abandoning post) → leverage existing fortune-cookie network → embed microdot → off-page transit → on-page light-signal confirmation. Structure is tight and appropriate to the length, with backstory interleaved in ways that illuminate present choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mission succeeds, and we exit on a recalibrated understanding of her maxim about answers in one’s hands. The main limitation is that the operation unfolds without any serious on-page complication or reversal, which slightly flattens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a single, coherent scene: Calloway builds the soundscape, undermines assumptions, and the entity dissolves, with a clear before/after (Marcus possessed vs. freed). Causality under a mostly accumulative/textural lens holds: each added loop and blue mark advances toward the climax. Closure is legible and on the page, though the victory feels slightly too smooth, with little sense that failure is a live possibility. There are no orientation issues; rules are consistent enough not to strain plausibility within this surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—single present scene braided with one coherent seam of backstory—reads cleanly, with strong anchoring of who/where/when in the opening. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each image (spire, ice, horizon, nautilus) layers toward the realization about translation vs prediction. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: “She wasn’t predicting futures anymore…” reweights her past two decades and her craft. The cost is mostly conceptual (time lost, prior hollowness acknowledged) rather than dramatized in a hard choice, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal arc is clear: viaduct → discovery of tablet → vision of her branching timelines → deliberate retracing with opposite choices → reintegration and gravity restored. The non-linear memory-rush is well signposted and returns cleanly to the bridge, so structure remains legible despite temporal compression. Closure is a Decisive Change / Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses gravity and singularity with visible cost. A slight weakness is that the mechanics of how specific “harder” choices collapse infinite branches are summarized rather than shown in one concrete, contested fork.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: discovering the broken needle → experimenting with reversed recordings → discovering “filaments of hush” → transforming teaching and self-understanding. The structure is essentially a single throughline with a few time jumps, all legible and well anchored in the cavern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Oskar’s deafness remains a constraint but is conceptually repriced into the source of a unique artistic practice and meaning. The cost—his permanent loss of hearing and years of numbness—stays visible at the end, even as its value is reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: being followed → tube discovery → coded message → confrontation → revelation about the zones → Marianne’s decision to join the record-keepers. The structure—one continuous courtyard scene with compact backstory—fits the length and maintains orientation effortlessly. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marianne reinterprets her tranquil space as data and commits to mapping the coordinates, accepting a new, heavier role. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (no immediate danger bite), which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a contained visit to the greenhouse, a clear invitation into the annex, the experiment, and a resonant emotional closure. Causality is straightforward—her arrival leads to the UV experiment, which leads to the visible perfume and the decisive grief. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal chain holds without gaps or teleports, and the end offers a clear before/after in her ability to grieve. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reconfigures her loss and her relationship to the vial and to memory with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: find rope → read layers → construct mandala → encounter Sarah → re-commit to walking and witnessing, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Marcus’s role and the rope’s meaning are both reweighted by Sarah’s reveal and his decision to leave the rope as a shrine. Causality under the chosen lens holds: his choices with the rope invite the encounter and the new understanding. Stakes are modest and mostly conceptual, but they cohere and resolve without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous scene whose pressure is built by layering sound, silence, and memory until the “chronic hush” is reweighted at the end. Causality is clean—fires → hush → loss of bonfire tradition → Maya’s alternative ritual—and every step motivates the next. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silence after the final unfinished lullaby and then the single fruit-drop sound redefine the hush as “living quiet,” with the cost of a burned and flooded world still palpably on the page. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and nothing breaks the world’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one scene in the grotto with clear causal flow from sensing the amber → reflecting on her work → revising the blotter. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration when she changes the formula to a more honest half-truth, with a quiet but legible before/after. Stakes remain small-scale and largely internal, yet the throughline with Therese and the dying mother provides enough external frame. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though the “clock” of the mother’s condition stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—wrongly delivered envelope → meeting Chen → shared project → revaluation of “value”—is clean, legible, and fully paid off at the end. The structure (one initial scene plus summarized weeks) fits a Causal/Accumulative hybrid drive and lands in a clear Conceptual Repricing: Marianne’s idea of worth changes. The main weakness is low visible cost; nothing substantial resists or complicates their initiative, so the decisive change feels gentle rather than hard-won. Still, closure is unmistakable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious tags → communal investigation → recognition of weaving patterns → marsh discovery → reveal of authorship → installation and inclusion. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a resonant reconfiguration at the end, and the before/after of Kael’s social position is legible. Closure has emotional cost—she exposes herself and her need to the group—but the search unfolds very smoothly, with minimal real jeopardy or complication. Structure (days of searching culminating in the marsh) is efficient and clear for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, continuous rooftop expedition framed by the giant’s seven-hour nap, with strong orientation and an intelligible causal chain (arrival → time-sculpt → discovery → uncaging → retreat). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she has found and freed the birthplace of echoes and completed her illustration, with the temporal scars and the giant’s stirring as soft costs. The drive lens is predominantly accumulative/textural but supported by coherent causality; the only limitation is that the stakes feel relatively safe and the “price” of her intervention is conceptually interesting but only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: orchard setup → ritual with the eyes → doubled vision → conceptual reconfiguration at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes the goal from solving grief to mapping its terrain, with an on-page cost in relinquishing a more concrete reunion. Causality and scene flow are clear, and the dawn fade provides a neat temporal cadence without feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: outage → mechanical whine → unexplored room → reels → donations → ongoing secret work → culminating moment with the student. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her understanding of “visibility” shifts in a way that clearly reframes everything prior. The drive lens reads accumulative/textural, and the escalation is subtle but coherent as more found items accumulate and their impact grows. The main limitation is the lack of a sharper decisive turn or cost-bearing choice; everything unfolds without real resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene under the trellis framed by richly anchored backstory that always orients from present cues (rain, moss, the leaf). Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven, but the throughline—why control failed and why she chooses a new approach—builds logically toward the closure. The final decision to document plants differently and let the leaf go functions as a resonant reconfiguration of the initial premise. Stakes remain primarily internal and quiet, which keeps escalation modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure (studio + Marcus → night journey → cave realization → return) is clean, with a clear before/after in how she relates to her insomnia and the island. Causality is coherent: she finds the brooch by following trails, Marcus reframes them, she chooses to test that framing, and the cave convergence delivers a Conceptual Repricing of “convergence” and memory. Closure is on the page and legible, with her stance toward insomnia and the island transformed. The main limitation is that the cave sequence resolves briskly with little friction, so escalation feels more like a glide than a tightening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene driven by the pilgrim’s arrival, the malfunctioning pearl, and the revelation of unseen costs, culminating in a clear conceptual repricing. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern shifts in the cave’s music and shadows → failed prophecy → emissary’s reveal → Mara’s stance change. Closure lands on the page with a legible before/after (seer of all futures → willing not-knower) and a conceptual cost. The emissary’s exposition is a bit on-the-nose and conveniently answers everything, slightly flattening the mystery the story otherwise cultivates.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-time scene with interleaved backstory, moving from anticipation to encounter to redefined purpose. Causality is coherent—her long archival work makes the meeting with Thomas and the offer of the boxes both plausible and meaningful. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina’s role shifts from keeper of absence to bridge for the returned, with the archive door opening as a clear before/after image. Stakes stay modestly scaled and the escalation is quiet, which slightly limits structural impact in a high-competition context.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain—mysterious cracks → phantom conductor encounter → validation → descent → fortress → realization → new map—is clean and easy to trace. Closure lands as a conceptual and vocational shift: she commits to mapping a reality that includes unspoken truths, with the fortress itself remaining hidden. The drive lens reads as mainly causal with a light accumulative texture from the recurring motifs. The main limitation is that while cost is implied, no concrete consequence or narrowed future option is dramatized beyond a general warning.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: whales sing → tile activates → ancestral memories surface → she reinterprets her inheritance and assumes a guardian role. The structure is linear and contained to one primary scene, with backstory woven through the activation event without disorienting the reader. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: her life’s frame of meaning shifts, and the cost is the heavy responsibility and abandonment of pure skepticism. The only limit is that the new “mission” is mostly asserted rather than tested on-page, keeping escalation more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: the fragment’s arrival → revelation of Naia’s plan → storm peak as deadline → Naia’s departure → Cassius’s new drive. The closure beat (Naia steps through the gap; Cassius is left with loss and a new, darker goal) lands clearly with cost. A slight weakness is that Cassius never meaningfully attempts to prevent her, so the central decision point is largely unilateral on Naia’s part, reducing some potential friction. Nonetheless, for this scope the arc is tight, legible, and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a tight causal chain: discovery of the ink pot → confrontation → reveal that Mara has already exposed him → offer of treatment, with no dropped threads. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: the father’s grift is effectively ended and his path is narrowed to rehabilitation, at visible personal and relational cost. The use of backstory (estate sale, prior cons, Jacobson’s trust) is minimal and always in service of the present beat. The before/after line is very clear: Mara moves from complicit observer to architect of her father’s potential “resurrection.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative walk through the labyrinth is well-shaped: each zone (lamps, blossoms, roots, final oak) introduces a new inflection of the core time-concept and leads naturally to the center. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: when she reaches the proportionate oak, her decision to persist in false recording reweights everything we’ve seen about truth, time, and history. Stakes remain intellectual rather than situational, but the throughline (escaping the town’s homogenous time by seeking differentiated textures) is clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: death-certificate error → exile to the port → discovery of the poison label → method of collecting stories → revelation about the other Maya Chen → decision to “get myself alive again.” Causality is largely sound under an accumulative/textural lens, with each discovery logically opening the next layer of history. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the meaning of poison, roses, and bureaucratic death is reweighted, and Maya’s stance toward identity is altered with cost. The coincidence of the harbormaster also being a Chen is a bit neat but thematically motivated enough not to break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear causal chain (observatory → bow on strings → hum → conversation fragments → reinterpretation → leaving with shell). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “ephemeral compass” is redefined from magical claim to a structure for understanding connection, with her professional identity implicitly reweighted. Stakes remain coherent and are resolved on the page with her decision to leave the cello and take the shell. The piece avoids dangling set-ups; every introduced element pays off at least thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a present frame of Marina’s work and the encroaching developers, interleaved with concise backstory, leading to her tactical turn (the graffiti) and a charged closing scene. Causality under an accumulative/situational lens holds: gentrification pressure → her decision to reorganize via codes → community shifts → redefined way she greets newcomers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise rather than a decisive victory, with the cost implied in the need for “constant motion” and refusal of solidity. The main limitation is that many developments (community reclaiming platforms, thwarting developers’ boats) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: looming implosion → need for final documentation → chemical timing plan → discovery of the inscription → decision to stage the grain within the shot, all under a clear 90-minute clock. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one continuous scene and reflection that always returns to present action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the photograph, not the mountain, becomes the carrier of history at a real emotional cost. The only limitation is the lack of any substantial on-page complication or misstep once the plan is set, which keeps escalation relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: a malfunctioning drone before launch leads to diagnosis, repair, and a quiet thematic closure with the hummingbird flying true. The single-scene structure is well-contained, with the ship’s departure horn providing a clear temporal spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration around brokenness and perception rather than a decisive change, but it’s legible and earned. The main weakness is that the resolution comes with little real cost or complication, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with embedded reflection that steadily moves from omen (falcon, condensation pattern) to explanation (hydrological maps) to commitment (Mira leaving the outpost). Causality is coherent and legible—falcon data + receding ice + mapped anomalies → conclusion → action—and the closure lands as a Charged Poise moment with her stepping onto ancient ice. However, the cost of that closure is only lightly implied; danger and potential world-reordering remain conceptual rather than sharply dramatized on the page. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with a light accumulative texture, and it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and coherent: arrival → walking/rhythms → townspeople joining → bell restored → collapse averted. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with the patterned walking and tuning gradually reconfiguring the town’s fate. Closure is on the page via the crack sealing and the explicit “collapse that never came,” which reframes the opening line. The main limitation is that the decisive shift comes easily once the pattern is established, with minimal on-page sense that failure was a real option.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is immediate and clean: submersible, beacon, temple, stranded scientist. The causal chain is straightforward and holds: signal → descent → discovery of Chen and vial → temptation vs rescue → ascent and decision about the vial. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Mara chooses to lock the vial away, accepting a cost in knowledge and curiosity. The structure is solid but somewhat conventional; no beat feels wasted, but the arc is predictable once the vial’s danger is explained.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → chapel → lattice → hidden architecture → revelation → choice, with no major logic gaps. The deadline “before they find the bodies” sets a structural frame that is paid off by the sound of boots and the sealing threat. Closure is strong: Matthias decisively chooses to stay and transform, foreclosing his prior life with a clear cost. The structure is conventional but taut and well-contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: inheritance → greenhouse → Eleanora’s revelation → recognition of the bead → planting and release, with no major logic gaps. Closure lands solidly via a decisive act that reconfigures the world (dawn, golden apples), with a clear emotional cost in Eleanora’s centuries of regret and Marcus’ relinquishing of the heirloom. Structure is straightforward and well-contained in a single scene with integrated backstory, appropriate for the length. The main limitation is that complications are minimal—once Eleanora explains the mechanics, success feels inevitable rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—first night, subsequent nights, third week, new moon—builds cleanly toward a clear closure where the map and thread-work align and she departs. Causality within the chosen lyric/accumulative lens is coherent: each night’s walking enables the next day’s sewing and gradually attracts travelers. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the rule and purpose of the labyrinth are reweighted, with a conceptual cost in her relinquishing stewardship. Stakes remain modest and mostly thematic, but there are no structural missteps or orientation debts.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: return → wandering → sundial/steps discovery → excavating the tomb → placing the sundial → decision to stay. Causality is intact and the key setup (grandmother’s letters, sundial) pays off in the pedestal and the inscription at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses to stay and continue the work at clear implied cost to her off-page life, with the sundial shadow as a final hinge image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in a single dilemma, with a clear before/after at the moment she releases the envelope. Causality is straightforward (decoding → verification → hesitation → decision), and the backstory is anchored to present stimuli and choices. Closure works as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid—she forecloses continued disappearance by mailing the letter. Nothing crucial is left dangling or resolved offstage in a way that undercuts the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is clean: months of listening → noticing the flame pattern → decoding the real target → the dawn signal and trucks → the rushed completion and delivery of the embroidery. The piece lands in a clear Charged Poise: history is about to bend, and Mirelle has just barely planted her encoded counter-move, with cost implied in her powerlessness and the thunder of approaching boots. Structure stays within a single, coherent scene framed by the flame and dawn, with backstory tightly integrated. The only ceiling is that the coup itself and its immediate impact remain entirely off-page, slightly muting the sense of a decisive structural beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: a single scene that moves clearly from setup (arrival) through the ritual to a resonant closing image, with no orientation issues. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: the shard, moonlight, condensation, and letters build toward the client reconfiguring her relationship to her regret. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot change the death but alters her stance toward the key moment—at a visible emotional cost. The only limit is that the process feels relatively frictionless once engaged, so the sense of risk or potential failure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: anesthetic rising → noticing the smudged marks → decoding them → inferring the uncle’s hidden evidence → resolving to act, all under a single, coherent lens. Closure lands as a charged poise: she cannot move yet, but the decision and its cost are crystallized in the final image of her hand around the coral. Causality is clean and there are no orientation issues; Mindanao, the hospital-turned-hotel, and recent conflicts are all clearly placed. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the decisive change (physically going to the coordinates) is deferred off-page, so the on-page shift is primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: fragment arrival → reflection and daydream → insight about joy-as-method → new mural → reimagined plan for the square, with closure in the final charged image of the dancer leaping again. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat deepens the central drive (can she recover authentic joy for herself and the community) and culminates in a conceptual repricing of the fog and light. The cost—living with the fog, years of dulled feeling—is present but lightly worn, which lowers impact slightly. Causality is tight with no orientation confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: sound anomalies → discovery of the coin → investigation of the wall → nested mural revelation → decision to keep working. Causality holds throughout, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines her work as a mutual “awakening” rather than a technical task. The cost of her key decision (not reporting, choosing the endless question) is implied more than dramatized, keeping the stakes slightly softer than they could be. Still, for the length, the arc feels complete and purposeful without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with clear orientation and a steady causal thread: audit threat → sanctuary signal → gathering → ritualized beginning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the club formally activates its resistance method, and the last line conceptually reweights their world (“roots sinking deep where no auditor could ever reach”), even if consequences are off-page. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal skeleton with accumulative textural build), and it holds consistently. What keeps this below elite level is the lack of a concrete turn where options narrow or a cost is paid beyond abstract danger; the convergence feels like a beautifully staged continuation more than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from present-night writing to cosmic reflection to dawn recommitment in one continuous, legible window. Causality is soft but consistent—each sensory cue (wind, postcard, world-noise) prompts a deepening of her stance, culminating in the closing decision to “begin again.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts insomnia and longing as her ongoing condition with a clear before/after re-clarification of what that costs and means. The piece is intentionally low on event-level turns, which keeps it from feeling structurally bold enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: present-moment routine → disruption (the cracked note) → reflection anchored to that disruption → choice and reconfigured stasis. Causality is simple but intact; each beat (“she notices,” “she remembers,” “she decides,” “she records”) flows logically and supports the closure. The drive is accumulative/textural, and the ending’s act of hanging the chime and whispering “Thessaly” functions as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a twist. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/emotional, which keeps the piece from feeling maximally pressurized but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: guilt over past silence → creation and use of Varesh ink/script → presented confession → spoken test → reconfigured relationship before departure. Orientation is swift and solid (who/where/when are clear in the opening paragraph), and the single-scene structure fits the scale. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: they are still parting, but with altered terms and a visible emotional cost. The drive lens (causal with relational stakes) holds steadily from start through the charged final image of their joined hands beside the ink well.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: tampered letter → adhesive analysis → realization of competing agendas → on-site discovery of cruel floodgate choice → inventive redesign → political gambit via unsealed report. Structure is cleanly single-scene with light embedded backstory and lands in a Charged Poise closure where options are reconfigured but not yet resolved. The costs (risk to villages, art, and her plan’s political fragility) are legible though not dramatized in direct opposition. Escalation remains mostly conceptual and could benefit from one concrete on-page complication or time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure in the attic with well-motivated flashbacks that are always anchored in present stimuli (dust, meteorite, cylinders). The accumulative drive builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara reframes her history of erasure into a choice to stay, document, and allow a more natural “withering.” Closure lands clearly in the act of placing the meteorite and recommitting to cataloging as an honest paper trail. The only reason it doesn’t go higher is that the narrative turn is gentle rather than sharply dramatized; there’s no major beat where options conspicuously narrow on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure—present terrace scene woven with the father/maze backstory—reads cleanly, with a legible before/after in Mara’s understanding. Causality is metaphysical rather than event-driven, but the internal logic holds: the father’s obsession leads to reality’s fracture, leading to the terrace and Mara’s task. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets both her father’s “necessary distances” and her own role, with the PRESNT code as an on-page pivot. Stakes are modest but coherent, and no orientation or lens ambiguity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: orientation, mystery (feather/city lights), investigation, reveal of the “residents,” and a culminating decision to enter the pattern before the shutdown deadline. Causality holds under a primarily causal lens—her expertise leads to the pattern recognition which leads to the conceptual leap that redefines the city. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: they decide to answer the city, reweighting the facility’s purpose with an implied cost of leaving their prior lives and obligations. The only limitation is that the stakes attached to Kast’s arrival and the shutdown clock stay mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete obstacles or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing gaps → tracking the anomaly to the cave → testing the foam on crater glass → discovering reality’s pruning of paths → leaving with reconfigured understanding. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with embedded backstory that stays anchored in present action, and the conceptual turn is dramatized through the visions, not just explained. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing—her whole life’s work is reweighted—though the practical consequences of that shift remain mostly implied rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene with one reflective shard about her father that directly informs the present choice, and causality holds (orchestrated night → encounter → game → unexpected job offer). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mara, who engineers serendipity, accepts an unengineered opportunity—with a felt before/after in her stance. The “experiential design” job offer borders on convenient coincidence but is thematically seeded by her established skillset, so it reads as situationally plausible rather than contrived. The drive lens is primarily causal with a situational flavor and remains coherent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: idea in meditation → encounter with the moonstone → ingestion → empowered dance → transformed stasis at dawn. The accumulative/lyric structure holds under a textural drive lens, and closure lands as a charged poise/ conceptual repricing of exile and memory. The cost at the end feels more implied than bitten into—her transformation reads as triumphant, with little sense of what she has forfeited beyond what was already in place.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is coherent: arrival → observation → stone throws → conceptual shift → departure. The closure is a clear conceptual repricing of his craft, with the last image (“The work remained the same; the seeing was different”) giving a legible before/after. Causality is mostly experiential rather than event-driven, but it holds under a textural lens. The main limitation is that the “pressure” on his search for meaning never tightens beyond gentle contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clear: walk → reflection on rescue and family → recognition of limits → concrete decision to leave the department and reengage as a father. Backstory is cleanly anchored in the present walk and the porcelain box, so orientation never slips. Closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost (relinquishing his consuming vocation) and a reweighted sense of duty. Escalation is quiet and largely internal, but it coheres under a causal/reflective lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: she’s working on the equation, the timelines synchronize, the gauge’s function reconfigures, and the timelines collapse into a new woven unity. Causality holds within the speculative premise, and the shift from preventing divergence to measuring its beauty forms a coherent conceptual turn. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: her understanding of the accident and of hope itself is reweighted, with the gauge and patterns as focal tools. The cost—abandoning the fantasy of prevention for a more complex acceptance—is present but could be sharpened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the ivy-veiled passage, discovery in the library, proof via diaries/negative, and a return to the passage with a reweighted understanding. Causality is intact—her search leads to the fireplace, the fireplace to the diaries, the diaries to the negative, the negative to her realization. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the rules of the world (walls dreaming forward, ivy as nervous system) are reframed and her mission redefined, with the emotional cost of inheriting an isolating obsession. Stakes remain internal and quiet but coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear task, ticking clock (the bells), and a resonant closing image. Causality is straightforward—she is commissioned, executes a method, and we see the first signs of its spread via children singing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: mirrors and reflection are redefined, and her sister’s death is reframed as a gift she now extends to the city. The main limitation is that the path from commission to success feels largely unchallenged, reducing structural tension even as the arc itself is tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense ritual on the terrace framed by brief backstory and a compressed three-day negotiation, culminating in a clear reconfiguration of what “peace” and “redemption” mean. Causality is legible—ritual → emotional softening → imperfect treaty—and the ending image (clipboard waiting) lands as a resonant stasis with cost. The time-compression of the three days is efficient rather than evasive. A slightly more concrete on-page turning point in the talks themselves could elevate the sense of structural inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with interleaved backstory, all driving causally toward the choice to drop the egg and the onset of rain. His engineered drought creates the crack-map, which draws him here with the fossil, and the rain that follows his renunciation reconfigures both his empire and the land. The closure unit is strong—a decisive change plus conceptual repricing of his life’s work—with a clear before/after and visible cost. The faint suggestion of cosmic symmetry in the timing of the rain is poetic rather than a causality break, so it supports rather than undercuts the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory, building causally from approach → recognition of the web → dangerous untangling → shattering release. The drive lens is primarily causal, with each step logically following her discovery of the voices and the sanctuary’s true function. Closure is solid: the web is destroyed on-page, the voices are freed, and the arrival of guards signals real-world consequences. The main limitation is that the resolution feels almost too smooth—no failed attempt or serious setback before success—though this doesn’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure in the radar dome with interleaved backstory, and the causal link from argument → reflection → experiment → new decision is coherent. The closure—a conceptual and practical commitment to “reverse everything” about his storytelling—is explicit and clearly grounded in the preceding work with the puppets. Drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal arc with accumulative reflection), but remains stable to the end. Stakes stay internal and modestly scaled, yet the decisive change in his artistic ethics is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: build → first monarch → gathering swarm → final stance, all in a single, continuous scene. Causality is straightforward and stakes consistently reframed through each new detail of extinction and ritualized witnessing. Closure works as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Mira recommits to building transient memorials, with the cost of inevitable loss and impermanence clearly felt. There are no orientation issues or broken set-ups, though the structural turn is more deepening than surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the sanctum post-forgiveness → ritual preparation → the rope’s activation → casting → hanging the bells, all in one coherent scene. Causality is strong under an accumulative/ritual lens: each step (rebraiding, inserting the card, humming) leads naturally to the next. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as Mira leaves the sanctum with the bells installed, cost implicit in her walking away from the newly revoiced dead. There are no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: decaying directive → forest journey → bunker archive → dream immersion → conceptual shift, all under the pressure of the approaching storm. Causality is soft but present (directive leads her here; dreams lead to understanding; she responds by adding her own). Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: destiny reframed as conversation, with a legible before/after in how she relates to time and choice. Stakes remain primarily intellectual and spiritual, which limits the felt cost despite the clean architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: tile discovery → decoding magic square → twilight shadows reveal new data → desert journey → buried treatise. The two-shard structure (palace then desert three days later) is straightforward and escalates toward a clear closure image, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she crosses from seeker to inheritor of a four-thousand-year knowledge lineage at real financial and emotional cost. Some turns (the ground resonating, the exact four-thousand-year recurrence) lean on convenient pseudo-mysticism, but they don’t break the causal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: accusation → evidence via cellular memory → re-interpretation of the brother’s choice → Kale’s decision to release resentment. The Sanctuary rules are legible early, so the later reality/memory shifts feel like consequences of established capacities, not late rule changes. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when Kale restores the missing pin and asks to be taught, with a clear before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that the cost of this change is more asserted than felt; the difficulty of relinquishing hatred is under-dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: lost brother → sextant returns → Aria uses mirror craft to reconstruct the past and boundary → brother crosses back. The single-scene structure holds tight focus, with one meaningful tightening as the ritual deepens and the fog responds. Closure is strong: the brother’s altered state and the reconfigured behavior of the fog mark a clear before/after with emotional and conceptual cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the hybrid of causal and textural escalation is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: corporate choice → fallout → estrangement → Lena’s letter → cathedral meeting → recommitment to the old craft. Closure lands directly on the page with a decisive change (resumed teaching and mutual commitment to a new, contract-free practice) and visible cost already established (lost workshop, years of distance). The single continuous scene is well-contained and oriented, with backstory woven in through clear anchors (letter, bag, grinding stone). The main weakness is that the central obstacle yields without much resistance once they begin talking.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → disorientation → reflective pattern (bath) → interpretive breakthrough → quest to the central tree → charged acceptance. Causality holds under a textural/insight lens, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she chooses to tend the orchard and inscribe her own truth. The stakes are largely conceptual (what it means to live between “first and last page”), but they do shift her options and identity in a legible before/after. A slightly clearer sense of material or relational cost would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—diary → descent via catalog gaps → discovery of the readers → negotiation with the bookstore → release—is clean, legible, and well-contained within one continuous drive. Closure is solid: the bookstore’s shift from consumption to exchange is a clear Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing. The structure leans a bit on summary (e.g., “She’d spent weeks researching”), which slightly blunts on-page immediacy but doesn’t break orientation or logic. The resolution feels slightly quick and low-resistance given the eerie build-up, which keeps this out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: card → ship as liminal refuge → funhouse mirrors → realization of the garden-as-process → choosing a narrative thread. Causality within the lyric mode holds, and the closure is a strong conceptual repricing where “truth” becomes a chosen story with visible implications. The decisive act—selecting a particular history—reconfigures the premise with some cost, though the stakes remain more metaphysical than viscerally dramatized. Orientation is solid early on; the pattern of nonlinearity is taught and paid off without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one focused night scene with a clear line from door → rope deciphering → reconfiguration → conceptual resolution. Causality is coherent even given the fantastical premise: the seal-as-map leads to rebraiding, which triggers the building’s temporal reconfiguration and explains the impossible door. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR, but the sense of price is mild—time passes, reality shifts, but there’s little bite to the cost. The drive lens feels largely accumulative/textural with some causal backbone, and it holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: unbearable sonic pressure → descent into caves → use of maps/ice-reading → discovery and activation of the echo stone → partial relief for the village. Orientation (who/where/why) is established early and never lost, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the problem isn’t solved but reweighted into something bearable, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the path is smooth and somewhat foregone, with few genuine doubts or setbacks once he reaches the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: broken prism → retrocognitive insight → realization it’s a map → decision to undertake a quest. Causality holds throughout, and the transition from pavilion to impending journey is smooth. Closure is a Charged Poise moment: she commits to the quest with a reweighted understanding of coincidence and the beacon. The main limitation is that the story stops at commitment rather than testing the plan, keeping the arc slightly preliminary.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: arrival → methodical examination of shadows → discovery of impossible angles → recognition of recursion and self-awareness → choice to merge, all in one coherent scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each observation reweighting the situation rather than introducing arbitrary new rules. Closure lands clearly as a conceptual repricing: the archive is no longer a passive storehouse but an active subject, and Elden’s status shifts from observer to component with evident loss of self. The cost is legible on the page (the dropped quill, the absorption), even if emotional beat-work at that moment could be one notch fuller.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: mosaic note → journey → invitation at gate → test with rag knot → communal lantern lighting → internal reconfiguration. The piece reads under a largely causal lens with an accumulative textural layer; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where Kael reprices his failure and craft. Cost (carrying the accident into a new practice, weeping/laughing as he re-engages danger) is materially on the page. Escalation is modest and internal, so the structure feels complete but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is simple but solid: a live argument, an attempted deflection via the cicada, a deepening into the mother’s illness and Chen’s work, then a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality holds—each move grows from the prior: Mira’s anger, his reveal of the cicada, her softening, his confession, her request for stories. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: they have not “resolved” the abandonment, but the request to hear about the mother marks a before/after with emotional cost. It’s not structurally daring, but it’s clean, legible, and appropriately scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: the gravity inversion at dawn triggers immediate physical stakes, which then braid with backstory and culminate in a clear stance-taking at the end. Causality is coherent (inversion → lost bottles → chase for doll → shattering of mother-silence vessel → revaluation → choice of sky), and the hour-long inversion provides a contained frame. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: Mira forecloses a return to the bunkers by choosing to remain in the xenial trellis with cost implicit in abandoning her mother’s survival doctrine. The piece reads as a situational/accumulative hybrid with the lens held consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally sound: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and a legible before/after in Elena’s relationship to silence. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: the ritualized quiet, storm glass, and guided attention together lead to her reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to return next year, signaling a new stance toward grief—though the price of that choice remains mostly implied. Stakes stay modest, but for this scope they’re adequately articulated and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mural → orchard → ruby flake → revelation → throne room → stair activation, with no obvious logic breaks. Structure fits a two-shard pattern (discovery then return/activation) and closure lands via a decisive change plus conceptual repricing of “ascension.” The sunrise deadline is underutilized as active pressure, surfacing mostly as framing rather than a constraint that changes tactics. Still, the before/after—ignorant cataloger vs. initiated lore keeper descending into the archive—is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, focused encounter framed by the threshold’s behavior: Mara anticipates a visitor, the girl arrives, they redefine what crossing means, and the threshold seals. Under a situational/accumulative lens, the pressure coheres around whether the girl will relinquish her old patterns enough to enter this space, with the silent ring and vanishing threshold providing a concrete pivot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the girl has already crossed and accepts apprenticeship in “burning carefully,” with the sanctuary now protecting rather than merely witnessing. The causal chain is tidy and legible, though largely talk-driven rather than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: glitchy texts → decision to volunteer → following the mushrooms → locating the breach → installing the bolt → emergence of the quantum diamonds and chorus of gratitude, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as both a decisive act (sealing the breach) and a conceptual repricing of “pressure,” with some cost carried forward from her past. The main structural weakness is the lack of any serious complication once she accepts the mission—no real setbacks or risks threaten failure, so escalation feels more like a smooth ritual than pressured problem-solving. Still, for a short, single-scene piece, the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Cassian’s arrival → gramophone discovery → encoded confession → re-evaluation of prior justice → decision to act. Causality is solid under a Causal lens; each step logically follows from the last without teleporting props or retroactive fixes. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the dynasty is revealed as poisoned from inception, and Cassian’s mission shifts from “ending” to ensuring fully-informed reparations. The cost is legible—renewed responsibility and burden—though the scene’s conflict is quiet and largely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: inciting incident (the impossible program), progressive transformations of the setting, then a ritual climax and conceptual re-seeing of the greenhouse. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each shift (trees forming a stage, strings descending) tightens pressure toward his choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes the strings and oath, with a legible before/after in his stance. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than concrete, but it’s present.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense scene punctuated by historical documents, all causally linked by the discovery of the misfiled folder. The piece operates on an accumulative lens, with each new document reweighting the emotional and ethical stakes. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—Miriam cannot change the past but chooses to alter how it is remembered, with a clear before/after in her task. The causal chain never breaks, and orientation (who/where/when) is solid early on.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece is cleanly structured around a single evening’s operation at the lagoon, with backstory integrated via present cues (the tide, the key, the photographs). Causality is solid: safehouse raid → lagoon mission → discovery → searchlight → forced retreat into vault, producing a Charged Poise closure where future options are reconfigured. Stakes and world rules (erased maps, coded puddle reflections, unmonitored tech) hold together without contradiction. The only thing holding this back from a higher band is that the final turn is more a quiet continuation than a sharp, felt before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: letter → grotto → performance as working-through → felt resolution, all in one continuous scene with no orientation debt. Causality is legible under an accumulative/lyric lens: his negative-space playing because of the letter therefore alters the status of the prophecy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—prophecy “put to sleep,” Marcus leaving lighter—with a clear before/after. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (family “ruin” never concretized), which softens the sense of cost despite good structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: strange leaves → systematic observation → moonstone speck → revelatory message → transformation and new practice. Causality holds (her prodding the speck triggers the leaf-sequence and her change), and the final reconfiguration—Miren as living conduit of remembrance—lands cleanly. Some middle material is summarized (“As months passed… other sorters came”) rather than dramatized, slightly diluting immediacy. Nonetheless, closure reads as a coherent Conceptual Repricing with a decisive internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean and legible: workshop → arrival of compass → investigation via needle → discovery of admiral’s chamber → conceptual reorientation. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens, with the compass and the pattern of mailed artifacts motivating each next step. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus reconceives the purpose of broken instruments and his own work, and the last image of the freely spinning compass crystallizes that. The only limitation is that some key shifts (three days of study, the full pattern of clocks) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: failed search → discovery of coin → alchemical working → presentation to magistrate → emotional repricing of “missing.” The piece adheres to a single POV, two-scene structure with one transition and no orientation issues. Closure lands solidly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the magistrate’s shift from suspended hope to memorializing acceptance is embodied in the coin and candle, with clear emotional cost. The drive lens (causal with thematic emphasis) holds consistently from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: descent → encounter → confession intensifies → Kael’s methodological turn to laughter → release and quiet coda. Causality is solid under a mostly causal lens; each move follows logically from Kael’s choices and the gorge’s properties. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the soul is not just removed but healed, and Kael’s path of “pursuing the next luminous ache” feels like an earned continuation. Stakes are modest but appropriate for the length and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single present-time line (forest → clearing → encounter → decision) framed by concise backstory that clearly informs current stakes. Causality holds—her being dumped post-interrogation explains both the enhancements and the setting, and the old man’s explanation clicks logically with what we’ve seen. Closure is a genuine turn: Sera moves from defensive, pain-primed vigilance to choosing a new mode of life and learning, with the mask-laying as a decisive marker. The stakes remain intimate but coherent under an accumulative/causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: market → acquisition of the lens → revelation in the studio → public exhibition, each step deepening the central drive. Causality is tight under the textural lens: because she needs an “anchor,” she seeks the fragment; because of the fragment, the hidden portraits emerge; because of those, the exhibition reconfigures the city’s memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing in the final image of the girl and grandmother and the light anchoring forgotten names. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, but it is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: dead lights → ghost appears → he investigates ceiling → discovers box → understands Celeste → commits to returning the mechanism, which releases the ghost. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and smoothly, and the piece holds a single coherent scene with no temporal confusion. Closure functions as a quiet resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with a new obligation and a slightly reweighted sense of his work’s purpose. The cost is subtle—taking on an open-ended errand rather than resolving a dire problem—so the ending lands more softly than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: operator arrives → frost patterns appear → bottled whisper exposes Marina’s prior choice → press translates frost into a map → library breaks the loop. Closure is strong: the library shifts from looping fall to genuine motion, and Marina moves from preserving sameness to opening a book in a destabilized world. The cost—loss of the “perfect equilibrium” she curated—is on the page and felt even within the concise scene. The drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds consistently, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses a single continuous scene with reflection interleaved, and the causal chain (enter chamber → study shard → recall past → devise counter-argument → reprice civilization/revolution) is clear. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing of what revolution and civilization mean. Closure is solid: by the end, Kasimir has a new stance on both the asteroid builders and his own work, with a felt emotional cost. Stakes remain intellectual/emotional rather than situationally urgent, which keeps the structural ambition modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: descent → examination → discovery of the stone → strategy based on resonance → ritual repair → restored balance. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change with the curse undone and the world fractionally mended—though the cost of success is quite light. The structure is a single, well-contained scene with no orientation issues and an elegant return to the chamber in the final image. The absence of a meaningful setback or complication keeps it below top-tier in terms of structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: the mysterious compass arrival motivates the descent, which culminates at the lagoon in a threshold choice to dive. The inferred drive lens is largely accumulative/textural—each layer (factory closure, psychometry glimpse, lagoon’s properties) reweights the final act—yet causal links remain legible. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: she crosses into the water and dives, with the compass stilling on shore as conceptual punctuation. The cost and “before/after” are clear but more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: storm → archway → slide → realization → new project/return, with each step naturally following the last. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her artistic philosophy and navigation methods, with the GPS reappearance functioning as a clear before/after marker. Stakes remain modest and interior, but they’re coherent and resolved on the page. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though escalation is more contemplative than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: long-term block → pavilion visits → conversation → grandmother’s postcard → reframed understanding and concrete decision of what to paint. Structure is tight within a single scene, with backstory well-anchored to present stimuli. Closure arrives as a clear conceptual repricing—“night” as proper illumination—and a resolved artistic direction, though the cost of that shift is more implied than dramatized. The lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: encrypted diary → coordinates → descent → encounter → bargain → covenant. The piece maintains a single clear drive and lands in a charged final configuration (one leaves as messenger, one stays as keeper) with legible cost. Structure is straightforward but appropriate; there are no orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → discovery of the bottle → conceptual work → communal revival, with the bottle reframed from puzzle to mirror at closure. Causality is coherent (her method of mental reconstruction and refusal to pour out the liquid leads to a new kind of rebuilding), and orientation is strong from the opening. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the town’s rebirth via human effort reweights the premise of wish-magic. The main limitation is that no beat significantly narrows options or heightens concrete jeopardy; the pressure arc stays low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The two-shard structure (third-grade visit → adult return) is clean, causally linked, and easy to follow, with the prophecy credibly driving Marcus’s life and return. The foghorn’s silence acts as a structural hinge in both halves, and the ledger handoff provides a solid closure unit—a conceptual repricing of what an archive is. The cost (accepting a life-defining, quasi-sacred responsibility) is legible though understated. Escalation is more conceptual than dramatic but coherent under a hybrid causal/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: seeds are dying → entropy is wrong in the atrium → solution requires spending vortex inheritance → she chooses to step in and re-open the space. The structure is a single, coherent scene with integrated backstory that all points toward the central act of entering the spiral. Closure is strong: the atrium is reopened, the entropy imbalance corrected, and the future reconfigured with a clear before/after. The cost of using up the grandmother’s unused years is conceptually present but could be more sharply underlined in the ending image to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: zero hour for the new system → rope detects what instruments miss → Mara overrides automation → storm vindicates her choice. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the single-scene structure holds a clear before/after around the manual switch. Closure lands via a concrete test and outcome—cracked buttresses, valley saved, looming conflict with the board—so cost is visible even if some consequences are deferred. The only ceiling is that the off-page board conflict, while set up, remains somewhat abstract at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: a single continuous scene of cleaning and watching, interleaved with reflection, builds toward a quiet but legible reconfiguration (this is not exile but arrival). Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens: meteors → contemplation → reframing of surrender as strength. Closure lands in the final beat with the charged image of her setting down the mop to watch the “universe fall upward into light,” which crystallizes the prior meditation with conceptual cost. The main limitation is how little on-page change occurs in the present moment—most stakes and losses are off-stage history, summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: we move from the empty hives to discovery, to confrontation at the tree, to release and a new role for Mara, with no orientation issues. Causality is coherent under an accumulative lens—her long observation of ghosts informs the decision to open the box, the letter’s content reweights the covenant, and reading it aloud allows the ghosts to dissipate. Closure is strong: Mara’s function in the oasis decisively reconfigures from beekeeper-surrogate to keeper of unspoken truths, with a visible new pattern of action implied. The cost remains mostly conceptual (breaking a sacred covenant and accepting ongoing solitude), which fits the piece but could be shaded more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece structures cleanly: present-day frame → visitor/shard → coded listing → midnight gathering, all coherently linked. The inferred drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing of time’s loss and tradeoff. Causality is intact (the listing brings visitors; the shard anchors the gathering), but pressure remains low and the final beat crystallizes rather than turns the situation. The cost of Mira’s work (social risk, inner conflict) is mentioned rather than dramatized in a concrete decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: rain → kite struggle → string snap → drake/feather → boy’s arrival → shared storytelling → gift and reflection. The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric drive but still delivers a clear closure beat via Maren’s reframed understanding and the gifting of the feather. Stakes and costs are scaled appropriately for a quiet story and there’s no orientation debt. The only minor limitation is that the final reflective paragraph slightly over-explains what the prior events have already dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear and satisfying: prognosis → diary discovery → reinterpretation of the temple → systematic remodeling → transformed orchard → death under a reconfigured order. The structure is linear with one quiet but effective deepening when she begins to act on the architect’s secrets, and the closure (her final diary entry and death within the humming system she’s completed) lands cleanly with cost. Some middle work is summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat, which slightly flattens the sense of progressive constraint, but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by her ascent, present-tense interaction with Quorum, and a thematically charged closing image. Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven—her repeated prior walks and present conversation build to the decision to share the pilgrimage. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward her own experiment has altered, and the alien’s future participation tightens the premise. Stakes remain modest and internal, but they are coherent and carried through without dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → recollection of the reef and war → consultation with the birds → targeted planting → quiet departure, with the closure beat being the seeds beginning “their work of reclamation.” Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each step grows out of the previous one without gaps, and orientation (who/where/when) is precise from the opening. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but it clearly marks a before/after in the site’s meaning. The only limit is that the narrative arc feels more like a beautifully rendered ritual than a pressured change in options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: Mercy’s scent → discovery of bunker → cylinder revelation → Calder’s decoding → settlement mobilization → departure. Closure is solid as a Decisive Change from isolation to collective action, with an implied cost in the arduous journeys to come. The ease of Calder’s overnight decoding and the lack of any obstructive force keep the structure from feeling fully pressured or hard-won. Still, the piece tracks cleanly and lands its intended turn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment observation interleaved with tightly anchored backstory, leading to a conceptual closure around “true north” and her chosen stasis. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with the shutdown, her immunity, and the anniversaries naturally building to the final sketching moment. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration (how she frames exile as transformation), and the constraint of being unable to leave is explicit. What’s missing is a clearer on-page shift or tightening in the present scene; the piece reads more like an extended state portrait than a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: climb → confrontation with guardian → revelation of the sundial lid/coordinates → resolved stance as he descends. Causality holds throughout—the wrong sky and past theft motivate the ascent; his new secret-trading practice motivates the guardian’s forgiveness and gift. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines his role from hoarder to distributor of wonder and accepts the world’s “wrongness” as expansion. The main limitation is the relatively low felt cost; nothing crucial is risked or lost on the page to make his shift precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense walks in the gallery frame backstory and conceptual lenses (“nomadic penumbra”), building toward the partnership with the archivist. Causality is soft but coherent: her disbelieved testimony leads to her private historiography, which then meets the official archive. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the history of the crisis is redefined around “ordinary courage,” with a new archival practice as the turning point. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible in her relinquishing sole ownership of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: stone discovery → vision trigger → reinterpretation of the “lost language” → the physical act of embedding the stone → transformed labyrinth and self. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost (pain, surrender of hiding) and an earned new stasis in the final image. The accumulative/lyric progression holds under a consistent lens, and there are no orientation or logic breaks. The one limitation is that external stakes remain small and mostly symbolic, keeping escalation firmly on the interior plane.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal line is clean: Petrov studies the tapestry → decodes the message → understands the nature of the labyrinth and the freeze → reinterprets his exile and chooses a different stance. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is established early and never wavers, and the time-resume beat is well placed as a structural hinge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis, with his decision not to descend functioning as a real, if understated, decisive change. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain conceptual rather than felt as active peril or deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: the crime/backstory is revealed, the new “refracted” ritual emerges, the elder confronts her, and the ending lands in a charged poise around the upcoming climb. Causality holds—her sessions draw others, which draws the elder, which reframes the official ritual. Closure comes via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, which fits the accumulative/textural lens but slightly softens impact. All key set-ups (ritual, spire, echoes) are paid off, though the final decision about the ritual remains deliberately unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: attempt to match pockmarks → repeated failures → alignment → activation → near-drowning and revelation → renewed, clarified commitment. The single continuous scene with one temporal break (surfacing) supports a clear before/after in knowledge and stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the problem’s scale and method (slow, mapped, generational) are redefined with visible cost and constraint. A slight compression of how much reflection happens “between breaths” is the only minor plausibility strain.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean: mirror crack → resurfaced promise → diverted path → cave discovery → shell project → redistribution and new stance on art. Structure is linear and coherent, with one continuous present-day arc supported by brief but relevant backstory. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration: she redefines what “mattering” and “intimacy” in art mean, marked by leaving the easel behind. The cost is emotional and vocational rather than dramatic, but it reads on the page and gives a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight and legible: the heat wave’s end enables the plan, preparation occupies the day, and the midnight test with the fishing vessel leads to on-page reconfiguration in Thomas’s stance. Causality is clean under a mainly causal lens, and the closure (“the lighthouse pulsed on… Come home. We’re here”) reads as an earned stasis/reconfiguration. The one soft spot is that Mira’s risky experiment works flawlessly on the first try, so the sense of jeopardy at the climax is somewhat muted. Still, the before/after of how the lighthouse is used feels clear and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single night-into-dawn sequence where building the device causally leads to a reinterpretation of the reverse migration and a new stance. Backstory shards (brother, mother leaving) are well-anchored and feed directly into present stakes without derailing momentum. The closure—her reframing of the migration as temporal and her commitment to future navigators—reads as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The plot remains inward and contemplative, so the “risk” of her new purpose isn’t deeply tested, but the arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: find relic → Henrik’s plea reframes its value → decision to test it in the orchard → observed community effect → Mira’s conceptual shift and the relic’s enshrinement. Structure is clear, with one clean transition from discovery/market to communal use, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “rationality.” Some middle material is told in overview (the influx of people, their attempts) rather than in a sharpened scene, which modestly blunts escalation but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time investigation → anomalies → key → recalled story → coordinates → decision, with clear causal steps. The closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis moment: Magnus commits to diving at low tide and to carrying forward someone else’s story. Stakes remain mostly epistemic and conceptual, with the physical risk of tomorrow’s search gestured to rather than tested on the page. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, but the decisive change is modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: closing the shop → following the half-remembered promise → ants → wall → chip → visions → altered stance. The piece lands solid closure via a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he reconceives the “doorway of decisions” and commits to choosing differently, with the cost of lost years implicitly felt. Structure is tight and single-scene with one graceful backstory insertion (grandmother’s instructions) anchored in present action. There are no major unkept setups or causality breaks, and the ending feels like a true “after” to the “before.”

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine (ignored warning → climb → encounter with grotto → self-confrontation → descent) is clean and self-contained for this length, with no orientation issues. The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive, but cause-and-effect still hold at each turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to the same world with newly reweighted self-knowledge and a figurative “wound” that will change future choices. Stakes remain internal, yet the cost is legible enough that the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean from the first paragraph: who, where, when, and what she’s doing are immediately legible. The structure is a single accumulating scene where Mira’s question prompts Solène to articulate and demonstrate her real project, culminating in giving Mira a sphere and recommitting to returning to the Academy changed. Closure lands as a quiet conceptual repricing: light redefined as testimony with an implied social cost (heresy, institutional conflict). However, the story lacks a strong on-page turn; Solène’s stance doesn’t substantially change during the scene so much as get voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is essentially accumulative: present-frame handling of the scroll interwoven with backstory and dream summaries, closing on a reweighted understanding of memory and narrative. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what’s wrong with her), and the Hillcrest grave plus diagnosis plus dreams cohere into a single pressure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the scrolls outlasting her confusion and memory understood as alterable story, which validates her choice to keep writing. The piece is reflective rather than event-heavy, but within that mode the causality and build feel tight.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: a single scene with a short reflective passage, all anchored clearly in time, place, and POV by the first paragraph. Causality is modest but coherent (broken clock → examination → discovery of crack → reframing as emotional, not supernatural, crisis). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elena’s decision to delay repair and repurpose the screw reweights the narrative from “haunted clock” to intergenerational agency, with a legible cost in leaving the practical problem unresolved. Escalation is more interpretive than event-driven, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: stress → crystallization → turn to superstition → regained hands → Shedding Runes → reinterpreted scars → altered relationship to fear. The single-scene ritual frame keeps orientation and stakes focused, with the storm bookending the piece as a temporal and atmospheric container. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves as “a living text,” with fear reweighted rather than erased. The one mild softness is that each step works on first attempt, so there’s little structural complication once the method is chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Margot arrives under a time limit, provokes the haunting, escalates it, then alters tactics with confession and a revised article, leading to Vivienne’s rest and the charged orchard ending. Backstory is interleaved efficiently and always tilts the present stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Margot cannot save the orchard or undo harm, but she changes what persists (Vivienne’s story and her own path) with a visible emotional cost. All major set-ups (article, affair, archive, orchard deadline, induced currents) pay off without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → exploration → spiral chamber → Hiccup → altered state, with each movement logically building toward the conceptual repricing at the end. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, and the closure—Kael becoming part of the spiral and revaluing illusion vs truth—is legible and on-page. The “Great Hiccup” functions as a clear fulcrum beat anchoring the climax. The main limitation is that pressure and options do not narrow in a sharply dramatized way; the path feels almost preordained rather than urgently chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: whistle → anomaly between clocks → decision to test → countdown experiment → altered horizon → new understanding and a charged return to stasis. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: clocks as negotiation with time rather than measurement, with a concrete price (blood, missing seconds, burden of knowledge). The single-scene structure is tight and focused, with no wandering subplots or unkept setups. Stakes stay mostly conceptual rather than situationally dire, which slightly softens the felt cost despite the elegant architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where each conversational and observational beat leads to the next (mushroom pattern → network mapping → button → letting-go insight). The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the closure (deleting the number) lands as a decisive change with emotional cost. There are no causality breaks or loose set-ups, and the return to “before the echo of morning birdsong” neatly brackets the arc. Escalation is subtle but traceable, appropriate for the quiet, interior focus.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: present-time library frame, backstory braided in, then a concrete interpretive breakthrough leading to a decision to go to the hospital. The causal line from subway scrawls → research → koan → hidden message → reframed stance holds under a situational/accumulative lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices what it means to love her father and act “responsibly,” with a clear before/after. Escalation is mostly internal and modest, but it never loses orientation or muddles the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: her reassignment → protocol of estrangement → earlier breach with the caller → his return call that tests her allegiance to the system → her further breach by offering concrete advice. The structure is a single present-tense scene with a prior off-page encounter folded in, and the closure (her redefined attitude toward “wrong numbers”) is legible and motivated. Cost is implied rather than dramatized—risking termination, undermining the city’s psychic “infrastructure”—but it’s clear enough to charge the ending. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a resonant conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: jetty frame, backstory integrated, arrival of returnees, then conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens—the archives and covenant lead to the return, and the locket’s inscription bridges leaving and returning. Closure is solid via a resonant reconfiguration: Maren’s understanding of her role, and the town’s leaving, is reweighted with emotional and conceptual cost (her years of solitude). The main weakness is that the explanation of the covenant’s true nature leans on expository dialogue rather than dramatized discovery, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: moon rock arrival → Emil’s revelation that there are seventeen → gathering at the station → collective realization and new arrangement. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens: the rumor chains and coordinates bring them together; their combining of fragments precipitates the reframing of their lives. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the rocks as “permission” and the station as “anchor point”—with a clear before/after in how they move through the world. Escalation is a bit soft, with few concrete obstacles or hard choices beyond the internal frame shift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single lyrical approach toward a goal (the stillpoint) with one main escalation (hearing the foreign note/melody) leading to conceptual closure. Causality and accumulative pressure hold: rods pull → notes emerge → recognition of the sister’s tune → conceptual repricing of grief. Closure is solidly on the page with a before/after in how Sera understands her inner landscape, and the mentor’s ring pays off without feeling contrived. The piece chooses an accumulative/textural drive and sustains it coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal/accumulative line: routine signal → anomalous coordinates → archival check → reality edits → conceptual leap → decision to write. Orientation is clear early (Mara, Kepler Station, the anomaly), and the anomaly’s “pulse” acts as a hinge into the altered-records section. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mara reconceives the station as a bookmark between drafts of reality and chooses a new role. The cost of that choice remains largely abstract, but the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: the long, preparatory project with the harbor maps leads to Theo’s program, which leads to the public disruption and Marina’s revaluation of what it means to “exist.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she hasn’t escaped erasure, but her stance toward it has changed with a clear cost (accepting ephemerality over the fantasy of permanent capture). The scene stays in one continuous frame with a tight throughline from first click of the empty camera to the last. Stakes and outcomes are modest but coherent, with no obvious causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—art thefts → hidden trail → Tethyan archive → documentation → decision to re-emerge—is clean and legible, with a clear before/after once she has proof and chooses to face judgment. The piece uses an accumulative structure: present exploration framed by compressed backstory, culminating in a reweighted understanding of her crimes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she returns with evidence and a redefined sense of her “arson” as love), with clear conceptual cost. Escalation is modest and mostly intellectual/emotional; adding one sharper on-page obstacle or present-tense risk could strengthen structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the garden that moves from disorientation to a crystallized decision to embrace the neural merge. Causality within the accumulative/lyric frame holds: conversation → environmental discord → reorientation at the railing → joint drumming and a reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration when they literally and figuratively join hands in a new shared “song,” though the felt sense of irreversible cost could be pressed harder. Orientation and stakes are clear throughout, with no major lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: storm → reconfiguration → coin/challenge → entering the maze → sound/keyhole solution → invitation to inner circle. Orientation is strong from the outset; there’s no confusion about who, where, or when. Closure arrives via a clear conceptual shift (reframing the labyrinth’s purpose and Marcus’s role), but the “hunting someone” hook doesn’t quite resolve as a pressured pursuit, undercutting the feeling of payoff. The cost of the outcome—what he’s giving up or risking—is only lightly suggested.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the guild’s plan → need for a safe way to expose it → nonverbal collaboration with the guardian → shutter-constellation message that will reach the city. The single-scene structure is tight and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: Marina leaves with a plan enacted and the cost (ongoing risk, unresolved political fight) still live. Slight hand-waving around “impossible to ignore” and the mechanism of citywide dissemination softens the felt logistical stakes. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a tight single-scene conversation that progresses logically from “you’re quitting” to the revelation of the grotto to the invitation. Under a situational/accumulative lens, the pressure coheres around Danny’s choice of stance toward conformity, with the window-display plan as a concrete tactic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Miss Chen reframes rebellion and Danny tentatively chooses alignment by agreeing to stay in chess club and being invited to the grotto. The cost—potential conflict with his father and town norms—is legible though not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single escalating scene: discovery of the scrimshaw → revelation of the island → whale call → invitation → decision. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/situational lens, with the map and whale song prompting a stance crystallization rather than a plot twist. Closure lands on the decision “We detach together,” a clear before/after, though the consequences are mostly implied rather than dramatized. There are no orientation issues or broken setups, but the Treaty/“violence impossible” worldbuilding doesn’t feed back into the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clear before (performative narration), middle tightening (Emma referencing the funeral), and after (abandoning the script). Causality is clean—his ongoing performance leads directly to the conversation that breaks it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush is broken and a new mode of being becomes possible, with cost on the page. The stakes are intimate rather than large-scale, but fully coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: ban lifts → Meris returns → she reactivates the colonnade and recommits, with other poets arriving as a closing beat. As an accumulative/textural design, it escalates via intensifying humming, deepening explanation of the ban, and the final stance against future repression. Closure lands as a charged poise/quiet conceptual repricing: the world’s meaning-rules have shifted back, and that cannot be undone. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized danger, which keeps it below the very top band but still coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: phoenix → courtyard drowsiness → plant trail → Tomás’s half-sleep → the barter → the awakening painting, with closure as the courtyard stirs. Structure is tight for the length, staying in one main scene with brief but clear context. The main weakness is the low felt cost: the trade for the reed is easy, there’s no serious risk the painting won’t work, and awakening spreads almost effortlessly to others. Closure lands via a modest resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is excellent: who, where, when, and the core project are anchored quickly, and the accumulative/textural drive is stable. Structurally, the piece moves cleanly from setup and backstory to the present experiment and ends with a Conceptual Repricing of her goal. The causality is simple but coherent: surgery → bells attracting people → idea of artificial pilgrimage → present test with volunteer → realization. The main limitation is that nothing seriously threatens the experiment or her aim, so the closure’s cost is more conceptual than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean for this length: brief backstory, present-tense teaching and making, then a closing vigil that reconfigures their stance toward time and grief. Causality is modest but clear—Mara’s rock bottom leads to the observatory, which enables her renewed craft, which then enables taking on Senna, which culminates in the crane with the observatory’s coordinates. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they move from isolated drowning to a shared, ongoing practice of guiding others. Stakes are internal and relatively low-key, but there is a legible before/after around Mara’s willingness to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: Marcus arrives with a specific problem, Vesper studies, discovers the mapping function, and together they decode and reframe the inheritance. The structure is tight for the length—single-scene with light backstory woven in—and the closure (conceptual repricing of divination/data and inheritance) lands on the page. However, the decoding process is largely frictionless; no attempt ever truly fails or complicates matters before they succeed, so the path feels smooth rather than pressured. This keeps it strong but short of top-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive at pagoda → gain access → absorb escalating memories → reinterpret the Kaen’s legacy → decide how to respond. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each crystal deepening her understanding and narrowing interpretive options until she reaches a conceptual repricing of “forbidden wisdom.” Closure is on-page and legible: she chooses to complete the archive and return with a different purpose. The only limitation is that external stakes and concrete obstacles remain minimal, keeping the frame almost entirely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: current-time investigation → flashback/context → conceptual realization → decision, with clear causal links (the footage comparison leads to the insight, leading to the copying and planned sharing). The drive lens is accumulative/textural—each layer of description and backstory thickens the critique of commodified dreams until the conceptual turn about “shadows” lands. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Sera reframes what hope-preservation means and chooses a new path, with a legible before/after in her stance toward the archive. The main limitation is that consequences remain mostly offstage and abstract, but the on-page cadence shift is clear and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: exposure → disgrace → retreat to the workshop → re-examination of methods → decision to rebuild the research honestly. Reflection is well-anchored in present stimuli (thermometer, journal, shed skin) and constantly feeds the current choice set, so the structure never feels like a summary dump. Closure is a decisive change—she commits to a new methodology and public confession of past fraud—with clear long-term cost implied. The on-page escalation is mostly internal and quiet, but the scene’s progression from shattered certainty to active reconstruction is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clear: meteor hush → plant-telepathy → investigation → roses’ partial testimony → table’s deeper memory → revelation about Venn → pivot from closure to justice. The structure smoothly braids present action with backstory in a single, coherent scene, and the hourglass beat closes it with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing of her quest. The cost—accepting that her trusted doctor killed her sister and that this is now about justice, not just understanding—is legible without being overstated. A slightly more dramatized moment of decision or resistance (internal or external) could have heightened the sense of a turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Celeste arrives with a specific mission, uses psychometry on the film strip, follows the resulting visions to the box, and then the map leads to her final plan. The structure is a single coherent scene with one meaningful tightening when the unused love is revealed as an actual mapped phenomenon. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: she can’t restore past chances, so she redefines what “returning” love can mean. The cost—irretrievability of the original connections—is clear on the page and shapes her final choice, even if external resistance is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: pilgrimage to the archway → meeting the Keeper → shared vision via the astrolabe → attempt with deliberate imperfection → dissolution/freedom → reflective exit. Causality holds under a primarily accumulative lens: each move deepens the central idea rather than surprising via plot twists, and the final shift in stance is legible and earned. Closure is strong: freeing the Keeper and recognizing her own risk of calcifying creativity forms a clear before/after with conceptual cost. Stakes remain a bit abstract and internal, which limits impact at the most competitive level.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: approach the dune → perform the charm → meet the traveler → receive the meta-book → depart with a reweighted sense of time and hope. Causality within the premise holds, and the closure unit (the clock’s single tick and the world “dreaming through her”) is on the page with a clear before/after conceptual shift. The dominant stake is situational and thematic—whether possibility can still be cultivated after total ecological loss—and the ending crystallizes that into a charged stasis rather than a decisive victory. The lack of tactical obstacles limits dynamism, but the design does what it sets out to do.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: waking with a new gear, traveling to the clearing, assembling the mechanism, revelation that the forest maps his mind, and a quiet, forward-looking close. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: the recurring sleep-translocation and gear pattern logically lead to the mechanism’s completion and the conceptual repricing of the forest as consciousness. Closure lands as a clear conceptual shift (recognizing sleep as methodology and forest as neural map), though the cost is mostly implied, not dramatized. There are no orientation issues or glaring causal gaps, but the stakes remain low-key and mostly intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: loss → encounter with guides → indirect journey + confession → reframed quest → decision to follow Luna/courage. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: each reflective beat is prompted by a concrete pause or crossroads and shifts options or understanding. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise: Mara explicitly chooses forward motion away from home and leashes, with the cost of leaving safety and the dog still unfound. Stakes and world-logic never wobble, though the external search remains mostly conceptual rather than materially constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: staircase → encounter with Silent-Choir → music room confrontation → revelation → playing, with backstory anchored concretely to present cues. Causality is intact, and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative with causal turns (each discovery deepens and slightly redirects her understanding). Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: her idea of “the cost of safety” shifts in the final paragraphs with visible emotional cost. Nothing crucial feels elided or patched over.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: corrupted marginalia → arrival of the ink pellet → use of the rune → worldwide exposure of the pretender. Closure is decisive and legible, with a before/after in the realm’s political reality and in the texts themselves. The drive lens reads as Causal and holds through the end, though the decisive struggle remains fully off-stage (the pretender never appears). The cost is conceptual rather than personal, which slightly flattens the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous data → cross-referenced archives → radio confirmation → Morse-code realization → actionable decision to deploy sensors and report. Structure is tight for the length, and closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: human activity inscribed into oceanic “memory,” with Mara shifting from observer to interpreter. The early manifestation of the ghost current is a solid inciting deviation, though the 73-year cycle and Morse deciphering arrive with slight convenience. Still, the ending provides a legible before/after in knowledge and stakes with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from searching → discovery of the circle → deciphering the message → forming a new plan. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens: each sensory escalation (hum, light, text) justifies the next level of insight. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—the rebellion is redefined rather than reignited—and the before/after is legible. The cost of that reconfiguration, however, remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → decoding → cavern → embryo → unsealing → transformed mission, with no major logic gaps. The structure fits a single-arc, causal drive and lands clear closure via Naja’s transformation and decision to carry the gift to others. However, the descent and unsealing proceed with little resistance or complication; the forbidden cavern and Authority ban are more premise than on-page pressure. The cost of this new state—personally and politically—is mostly implied rather than confronted in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—moving between present tending, past trauma, and her developed method—reads clean and coherent, with a clear before/after reconfiguration by the end. Reflection is anchored in concrete present cues (helicopter sound, jasmine, light) and doesn’t blur orientation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she reaffirms the stance of cultivating life while carrying grief, with visible cost. The main limitation is the absence of a sharper on-page turning point; the piece primarily consolidates an already-achieved adaptation rather than dramatizing a new shift.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is tight: discovery of the box → cards laid out → walls closing with each placement → mandala completion and reality “repricing.” Causality is symbolic yet coherent—the more she orders the cards, the more pressure mounts, culminating in the re-expansion once she “unlocks” authentic sight. The closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing with an associated life-direction change (new kind of painting). A minor limitation is that the physical rules of the space remain a bit impressionistic, though not to the point of disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: track → discover messages → decode ink trails → locate Vera → decide to take her in, with the drone as a running external pressure. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single continuous scene fits the length and stakes well. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he fulfills his mandate while conceding internally to the pull of her research, reweighted by the final ink image. The main limitation is that the decisive act (arrest) feels almost too easy—no on-page complication meaningfully threatens his ability to do either job or conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: clandestine letter → ethical dilemma at Vault Seven → decision to wake Dr. Chen → act of burning the letter and logging the breach, with dormant networks responding. Closure is decisive and legible: she crosses a point of no return that will upend her life and likely the world order. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with reflection interleaved, all in service of that central choice. A minor weakness is that many of the highest-stated stakes remain off-stage and abstract, so the structural weight leans heavily on exposition rather than dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single pressured encounter with a clear before/after: will the dome be sacrificed and the daughter absorbed into the father’s world. Causality is coherent—Kael’s implied threat and lie provoke Mira’s quiet defiance, which in turn produces his de-escalation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in his sheathing the blade and accepting tea, foreclosing the path of immediate capitulation or rupture. The external magistrate pressure is revealed to be mostly false, which slightly softens the sense of looming consequence beyond this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival → preparation → casting silence → contact with the echo → reversion of the sky/garden → departure with a transformed interior state. Causality is intact and easy to trace, with each beat flowing naturally (she acts, the garden and sky respond, then the goddess’s echo arrives). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s patterns reset but Mara does not, and that before/after line is legible. The main limitation is that the cost of success is mostly implied, not sharply foregrounded in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s call → documents in the observatory → application of “proof by contradiction” → reinterpretation of the retraction → decision to publish. Structure is a single, coherent scene interwoven with tightly-anchored backstory, and the lens (causal with a strong conceptual overlay) holds consistently. Closure is on-page and meaningful: her stance toward both her father’s actions and her own obligations decisively shifts, with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that very little concrete external resistance manifests in the present, so the decision’s risk remains more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain from impossible time phenomena → letter → lab → haunted firmware → amber-bridge realization → reconfiguration of the code is clear and coherent under a causal lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/partial decisive change: she changes the system and her stance toward her guilt, with the price (years of haunting and self-blame) carried into but not erased by the ending. The time-folding and the future letter loop are legible without over-explaining. The only slight weakness is how effortlessly the amber “port” works once pressed, but it does not undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → drawing → tile use → gathering crowd → emergent hush → redefinition of meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the shift from searching for lost content to discovering “the place where meaning lived” is clear and earned. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with no orientation or rule violations. The cost of that closure (living with ongoing unlearning and only a fragile framework) is implied more than dramatized, which keeps this from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear: one present-tense scene in the ruined plaza, punctuated by retrocognitive visions that are causally triggered by the tessera. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Layla uses the mechanics of her punishment to create the “Memorial of Unbroken Names,” loosening the loop and reweighting the plaza’s meaning. Cost is legible in the knowledge that “the regime would come for her eventually” and in the months of torment she’s endured, though the present scene’s tactical pressure is relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: theater closure → orientation to garden/grave → discovery of coin → deliberate final performance → multi-time audience → dissolution into the setting, with clear causal steps under an accumulative/lyric lens. The fractured timeline is handled coherently enough that orientation never meaningfully slips, and the story teaches its pattern early then pays it off in the climax. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Margaux’s existence shifts from unstable, looping ghost to distributed presence in the orchard, with the encore achieved in a new form. The main structural limitation is that the “price” of success is mostly conceptualized after the fact rather than dramatized beat-by-beat as an escalating dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: static shock + defective pill → new perception → mapping as proposed solution. The backstory is efficiently anchored and feeds directly into present action. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment in “We start tomorrow,” with a clear before/after, though the decision comes without much resistance or complication, so the felt cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: established routine → anomalous non-human emotions → contact/overwhelm → transitional-object insight → charged mapping and communion → emerging with transformed maps. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the caves’ sentience and her new role reframe everything prior, but the lack of concrete, tested stakes means the cost at the end is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: hourglasses speeding → discovery of button archive → recognition of pattern → tactical use of the canyon echo and charts → communal uptake that slows time. Causality and stakes are coherent, and the closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing in which time’s behavior is reweighted by context and connection. The cost is mostly conceptual—risk of the warehouse becoming a tomb—rather than a sharply felt on-page loss, which keeps this just below elite. Still, the before/after in how time moves is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: pillbox → trek to bluff → recognition of codes → time pressure from thaw → enlistment of Emma → documentation → internal revaluation at the edge. The piece adheres to a single throughline and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where Marcus’ stance toward himself and his role reconfigures. The cost is present but understated (risk to Emma, re-entering a dangerous world is mostly implied rather than dramatized). Structure is tight and uncluttered, though largely linear and unsurprising in its turns.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous crossing framed by fog → revelation → conceptual shift as they reach the far bank. Causality is modest but coherent—her questions and disclosures lead to his key line about the needle being “for making space,” which in turn triggers her reorientation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: she abandons the quest for one “true” layer, with a felt cost in relinquishing clarity. The drive lens (accumulative/situational) is stable throughout, and there are no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: a single, coherent encounter that moves from arrival, to revelation via the lantern, to an explicit thematic clarification, to a reconfigured departure. Causality is clear—her methodical journey leads to the oasis, the lantern grants access to timelines, the beekeeper’s explanation reframes what she’s seeing, and this drives her decision to “take” the glass conceptually. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she leaves with a new understanding and mandate, and the oasis is reweighted as a temporal anchor of kindness. The cost is subtle but present as a burden of carrying this fragile ethic back into a burning world.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one evening’s rounds across fire escapes, framed by the rosebush’s last petal and the decision about the gauge tooth. Causality is modest but coherent—each plant visit and mirror adjustment accumulates toward her realization that she’s continuing her father’s work and that the neighborhood is beginning to respond. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her mission to “measure light and shadow” crystallizes in the plan to mount the gauge, with the implied cost of ongoing labor and remembered loss.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-moment work in the library, backstory of reincarnation, then the catalytic arrival of the new book leading to a reframed stance. Causality under a textural lens holds—new objects (the sundial, the book) are motivated by the setting’s rules, and each addition deepens the central question rather than feeling random. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she conceptually reprices her “brokenness” into “multiplicity” with the library and sundial reweighted in the last paragraphs. The cost is present but subtle, residing in the lingering loneliness and the quiet decision to endure as a bridge rather than erase one self.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, with clear orientation at the temple, building from invitation → revelation of the installation → revaluation of Margot’s work → her choice to add her own letter. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the spiral of objects and associated memories steadily reweights the central question of what Margot’s letters mean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from outside the pattern to joining it, with visible emotional cost. There are no causality breaks or confusing transitions, and the ending’s before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: campus phenomena → recognition of converging signals on the tower → Mara’s subsonic gambit → tricksters reorient and campus tension eases. The drive lens reads as largely Causal with a mild accumulative texture from the campus vignettes, and closure lands via a Decisive Change in the entities’ approach plus a Resonant Reconfiguration of the “game.” Cost is on the light side—Mara “buys time” with no clear sacrifice beyond risk and strain—so the before/after is structurally sound but not searing. Orientation is impeccable: who/where/when and stakes are clear early and never wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: study of blueprints → descent at a strategically chosen time → following the organ’s note → discovery and decoding of the disc → conceptual shift about the city’s geometry and ownership. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single-scene structure supports a tight drive toward the Key. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what the Key is and what the mutiny meant are both redefined, and Mara emerges with knowledge that alters future options. The primary limitation is that the on-page cost of achieving this shift remains modest, keeping the climax more cerebral than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: quarry → commission → method → portrait → witnesses → implied case progress → Morrison’s visit and realization. Structure is linear with a brief time jump, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing about recognition and empathy rather than a decisive event. The lack of a concrete turning scene (the investigation jump is summarized) keeps the arc relatively soft, but it remains coherent and satisfying at this scale. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: journals arrive → decoding reveals wound-door beneath station → Mira decides to go, asks Kao to join → they head into the cold, giving a Charged Poise closure. Structure is tight, one coherent scene with backstory interwoven via present cues (journals, nail, weather). Closure has conceptual cost implied (risk of exile, stepping out of the world) but the price is more gestured at than felt on the page. A slightly sharper articulation of what she tangibly risks losing “now” would strengthen the ending’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story holds clean causal and accumulative structure: hitchhiker’s vanishing → discovery of glass flake → noticing scaffold code → musical translation → resolution of the liminal figures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she expands her bridge-song role to a new ontological scale and then drives on, changed. Stakes are legible but somewhat abstract, with the liberation of “pixelated” figures more conceptual than dramatized beyond the final crossing image. Still, the throughline is coherent, and there are no causality breaks or unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-time encounter on the platform, interleaved with backstory about the startup and robber lineage, all feeding the central question of whether the father will return to the roads. The causal chain is modest but solid—collapse → father’s relapse into robbery → Marco’s creation of a safe territory → father’s return → the offer to stay and learn the markers. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: no definitive renunciation, but the father’s request (“Show me your markers tomorrow”) materially reconfigures the future and carries clear cost and risk. Nothing important teleports or contradicts itself; stakes scale appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: Ashwin’s death and telegram lead to Mara’s obsession, which leads to the joint decoding, which reveals the priests’ intent and reconfigures how Mara and Elias proceed. The single-scene structure with brief, well-anchored backstory shards stays clear, and the drive lens (causal with thematic accumulation) is stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the burden and method of reading the inscriptions are repriced from solitary genius to necessary collaboration, and they make a concrete new choice (publishing together). Stakes remain modestly scaled, but structurally the piece is sound and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failed mirror trick → boy lost → druid hired → systematic search → discovery of the curse’s nature → tactical shift → release and return. Orientation (who/where/why) is very clear early, and the scene follows one continuous arc with no confusing jumps. Closure lands: the rescue succeeds, the vortex calms, the forbidden seeds are neutralized, and Maren’s final stance reframes “lostness” with a conceptual cost. The main limitation is that consequences feel contained and relatively low-risk beyond this single incident; nothing in the structure compounds into a harder price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single causal scene: prophecy arrives early → covenant breaks → they choose to link through scars → a new shared dream/covenant emerges. Orientation is crisp from the first line; the rules of this altered reality are suggested through action rather than exposition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they move from parallel, thwarted visionaries to a merged entity capable of guiding an unstable future. The main structural limitation is that the price of this choice remains mostly conceptual, with little concrete narrowing of future options dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored by a brief, relevant backstory block, all under a clear causal lens (past trade → present misfit joy → failed reversal → new path). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Marcus agrees to “do the harder thing,” foreclosing further bartering as an option. Cost is legible: he chooses real pain over magically altered emotion. The only limitation is that the reversal ritual’s partial failure is told rather than dramatized, slightly dampening mid-story turning pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: present-moment task (appraise a crate) triggers a crisis of confidence rooted in the earlier Ming-vase failure, leading to a choice to trust instinct. Causality is straightforward and legible—no orientation issues—and the closure unit (his decision to declare the bottles genuine and to abandon “confident uncertainty”) lands with a felt cost. The scope is modest but appropriate for the length; one meaningful tightening occurs when he hesitates mid-appraisal. Some external stakes (bank, shutdown) remain mostly atmospheric rather than structurally stressed, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mentor’s death → seed inheritance → planting → instantaneous growth → fruit → conceptual realization → new plan. The story adheres to a single-scene structure with no orientation issues and lands a clear Conceptual Repricing closure about transition and grief. The main limitation is that most turns come from the seed’s inherent magic rather than Emilia’s difficult choices, which keeps the structural arc strong but not quite bracing. Still, the before/after in her understanding is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a brief, well-anchored explanatory backstory that clarifies the premise of “after tomorrow disappears.” Drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, building the rules and images of the library until the encounter with the woman crystallizes them. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the woman partially reclaims wonder and language (“I’ll return it tomorrow”) under the new rules. The main limitation is that the inciting pressure and the final shift are both fairly gentle; nothing in the sequence meaningfully constrains options beyond mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: inspection → discovery of shrine → reading the shell → activation of radiance → redefinition of purpose. The piece delivers a solid Conceptual Repricing closure: Marcus’ understanding of bunkers and his role is reweighted with visible cost (his past complicity and new burden). Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation debt and one meaningful tightening when the pearl warms and the caves respond. The stakes remain mostly conceptual, but within that frame the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative: repeated visits, scientific rituals, and graffiti exchanges build toward the day-29 center-of-river moment and the final bathroom inscription. Causality is coherent—each new act (photographing graffiti, adding her own messages, wading deeper) follows naturally from the last and tightens the internal inquiry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: forgiveness reconceived as current rather than destination, with a clear before/after stance. The emotional and narrative cost of that stance is still relatively soft-focus, keeping the piece out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: letters → watch/cipher → library navigation → discovery of grandmother’s book → broader lineage volumes → reweighted understanding at exit. The piece delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing closure: the quest’s purpose shifts from revenge/evidence to comprehension/human loneliness, and the library’s status changes from lost to accessible. Reflection and backstory are anchored in present stimuli (the watch, the book) and don’t break momentum or orientation. Stakes and obstacles are more contemplative than sharply pressured, but within this mode the structure feels tight and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with an inciting image (the impending dissolution at dawn), a central dilemma revealed via coffee divination, and a clear decision that reconfigures her tactics. Causality is tight—because the violin will melt and courts are slow, therefore the official report is sanitized and the true one is widely propagated. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts personal risk to keep the monks’ hope alive and seed broader resistance. There are no orientation issues, and the time pressure stays legible through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and a coherent accumulative drive from preparation to charged viewing moment. Causality is simple but intact—each action (chip placement, oils, mirrors) contributes to building toward the brief, liminal illumination. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Lyra “captures” the spark in a crystallized moment of beauty that will fade, which reweights the preceding work. The cost (its transience, the girl’s irrevocable death) is implicit but legible in the dawn deadline and the “unfinished” youth.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense visit to the grotto threaded with concise backstory that always orients back to the scene. Causality is coherent—Keiko’s grief and caretaking lead to the cedar, the grotto, the monthly returns, the fishermen observation, and finally the reframe of contentment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing when the woman/mother fuses and the hairpin is passed on. Stakes remain intimate and mostly internal, which works, but there’s room for one more concrete on-page test of her unrest.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: Vincent’s aftermath → crisis of certainty → pilgrimage to the lighthouse → conversation → reframed stance. The scene is well-contained in one visit with a clear turn when she realizes she offered “certainty when he needed wisdom.” Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change plus a Conceptual Repricing: she explicitly changes how she will work and the lighthouse/shard are reweighted in the final image. The structure is simple but elegant, with no missing steps or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a clear causal throughline: the student's arrival → demonstration → trance → conceptual revelation → bittersweet closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: we leave with the cost of her reverse aging (inevitable forgetting) against the success of transmitting knowledge. The accumulative/textural lens—ripples, magnetism, sycamore hush—builds toward that final conceptual repricing without confusion. Some explanation of the grotto and starlight edges toward expository aside but doesn’t break momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single accumulative scene: Canyon → arrowhead reading → raven pattern → diagnosis of tower fracture → commitment to repair. Causality is coherent and easy to trace, and orientation (who/where/what problem) is established early. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael moves from summoned uncertainty to a clear plan and stance, with time/effort as the implied cost. The main limitation is that the danger of failure (collapse of navigation networks) remains abstract and untested on the page, so the ending feels contemplative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: climb → ritual attempt → repeated failure → subtle shift → vision and reframing, all in one continuous scene. Causality is straightforward and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each beat deepens rather than resets. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “underachievement” and “magic” mean, with a clear before/after. The simplicity of external action keeps it from feeling architecturally ambitious, but it suits the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc under an accumulative/textural lens: lamplighting → dive → discovery → re-seeing the lanterns, with the grandfather’s backstory anchored sensibly to on-page stimuli. Orientation (who/where/when) is firm from the first paragraph, and the ship/library reveal is well-prepared by the maps and records. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mara’s understanding of her work and the lantern ritual shifts in a clear before/after way, with a stable lens. The main limitation is that the structural stakes remain modest—no real jeopardy or reversal affects her options, so the turn is primarily intellectual rather than structurally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece has a clean arc: present-tense observation of a worsening cosmic crisis → coin throw and static spike → revelation about backwards instructions and final frequency → collective preparation → transformation at the Crunch. Causality is legible and the three-day deadline plus accelerating collapse give a structural spine, even if largely summarized. Closure is solid—a decisive shift from mortal observers to aligned consciousnesses, with an intelligible before/after and implied cost of bodily existence. The main limitation is how frictionless the middle feels; once the premise is revealed, no substantial obstacle complicates execution.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense contemplation in the observatory, intercut with tightly focused backstory about Daniel and the predecessor, all resolving in a conceptual but legible turn at the end. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: recordings → recognition of the echo → re-evaluation of her own choice → decision to name and carry her fear. Closure is strong, with the act of tucking the atlas page by her heart and extinguishing the lights functioning as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. There are no orientation or lens-clarity problems at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: failed ocean → mysterious bell → Emris’s long observation and theory → reconstruction → bell’s ringing restores some balance. Backstory is well-anchored in present action and never confuses the when/where; the single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change in the world plus a reconfiguration of Emris’s inner state, and the cost (exhaustion, long road to full repair) is legible. The only ceiling here is that the world-scale stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than brought into direct on-page crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal thread is clean: wind chime silence → Marcus investigates → photograph trail → encounter with Eleanor → shared act of remembering → wind chime rings at dawn. The story operates under a mainly accumulative/textural lens, with the resurfacing town and accumulating stories deepening the situation rather than driving a big external turn. Closure lands in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus now holds a reweighted understanding of his job and the town (“proof that beneath every surface, meaning waits…”), with the cost of knowing it will drown again. Structure is straightforward and well-contained to one scene and one dominant drive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow: she enters the hidden orchard, secures the crystal, performs the experiment, and completes the formula, with the starlings’ appearance as a logical outgrowth of her earlier insight. Structure is tight—a single main scene with one well-anchored flashback—and orientation is secure from the outset. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: we exit with a completed Opus and a reweighted sense of science/intimacy, but the promised possibility of the work “consuming her” never meaningfully constrains tactics or choices. As a result, the ending feels resolved but somewhat low-cost and mildly pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: radio contact → challenge to her report → escalation to Command → defended explanation → reaffirmed mandate. Causality holds throughout; each beat stems from the prior one, and the backstory about the failed predecessor is anchored and relevant. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she keeps her methods and integrity, with a clear before/after in Command’s stance and her recharged commitment. The plot is somewhat low-amplitude and predictable once the conflict is defined, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds to a single continuous scene with clean orientation and a coherent, situational drive focused on the custody decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the binary choice (one mother) is rejected in favor of a complementary joint custody, with visible conceptual cost. Causal beats are clear—Kira’s admission, her argument about balance, Clone-Kira’s conditional acceptance—though the court’s pressure remains offstage and the negotiation resolves a bit smoothly. Structure is solid but could benefit from one more concrete test or pushback before agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious envelope → research → realization of sabotage → choice at the brook, with a clear before/after in her stance toward the “puzzle.” The piece maintains single-POV, one primary scene, no orientation issues, and the closure (refusing the coordinates and deciding to warn others) is on the page with an Earned Stasis feel. Stakes are mostly conceptual/professional rather than viscerally dramatized, which keeps escalation modest. Nonetheless, setup elements (seed, coordinates, obsession with puzzles) pay off coherently at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: entrance and ritual → inciting interruption by Sarah → shared performance → quiet comedown and tomorrow’s decision. Causality is coherent and accumulative—the ritual precedes and enables the joint catharsis, and the closure (their decision to return together) lands with a visible emotional cost. The brief backstory paragraph is anchored and tilts present action rather than derailing it. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, but it’s fully legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: stolen Codex → chase into dream → pendant destabilizing her → deliberate decision to destroy it in the vulnerable realm. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous scene with brief but well-anchored backstory and a clear before/after at the end. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (pendant destroyed, garden shattered, waking human) and a lingering constraint (collar, continued guardianship). Escalation is a bit linear—once she decides to grab the pendant, there are no real turns or complications—keeping this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: Church request → Cassia’s choice to violate taboos → ritual → crozier’s transformation → revaluation of self and authority, with no major orientation or logic slips. Closure is solidly on-page—a decisive change in both object and self-concept—with a conceptual cost in her break from inherited constraints and embrace of danger. However, the central ritual proceeds almost too smoothly once begun; there’s little on-page complication or risk manifesting during the act itself. The global drive reads as Causal with a thematic overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: climb → failed conventional listening → conceptual gamble → discovery of the fragment → integration and revaluation of silence. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens; each step follows from her dissatisfaction and method shift, and the shard integration credibly triggers the final reconfiguration. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing of silence and endings, with a marked before/after in her practice. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps it below the very top band but still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: empty hourglass → phasing ferry → diagnosis of pattern collision → tactical use of the grotto and hourglass to merge timelines. Structure is straightforward single-scene escalation into the grotto climax and an on-page Decisive Change with the merged timeline and stabilized ferry. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless: once Mateo reads the hourglass, the confluence solution unfolds without real setbacks, trade-offs, or visible cost beyond conceptual change. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens (causal) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Marina’s long-term problem (shifting memories) motivates entry into the gallery, discovery of the room, and the act of weaving, which produces the climactic realization. The structure is a single, coherent scene with a well-defined before/after and a clear conceptual repricing at the end. The cost of this new understanding—living with unstable memories—is present but more stated than dramatized, which keeps the closure from landing at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-time descent and lesson framed by succinct backstory, building to the trench scene where understanding crystallizes. Causality is straightforward—her obsession leads to descent, to instruction, to the demonstration at the city’s edge. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration: navigation is redefined as traveling edges between realities, and the final image of tracing constellations alongside the alien clearly marks a before/after in her knowledge. Stakes remain largely intellectual/spiritual rather than dramatically tested, which keeps this out of the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious pulse → investigation of hearing aid → revelation of abuse pattern → Lily’s arrival → Mira’s concrete response in making calls. The structure holds as a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory that’s efficiently anchored by present stimuli (the hearing aid, the photo). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the meaning of Margaret’s “call” is fulfilled and converted into real-world help, with a clear before/after in Lily’s situation. The main limit is that the danger and logistical difficulty of extraction are gestured at rather than concretely pressured in-scene, so the sense of immediate cost and narrowing options at the end is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara descends with a six-hour clock, studies the codex, waits for tidal phase transition, witnesses the entities, documents them, then escapes as flooding resumes. The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative thematic overlay, and the closure (Earned Stasis/CR: she chooses testimony over institutional erasure) lands clearly. Cost is present but modest—her physical risk and effort, not a serious near-failure or loss. Structure is linear and tight, but the climax is observational rather than confrontational, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: past accident and data loss → present attempt to recover Chen’s work → failed standard methods → chaos-theory-inspired ink experiment → reconstruction → revelation of Chen’s deliberate risk. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with backstory efficiently cued by present stimuli and never derailing the scene. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: she reinterprets the core event, with visible emotional cost paid in years of misplaced guilt. The one-night span and single location keep the drive focused and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival with a cursed object → observation and inference → experiment → night-long labor → renunciatory closure. Causality is solid under a textural lens: birds, light, bone, and diamond interact in a clear chain that enables the new language. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she trades her singular, embodied language for a communal, eternal translation encoded in the canyon. The only limitation is that the shift from “curse” to “transformative tunnel” happens very smoothly, with little on-page resistance or risk of failure, so structural pressure never feels truly precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with a brief, well-anchored flashback to Voss that directly tilts Maya’s present stakes. The drive lens reads as Situational tending toward Accumulative: pressure accrues via the arrowhead, the phone call, and the revelation of Voss’s laugh. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment—she pockets the arrowhead, implicitly nearing the “choice” others have made—but we don’t quite see a decisive before/after act, only a new stance. The cost (threat to career, identity) is implied rather than concretely dramatized, which softens the structural punch at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: orchard discovery → locust shell → experimental song on the bridge → citywide and orchard transformations → conceptual realization. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong causal backbone and accumulative textural escalation. Closure is solid: the world has clearly changed, the statues are gone, the orchard blooms, and Mira’s understanding of “breaking free” is reweighted with a visible price (destroyed violin, collapsed enforcement system). Slight softness comes from the lack of on-page counterforce reacting to her “dangerous” act, which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The through-line (get the illicit package safely across in a narrow time window under drone surveillance) is clean and causally sequenced, with the null-field and abandoned arcade elegantly solving a concrete problem. The global drive reads Hybrid: situational pressure from the border/drone regime plus causal tactics in the arcade, ending in a conceptual repricing of “absence” as resistance. Closure lands via the transfer of the storm bottle and the reweighted final image of connection in a place designed to sever it, with an implicit cost in ongoing risk and moral defiance. The main limit is that the piece never quite tightens into a single sharp turn—no beat forces a new tactic or painful trade-off; it’s more a well-executed execution than a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: find halo → install → test crown, interleaved with a concise backstory that’s cleanly anchored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sculpture’s first full song and spin, crystallizing his long project and his relationship to silence. Cost is subtle—years of solitude and singular focus more implied than dramatized—but present enough for a quiet piece. Stakes remain small and inward, which limits structural impact despite the satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: opening routine → theory and mapping → experiment → subtle awakening → reweighted understanding at dawn, with clear before/after. Causality is consistent—her choice to enact the ritual “reawakens” the library—though stakes remain mostly conceptual. The closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the library revealing itself as the physical locus of stories, with time and space subtly altered as a cost. Structure is clean and linear for this length, with no orientation issues or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent: discovery of the cipher → methodical expeditions → cave revelation → choice to step into the light, all under a clean single-POV frame. The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric drive with causal elements, and the closure (her choosing to “become equally untethered”) is legible and earned. Much of the story’s middle is told in summary rather than broken into distinct on-page turns, which flattens some potential escalation. The cost of leaving her old life is implied more than concretely staged, but the before/after is still clear.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: Mara meets the locksmith → learns the ribbon’s secret → descends beneath the nexus → encounters the book → accepts a new role. The drive lens reads as causal with a conceptual repricing at the end (the city-as-mind reframing all prior mystery). Closure is solid: Mara’s stance decisively shifts from avoidance to custodianship of dangerous knowledge, and the before/after is legible. The main limitation is the relative ease of success; no beat truly threatens failure or imposes a sharp on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: disappearing memories → investigation and pattern detection → dive to the greenhouse → decision to interact with the fairy ring → revaluation of preservation. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli and consistently alters Vera’s stance, fitting the length. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: she chooses to disturb the ring and reconceives what “preserving” means, with a legible cost. The only ceiling here is that external complications are minimal, so the structural pressure never grows truly severe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is a single, well-contained scene with clean orientation and a consistent accumulative/textural drive. Causality is modest but present: shard discovery → tea ritual → conversation about exile → Finn’s tentative engagement. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (both re-seeing exile and “brokenness”), with an emotional rather than plot-based cost. The structural limitation is that nothing truly decisive is risked or foreclosed; the before/after shift is meaningful but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: fading wonder → ritual with blood and seed → crossing into the dream realm → gathering essence → infusing the seed → planting. The structure fits a single continuous scene with one interior “shard” (the dream galleries) and returns smoothly to the parapet for closure. Closure is on-page and legible: the seed is transformed and planted, and the preservation of wonder is achieved with a felt, if quiet, cost (exhaustion, blood). The main limitation is that the near-inevitability of success softens any sense of structural risk.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: the fisherman’s burden → summoning Maren → methodical unraveling → release and reconfiguration of where the secrets reside. Structure is tight, one scene with a discernible build and a decisive change when the last knot comes free and the net dissolves. Closure lands with legible cost: the fisherman loses his secrecy and self-punishing burden, and the sanctuary takes it on as public memory. The only limitation is the lack of real uncertainty or complication once the method is introduced, which keeps the arc somewhat straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: reopening the vault → testing a hypothesis with parallel footage → discovering the shifted stone → interpreting it as a question → deciding to go to the henge. Causality holds and the accumulative drive (pattern perception and re-interpretation) is consistent throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the chapel is reframed from cursed relic to active, questioning map, and Maren’s future path is reoriented. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but still legible in her decision to move from preservation into risk and investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clear single-scene structure with reflection threaded through concrete discovery beats; orientation is impeccable. The causal line—explore library → find globe/journal → analyze wreck → write note → decide to leave both—is coherent and accumulative. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she changes how she relates to mystery and artifacts, with a visible cost (leaving the globe, abandoning collection impulse). The only minor limit is that external stakes remain low-intensity, keeping the structural tension mostly interior and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear throughline from arrival to completed mural and reciprocal acknowledgment. Causality is modest but coherent (she paints → the ghost is heard → it responds), and the closure beat (the ghost’s thank-you on her tools) lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the global drive feels more accumulative than climactic, with no real narrowing of options or costly turn. The piece reads as a polished vignette rather than a fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The elevator’s ascent provides a clean structural spine, with each floor marking progression in both plot and understanding. Causality is coherent: discovering the goggles → decoding the diary → reinterpreting the captain → re-evaluating her assignment. Closure lands as a clear Charged Poise/Decisive Change when she internally rejects the promotion path and commits to a different mode of being in the fortress. The structure is solid and elegant, though the stakes of the “summons” never manifest as concrete external pressure beyond the implied social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: drifting after the tether break, she moves through successive cloud encounters that deepen her theory and culminate in the final revaluation that “empty wasn’t empty” and the sky has an emotional archive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise rather than a decisive act, but it’s legible and earned by the pattern of observations. The main weakness is that the supposed external emergency never meaningfully constrains options or imposes a concrete cost in the ending, keeping the structural pressure relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: set-up of commission and condition, attempts and failure, reflective realization, final artistic adjustment, and departure as demolition begins. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid—each beat follows from the prior one, and the ending is a clear earned stasis/conceptual repricing. The demolition clock functions as situational pressure but remains mostly conceptual; there’s little on-page narrowing of options as time runs out. Strong closure is present, but the external stakes could be more tightly interwoven with her moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the luminance → losing the pencil → discovering hopscotch → decoding pattern → linking to constellation and Mara → adopting a secret plan. Structure holds as a single, continuous scene with one clear turn from idle observation to charged purpose, and closure lands as a Charged Poise decision with implied cost. Some stakes (the Guild’s hostility, Mara’s fate) stay off-stage and hinted rather than tested, which keeps the climax quiet rather than urgent. Nonetheless, the before/after in Celeste’s knowledge and options is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: scraps of prophecy → Hall of Mirrors → stalled mechanism → improvised repair → partial restoration of cosmic order, all in one coherent descent-and-return arc. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the mechanism restarts, eclipses normalize, and the world shifts from breakdown to precarious repair at the conceptual cost of accepting imperfection and ongoing labor. Stakes remain a bit abstract—“world’s foundations” and multiplied eclipses are more told than directly pressured on the page—but the before/after is legible. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the causal drive is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—from blight to social fracture to Mara’s orchestrated chalk exchanges to partial recovery—is clean and easy to follow. Structure is straightforwardly linear with one central tightening when the colonists start acting on the messages and Joren publicly reframes their approach. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community has shifted stance and Mara’s role has evolved from unseen organizer to acknowledged ally. The main weakness is that costs and obstacles feel smoothed over; collaboration comes a bit too easily once the mechanism appears, limiting structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: climb, reflection/backstory, adjustment, perception of branching futures, and a quiet but legible closure as she departs having paid the emotional cost. Causality under the accumulative/causal hybrid lens holds: the worsening global situation → “Clock demanded movement” → her careful adjustment → acceptance of the outcome and burden. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has moved the Clock closer to midnight yet seeded possible reversals, and commits to continue bearing this role. The main constraint at this level is that the global stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete causal pressures within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: we move from inheritance and duty to a specific rescue under time pressure with a clear causal chain. The realization that the orchard is the blueprint provides a satisfying reconfiguration and justifies her success. However, the solution comes relatively smoothly once she reads the nut; there’s no serious reversal or near-failure, so the climax feels a bit under-tested. Closure is nonetheless solid, with a legible before/after in Maren’s stance toward the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline—return to ravine with urn → perception of foam patterns → chrysalis → re-interpretation of Leah’s choice → decision to scatter ashes across all channels and reconnect with the living—is clear and contained in a single, coherent scene. Reflection is well-anchored in present stimuli and feeds directly into the final decision. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big event, but the before/after in Maya’s stance is legible and costly. A slightly stronger sense of external pressure or complication at the site could heighten structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a quiet opening, the inciting incident with the customer, the ritual of the bottle, then a reflective closure as the library “rebalances.” Causality is intact and easy to track, but the global drive feels primarily accumulative/textural—pressure never tightens much beyond the initial request. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: one story’s potential restart subtly reweights Vera’s enterprise. The cost is conceptual and understated rather than dramatically felt, which suits the mode but limits impact at elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: dream → fortress investigation → recognition of leaking remorse → descent via tidal pools → confrontation with coral ice → smoothing the memories → fortress no longer weeping. Orientation is swift and unobtrusive; stakes and world rules are legible very early. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: Maron has paid an emotional cost, the pavilion is stabilized “for another age,” and his tears reframe the initial contagion of grief. The only structural softness is how smoothly the large-scale crisis yields to a relatively compressed on-page working-through, which slightly flattens potential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: isolation → discovery of the grain’s song → composition attempts that don’t quite work → deployment of the cuckoo weight → communal response and transformed valley. The structure is linear and coherent with a clear before/after, and the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration with some cost (stealing from the historical society, unilateral action). The main weakness is that the resistance and price of her choice feel relatively low-stakes and swiftly resolved, slightly softening the impact of the climax. Still, for this length, the piece delivers a satisfying, legible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one anchored scene in the canyon, woven with backstory that directly informs the present experiment, and a clear movement toward connection with the canyon’s memories. The accumulative drive (increasing density of others’ memories) holds and culminates in a conceptual repricing where memory’s nature is redefined. Causality is mostly sound—her prior work leads to the device, which leads to the flood of memories—but the final “proving that nothing was ever truly lost” feels a shade too declarative and low-cost for maximal impact. Closure lands, but with more conceptual than dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: margin doodle → realization about inversion/threshold → return to grotto → harvesting combinations → emergence with a new role. The structure holds as a single, coherent window framed by a brief but anchored backstory, and closure lands via a decisive acquisition and mission shift. That said, the cost of this change is underplayed; there’s no on-page consequence that complicates or darkens her new power. Under a causal lens, the piece feels complete but slightly low-pressure for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single night’s work framed by a brief backstory of discovery, building to the performance and the birds’ return. Causality is sound—her prior research into stress cracks leads to this experiment, which leads to the grove’s response—and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where the world’s “silence” is revalued. The felt cost is modest but present in her long devotion and physical exhaustion, and the final before/after (no birds vs. birds watching) is legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: exile → eclipse deadline → need to reconstruct covenant via silence → realization → passing agency to the daughter. The piece achieves closure through a conceptual reconfiguration of what the covenant is (and why it “failed”) and a quiet earned stasis in Kavir’s choice to remain outside power. The main weakness is that the eclipse deadline and council confrontation stay abstract and off-stage, so the resolution feels more preparatory than climactic. Nonetheless, the before/after in understanding and options is legible and comes at a felt cost to Kavir’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene where prior off-page discovery (silence frequencies) motivates the present experiment, leading to a clear before/after once the clasp opens. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the layering of different “silences” builds coherently toward a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure is strong: the decisive change is Marlow’s renunciation of reading, with an on-page cost. The only limitation is that the mechanical opening of the lock offers little resistance, so the central “test” is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: seed acquisition → planting → escalating scent → internal re-evaluation → bloom and sharing, with no orientation or logic slips. The structure is essentially a single through-line with a compressed montage middle; it reads coherent and accumulative. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s stance toward discomfort and wisdom changes and she publicly embodies the new understanding. The main limitation is that the threatened extreme outcome (“save us or drive me from my own home”) never faces a concrete test, softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrow tip → unconventional method → Inversion window → echoes → sphere → conceptual shift, all within one continuous scene. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and closure is solid—she has materially found what she sought and reinterprets resilience. However, stakes are mostly intellectual and ecological; no concrete on-page jeopardy to her or the orchards actively threatens to derail the quest, so escalation is more implied than dramatized. Still, the structure is tight, with no orientation issues and no major loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → investigation → discovery of the spiral center → systemic realization → preventative action, all under a clear causal chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she shifts from retroactive analysis to proactive systems mapping, with the cranes’ reconfiguration embodying that turn. Orientation is strong from the opening and remains stable; there are no causality gaps. The main limitation is that turns are more intellectual than dramatically pressured, so the climax feels cool rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-time descent and encounter in the cavern, followed by a brief results coda, all under a single POV with clear orientation. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: legend → descent → sculpted hush awakens → evidence gathered → Council persuaded. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, where the meaning of the bells and “home” is reweighted. The one slightly soft link is the synchrony with the distant sculptor’s chisel, which feels more mythic than causally earned but does not undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal line is clean: she seeks the range, arranges driftwood, uncases the flute, plays, gains insight, then chooses to step through. The piece delivers a solid Decisive Change at the end (she abandons her world) and a Conceptual Repricing of the relic’s purpose. However, obstacles are almost entirely absent, so escalation feels more like an orderly unlocking than pressure narrowing options, and the cost of her choice is only lightly implied. Structure (single scene with brief, anchored backstory) is tidy and easy to track.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: messenger → fragment in the press → emotional residue → analytic work → conceptual realization, all in one coherent scene. Causality is intact, and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing when she reconceives emotions as expressions of a single force and continues working under the dying sky. The stakes (understanding emotion to anticipate/survive cosmic collapse) remain slightly abstract and are never brought to a concrete on-page decision point. Still, the before/after is legible and costs—time, identity, and cosmic attrition—are clearly present.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the vibrating pendant compels Kael into successive encounters, culminating in the Keeper’s explanation and Kael’s reframed mission. Structure is linear, well-oriented, and lands a clear closure beat (Conceptual Repricing: relics as agents of transformation rather than mere cargo). The main limitation is that the journey presents no serious obstacle or reversal beyond mild schedule slippage; escalation is mostly conceptual rather than situational. Still, for the length, the pattern of encounters → explanation → new choice is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elena goes to the arbor before the committee meeting, Hartley presents anomalous frost, the prism reveals emotional images, and he decides to support her. Structure is a single coherent scene with one clear turn (Hartley’s evidence and confession) leading to closure via their joint decision to face the committee. The main cost—the risk of Hartley’s professional reputation and the unresolved outcome with the committee—remains implicit but is legible. The offstage committee keeps the climax somewhat soft, but the closure still reads as a credible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present scene with interleaved backstory that all feeds the final crossing. Causality is solid—grandmother’s revelation → years of work → completion of the weaving → threshold crossing—with no rule changes or cheats. Closure is an on-page decisive change with clear cost as she steps into the raveling silence. Slightly more on-page testing or complication of her plan could have deepened structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of sap → plan for conduits → barter for awakenings → forging and threading → first tree revives; the closure (a tree budding and Mira recommitting) is clear and satisfying. However, the crucial middle phase (“They’d spent weeks threading…”) is summarized, so we never see genuine setbacks or complications that might test the plan. The global drive is Causal with a light accumulative texture, and that lens holds through the ending. Cost is present (the silk spent, the magician gone, the work ahead) but remains understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single scene anchored in the bay, with backstory threaded efficiently, leading to contact with Mira and the charged dilemma. The causal chain (finding shard → learning its rhythm → reaching Mira → revelation of the convergence → deferral of choice) is coherent and satisfying under a hybrid situational/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Kael consciously postpones the decision while fully grasping its stakes. The only limitation is that the climactic ethical choice is queued for “tomorrow” rather than forced to some partial resolution on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: letter → sea glass → lamp failure → emergency response → up-tower discovery → decision to continue the chain, culminating in her writing. Orientation is excellent—who/where/when and the drive are clear very early, and the time pressure from the helicopter adds a subtle clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from silent carrier of others’ truths to participant, with a felt emotional cost. The only limitation is that the repair problem (fuel line crack) is noted but then sidelined; the plot’s external stakes recess a bit quickly in favor of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: climb, preparation, activation, and an intensified climax once the light starts bending through time, all under one continuous scene. Causality is intact (ritual → storm response → temporal beam → green dawn) and the accumulative lens fits the lyric build. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s mornings have been subtly rewritten, and Kael’s routine is reweighted as world-sustaining rather than quaint. Stakes and cost stay more conceptual than felt, which keeps this out of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival → revelation about Yuki and the nature of the heart → offer to train → Mira’s commitment, all in one coherent scene. Causality holds: her pilgrimage leads to Chen’s explanation, which reframes her experiences and makes the choice to stay logical. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—she accepts a path of learning rather than fleeing or rejecting the gift. The cost (risk of being “consumed” by others’ pain) is gestured at more than concretely tested, which keeps this just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: pin/shift → assignment → ascent and mapping → entry into maze → iterative extraction → dawn resolution. Causality is coherent, and the accumulative drive (tree by tree, dream by dream) leads to a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. The “before dawn” deadline is not strongly dramatized, so temporal pressure feels soft rather than urgent. Closure lands: the maze is deconstructed, the trees revert, and Mara’s understanding of sorrow and maintenance has palpably shifted.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: preparation, ritual, intensification, and the dawn’s first stirrings, all under a single continuous scene. Causality is sound (song → fruit essence → weaving → communal resonance → pre-dawn), and there is clear closure as the world shifts from absolute night to pre-dawn while the song passes beyond Elora. The cost is more conceptual and emotional than contested—there is little sense she might fail—so the turn lands as a gentle but real reconfiguration rather than a hard decisive reversal. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: invitation → arrival at coffee shop → descent into Library → conversation → reframing and commitment to learn, all tracking causally from Iris’s mistake and pain. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the impossible Library’s rules are introduced smoothly enough to be accepted. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional shift—she reinterprets “staying while leaving” and chooses an ongoing path of learning, with the sister’s estrangement as the evident cost. The drive lens reads as primarily Situational with accumulative texture, and that lens holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: present-time approach → encounter in tea house → philosophical negotiation → actionable decision with a reweighted premise. Causality is intact (Mira’s noticing leads to the tea house, conversation leads to a new tactic) and the accumulative, lyric texture supports the conceptual closure. The closure unit—Mira leaving with seeds and a new mapping project—is legible and paid for emotionally. Stakes remain quiet and intimate but are coherent and consistently framed.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: routine cataloging, samples of faded vows, then the anomalous slide that reconfigures what Maren believes about promises. Causality is simple but solid—her methodical work leads to discovery; discovery leads to a private, rule-bending act and a conceptual shift. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes her purpose with a visible cost (secret-keeping, emotional exposure). Orientation is impeccable from the opening line; the single-scene design fits the length and aim.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: inherited token → contested betrayal story → planned meeting → reveal of recording and deadman’s switch → agreed truce. The single-scene structure with interleaved backstory is clear and well-paced, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: the truce alters both parties’ options with a palpable, if mostly implied, cost. A slightly more explicit sense of what continuing danger looks like could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: single scene with interleaved backstory, building toward the compass revelation and sibling reconciliation; causality is intact and the accumulative pattern is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: weather-carriers reframed as messengers and the compass now pointing toward a shared future. The cost is relatively soft—more conceptual than dramatized—which keeps the ending from feeling fully earned at a “prestige” level. Still, there are no orientation issues and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: lock → storage unit → painting/address → cave → hidden self-portrait → Elena’s drawing marathon → conceptual revaluation of memory. Structure stays within a single continuous scene with well-integrated flashback and no orientation issues. Closure lands solidly as a conceptual repricing of her “gift” with visible emotional cost and a clear before/after stance. The only limitation is that external obstacles are minimal, so progression feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: bodily response to lies → discovery under floorboards → painstaking map assembly → descent → revelation of grandmother’s role → offer → decision. The structure fits a single-POV, one-quest short story and closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid when Mira commits to delivering unsent words. However, the inheritance twist (“I knew you’d come”) and the Archive’s existence feel a bit convenient, with minimal on-page cost attached to the decision. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a light accumulative texture; that lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: ascent → installation of the ice → sound transformation → pilgrims’ arrival → realization and future-oriented decision. Causality is coherent, with the ice altering the bells, which draws pilgrims and precipitates Mira’s reframing of purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she abandons pure technical pursuit for a communal, wonder-preserving mission, with the melting ice as visible cost. Stakes are modest but appropriate to the lyrical, accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: the magnetic shift isolates the dome, the malfunctioning environment produces mutated roses, M4-RY’s box of fears creates static, prompting the “controlled burn” plan that fails to fully resolve things until the buried photograph reframes the problem. Structure is linear and focused, with backstory efficiently embedded and clearly anchored in present action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: M4-RY shifts from containment/erasure to integration, with the garden as the new logic. The only limitation is that external stakes remain fairly static, with little sense of ticking clock beyond the daily chime.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → mailbox key → hidden documents → collective realization and stance. Structure is linear and easy to follow, moving from courtyard setup to discovery to communal response, with a clear closure beat that reconfigures their situation without resolving the external threat. The cost—ongoing legal danger and the need to organize—is legible even though the direct confrontation is deferred. The piece could deepen tension in the middle (the mailroom scene is almost frictionless), but the overall architecture is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc—Elara returns to the lab, uses its tools and her methods to decode/encode, and we end on the concrete consequence of seventeen prisoners walking free. Structure is linear and legible, with backstory (coup, grandfather, regime) anchored in present action and not derailing orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her work has evolved beyond her grandfather’s into a living system of liberation, with a clear before/after in what the codes now do. The main limitation is that escalation is summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told she “worked through the night cycles” and decoded patrol patterns instead of seeing a specific, pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: whale beaches → gravity anomalies → diviners’ explanation vs. Maris’s suspicion → descent into chambers → reading patterns → cutting into the heart → choosing to stay. The structure—docks at dusk, then descent into the salt chambers—fits the length and maintains clear orientation with one major escalation. Closure is strong: the Decisive Change of entering and being enclosed in the heart reconfigures the world (gravity stabilizes) with a visible conceptual and emotional cost (her disappearance). If anything, the diviners’ thread and the city’s response sit slightly to the side of the main throughline and never directly pressure her choices, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: prophecy → crafted wing → nocturnal ritual → hushing → quiet return; the causal chain is legible with no orientation issues. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: the prophecy is neutralized and her chosen role is reaffirmed with cost in continued solitude and unacknowledged labor. The main weakness is the absence of a tangible setback or complication—the prophecy “stirring” never seriously threatens to win—which keeps the arc from feeling fully hard-won. Still, for a lyric piece, the drive lens holds and the cadence closes convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rooftop visit → inscription photo → seal reveal → lineage explanation → Elena’s confession → offer of apprenticeship → acceptance. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Elena’s understanding of herself and the buildings’ “language” is reweighted, and the seal-as-key image is effective. Still, the stakes and constraints remain low-intensity, with no genuine jeopardy or hard trade-off complicating her yes, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully decisive. The piece sits between causal and accumulative, but the hybrid lens holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: the envelope and invitation establish a concrete dilemma, the night in the garden accumulates weight, and dawn brings an earned refusal (Earned Stasis). Causality is straightforward—her past with her sister leads to the garden, which leads to the moral stakes of sharing her research. The “until dawn” clock and the return of the seashell provide a legible before/after stance with emotional cost. A deeper on-page test of that deadline or any serious temptation toward acceptance could have sharpened the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: years of forgery → this final decree → confrontation → revelation that the Magistrate has been tacitly abetting her → looming arrival of the Governor that will expose them. The single-scene structure is tight, and the sanctuary’s details (dripping stalactites, echoing space) are all oriented around the central act and its danger. Closure lands as a mix of Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: Mei’s understanding of the key and of “forgiveness” reconfigures the story’s premise, and the Magistrate’s impending downfall supplies cost. A slightly higher score would require one more concrete on-page complication or turn before the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: quest → descent → layered revelations via the shell → reorientation of purpose, all in one continuous scene. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each deeper step physically and conceptually unlocking more information and culminating in a closure beat where Mara redefines her relationship to echoes. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional—reframing her sister’s erasure as a social truth and a personal responsibility—and that repricing is legible on the page. The shell’s long explanatory monologue flirts with feeling a bit too neat, but it doesn’t break plausibility or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: recovery of the globe → shrine ritual → ghost contact → decision to bring truth to Evelyn, with no orientation issues. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: after the encounter, Maya’s mission concretizes around this specific mother–daughter link. The structure (preparation → encounter → vow) is efficient and scaled well to the length. Stakes stay intimate and are resolved mostly in intention rather than dramatized consequence, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a short reflective lead-in that clearly ties into the present stakes, and each move (whisk explanation, net-tangling, whistling) flows causally into the next. The core drive is accumulative/textural—the story layers images and ideas until the girl’s conceptual shift and the charged final image of the parapet and fireflies. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her “failure” is repriced as hidden effort with generational cost and blessing. Stakes are modest but coherent and fully paid off for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rumors → evidence in the soil → document reconstruction → coordinates → excavation → ethical choice, with no major logic gaps. The structure is a straightforward investigative arc that leads to a conceptual closure where Vera redefines what “truth” she’ll share. However, much of the key information (Project Stillpoint) arrives in an expository block rather than through dramatized obstacles or reversals. Closure lands, but the path there feels relatively safe and procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a continuous scene that moves from heightened signal, to direct address, to Elara’s choice, to her beginning to act on the instructions. Causality holds under a situational lens: because she has listened and persisted, the prophet singles her out, creating a decisive choice about allegiance. Closure is present—her allegiance shifts and the “rise” begins—but the stakes remain mostly conceptual and the price of the choice is only lightly implied, which mutes the impact of the ending. No orientation issues or broken setups, just a relatively low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clear: awakening and set-up, repair and capture of the lullaby, communal sharing in town, and a quiet but definite reconfiguration at the end. Causality is clean in accumulative mode—her obsession leads to jars, which lead to the music box experiment, which culminates in the town gathering and Mrs. Chen’s recognition. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: Cosima’s social position and self-understanding shift as she trades jars and music for coins and human connection, at the cost of giving up the box and remaining materially poor. Stakes remain low-intensity and there’s little genuine jeopardy, but for a quiet piece the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery of the key → revelation of the absolution chamber and its stakes → approach of antagonists → Meris’s tactical solution in the resonance chamber → reconfiguration of the key and status quo. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the threat isn’t destroyed but transformed, with Meris now literally bound to the artifact. The main structural weakness is the underused external threat; the silent boat and would-be intruders never concretely test her plan on the page, so escalation remains mostly anticipatory. Still, the scene reads complete and coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one night’s observing, interwoven with a month of prior work and generations of backstory, all oriented around a single decision to pursue a “patient revolution.” Causality under a textural lens holds: because of the family legacy and the viaduct’s symbolism, she chooses this method; because of the magnetic shifts and seasonal timing, she refines it. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she commits to her strategy and forecloses dramatic rupture—but the cost and future opposition remain mostly conceptual, which softens impact slightly. Orientation is excellent throughout; no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery of the lantern → noticing symbols → finding the chamber and documents → understanding Reeves’s corruption → choosing to expose it while masking her findings on the radio. The single-scene structure with light embedded backstory supports a clear build to a decisive change in Elena’s stance toward Reeves. Closure lands via a concrete action (evidence distributed, call for a team) and a reconfigured status quo with visible implied cost (professional and personal risk). A hair more on-page reaction from Reeves or institutional response could heighten the sense of immediate peril.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is elegant and legible: Marcus arrives with the heart → reveals the prior second opinion and letter → this reframes Eliana’s earlier judgment → she chooses to attempt restoration with a new purpose for the heart. The scene is well-contained in one location and time-window, with backstory woven in cleanly and anchored by concrete triggers (the box, the letter). Closure lands via both a decisive change (the commitment to repair and donate) and a conceptual repricing of what “beyond repair” means. The only limitation is that the stakes and costs remain relatively quiet and interior, never quite pushed to a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: experiment → strengthening signal → pattern breakthrough → decision to depart. The story lands a coherent closure beat (she redirects the workshop and departs toward the bell), which reads as a decisive change in her situation and options. The drive is mostly conceptual/epistemic, but the structure supports that, with each recalibration tightening focus on the unknown signal. The main limitation is that the cost at closure is only lightly sketched, so the before/after hinge is more intellectual than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a tight investigative arc: anomalies → pattern → encrypted directory → revelation → choice, with clear because/therefore linkages. The closure unit (her decision to join the vanished rather than expose them) lands cleanly with conceptual and implied existential cost. Structure is linear and coherent, though the memetic hazard concept is accepted quickly and mostly via exposition, without a complicating beat that might test her resolve. Still, for this length, the single tightening (discovering Folder 1408 and its implications) is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-time problem → new method via mirrors → emotional back-history glimpsed → reconfigured purpose and plan, with clear causal links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines the “crystal’s” function from prediction to revealing hinge-moments of choice, and leaves with a concrete intention for the feuding families. The cost—carrying altered shadows, committing to deeper mediation—is conceptually legible but not sharply foregrounded as a sacrifice, and the resolution of the Voss/Henriksen feud is left offstage. Still, orientation is excellent and there are no causality breaks, just a preference for insight over dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival and volunteering, the supply run as pivotal middle beat, then a compressed seasonal montage leading to the decision to stay, all under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is coherent—her altered perception leads her north, volunteering aligns her with endings, the trip with Henriksen clarifies her understanding, and she then forgoes the scheduled consultation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, but the before/after is legible with conceptual cost. The time jump over summer/autumn is handled efficiently, though the external stakes remain fairly low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one night, one meeting, a single conversation that pivots around the letter and the vineyard analogy. Causality is clear—his invitation leads to confrontation over the letter and a reframing of their history, resolving in a quiet earned stasis as they take the bus together but apart. Closure is solid: their stance toward their past decisively changes without soft-resetting the impossibility of being together. The drive feels mostly situational with a mild accumulative texture from the repeated vineyard parallels, and that coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—prophet’s death → fading clearings → request for help → Senna’s consecration—is clean, with one coherent scene building to a clear closure beat. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but the consecration provides a legible on-page reconfiguration with future obligations implied. Stakes remain modestly scaled and somewhat abstract, but the structural arc is tidy and complete. No major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous gathering that moves from arrival through ritual to a quiet reconfiguration at dusk. Causality is straightforward—Margot’s arrival and tools lead to communal drawing, which leads to a reframed relationship with the ruins—and orientation is excellent from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the factory shifts from symbol of loss to witness of new beginnings. The main limitation is that the shift feels gentle and foregone rather than pressured, so the sense of paid cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from summons → experiment with the crystal → realization about linguistic evolution → decision about how she’ll testify. Causality holds and closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the nature of “language collapse” is redefined. The cost of her choice (what it will mean to face the Council with an unsettling answer) is implied more than dramatized, and pressure never quite tightens into a sharp beat, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear and disciplined: present action in the garden interleaves with the logic of his curse, the driftwood compass, and the chalk-writing, all converging on the realization of what “the sound of growing older” really is. Causality is clean at this scale—he comes because of a future loss, writes as the memories slip, and ends with a reweighting of his project rather than a mechanical twist. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final seashell image reframes all prior images of fog, tapes, and driftwood as one captured-but-imperfect sound. The scene is continuous and well anchored; the only minor limitation is that the forward beat (“locate something he’d lost three days from now”) resolves more conceptually than in a felt, scene-bound decision.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: tremors and anomalous instruments → observation of the moon → realization of accelerating orbital decay → decision to restructure the array → charged final image of bearing witness as the moon departs. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous scene with a single, clear turn when Kenji stops opposing the motion and retools around it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis with an undeniable conceptual cost: humanity is losing its moon, and the best available response is to witness rather than prevent. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: prognosis and time limit → Maya’s musical/emotional intervention → the letter → Rebecca’s arrival and reconciliation → death and memorial. Time jumps (thirty hours later; three days later) are clear and feel purposeful rather than hand-wavy. Closure is solidly on the page, with the reconciliation and death reconfiguring the initial problem of estrangement. The one notable elision—skipping the actual dialogue of reconciliation—keeps it from feeling fully maximal but doesn’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: key discovery → recognition of patterns in the journal → key in orrery → misfire → reinterpretation → realignment → new noon phenomenon. The story delivers a clear before/after: a world trapped in night and shadow-loss vs. an observatory and cosmos that “remember” their cycle. Cost is mild and largely conceptual (a reconfigured reality, the key sacrificed to the mechanism), so the closure is satisfying but not searing. Structure is tight and coherent for the length, with no serious orientation or drive issues.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the failed substitute body shatters certainty, sending Marianne into the maze, which reveals the garden, the tooth, Iris, and finally the offer to "begin the work." The piece operates under a causal lens with a strong conceptual-repricing closure: Marianne renounces the comfort of false certainty and commits to a new, costly vocation. Stakes (truth about Iris, possibility of bringing other children home) escalate logically without contrivance, and the final choice clearly reconfigures options for the future. The only minor limitation is that the mechanics of "bridging the gap" remain abstract, making the practical cost more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-moment scene framed by a well-anchored reflective history of the fire and Elena, all clearly situated in the grotto at dawn. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, with pressure deepening as backstory reweights her current acts of polishing and arranging glass. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the cave becomes a “serpentine cathedral” where her grief is repurposed into ongoing, gentle instruction and the final image of the smiling child in colored shadow feels earned. The cost—her irrevocable loss and renunciation of former life—is implied rather than dramatized in the final beat, which keeps this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense sanctuary scene interleaved with just enough backstory about the confession to orient stakes. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: confession → retreat to data center → pattern-gathering → Chen’s arrival with notebook → reconfiguration of Maya’s understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and the before/after is legible. A slightly sharper on-page beat where Maya’s options feel more pinched (e.g., rejecting vs. accepting the notebook) could heighten the sense of structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: shell → apparitions → catalog of “shapes of hope” → reframed understanding of the protagonist → decision to go home and write. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—endings redefined as expressions of hope under pressure, not binary verdicts. The causal throughline (her ritual visit produces choices that resolve the block) holds, and the cost of her new stance is legible in the commitment to “move against the current of forgetting.” It’s a quiet but fully legible closure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: setup of the rare celestial alignment and contraption, execution of the ritual, visible transformation of the arbor/land, then a forward-looking decision about sharing the songs. Causality is solid under a primarily causal lens: notebooks → machine → moon alignment → music → growth → plan to revive the practices. Closure lands via a decisive change (the ritual succeeds) and Cassian’s choice to disseminate the songs, though the cost is mostly implied (years of work, social risk) rather than sharply felt in the final beat. The piece is well-shaped but lacks a complicating turn or obstacle that would intensify the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: careful setup of the ritual, activation during the aurora, then the gathering and sealing of the maps. Causality is coherent—her years of preparation with flash-paper lead to this specific night, the aurora enables the recording, and that result motivates the final act of preservation. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s doomed stasis is reframed as remembered possibility through the stored maps. The cost—years of labor and the acceptance that she cannot save the trees, only their longing—is legible, though kept at a conceptual rather than dramatized crisis pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the device → observation of light/reflections → reconstruction → activation → communal witnessing, with no major logic gaps. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the cavern’s echoes reframe their survival as part of a longer lineage. Orientation is solid from early on (who/where/why in the cave), and the structure holds as a single through-line of investigation. The main limitation is that the broader survival stakes stay mostly off-stage, so the climax feels thematically, not situationally, decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the grotto → ongoing compulsion → successive burdens calcifying → mandala complete → realization and exit. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, and the closure unit—a resonant reconfiguration in which she reframes being trapped into being the necessary container—lands with conceptual cost (three seasons of entrapment, leaving the crystals behind). The pattern of burdens forming a mandala around the lamp is a satisfying tightening that points directly to the ending. The only limitation is that escalation remains mostly tonal rather than forcing a more acute final dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure—a single continuous scene bracketed by the kettle’s progress—anchors time and delivers a clean accumulative build. Backstory via the journals is tightly integrated and shifts her understanding in the present rather than stalling it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: by choosing and finishing the bowl, she redefines what “here and gone” means for her and Roland. The cost is implicit but legible: she forecloses the fantasy of Roland’s untouched potential in favor of her own imperfect act.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-moment observation → contextualizing reflection → tightening as the ghost approaches → decisive internal shift. Causality is more emotional than logistical but coherent: carousel stops → world and self fragment → she clings to fragments → confrontation with her own ghost forces a stance. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change/earned stasis hybrid when she drops the wheel and accepts reintegration. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues, though pressure is mostly internal and could be sharpened marginally.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: survey → noticing patterns → blueprint analysis → conceptual breakthrough → night drafting → dawn email forms a coherent causal arc. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the closure beat—sending the proposal while the spaceport “waits” between fall and rise—reads as a clear Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. The drive lens feels Hybrid (causal progression plus accumulative imagery), held consistently. The main limitation is that plot pressure remains low-stakes on the page, with no on-scene resistance or complication beyond the signed demolition contract being mentioned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: walk to sanctuary → confrontation with buried designs → interaction with crystals → new decision, all under a single causal lens. Orientation is immediate and stable; the magical element of the crystals is introduced early and paid off without breaking logic. Closure is decisive and on-page: she reframes the purpose of her resignation and commits to a risky new path, with explicit social and economic costs gestured at. The arc is quiet but cohesive, with no dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from quiet set-up through the activation of the sundial to conceptual revelation and a calm closure. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her actions (rotating the sundial, documenting) steadily deepen the same line of discovery. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Viktor’s work and her own failures, with a clear before/after in how she will approach “voids” versus monuments. The main limitation is that pressure never tightens into a real dilemma, so the turn reads as deepening understanding rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean and linear: Mira examines the rope, discovers nested objects, understands their meaning, and then deliberately restores the rope, with each discovery causally linked to the last. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her role as custodian is crystallized. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—the weight of inherited knowledge—yet it is legible in the final image of her alone in the fog, “holding rope that held memory.” What keeps this from the highest band is that no beat truly constrains options or forces a hard choice; the piece never risks structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from arrival to confrontation to a quiet but definite reconfiguration. Under an accumulative/situational lens, the main tightening is Maren’s “What if you stopped explaining?” which credibly triggers the Duchess’s release and a new stance toward her own “death.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the obituary reframed as intermission and “mapping her own returning,” with a felt emotional cost. The conflict arc is modest and interior, but causality holds and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line is clean: prince retrieves egg → they build the incubator → the egg hatches into something unexpected, leading to a conceptual shift about beauty and technology. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and the palace’s shaking plus drilling tighten the frame as dawn approaches. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the emergence of a hybrid phoenix redefines what “reawakening beauty” can mean, with a felt cost (no return to purity). The only ceiling is that external complications are relatively mild; success arrives somewhat smoothly once the egg is in place.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: present-time ritual framed by tightly linked backstory, all in one continuous scene, with clear orientation and a legible before/after. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story escalates through deepening symbols (lagoon, sand, coin) rather than reversals, culminating in Elena’s conceptual turn when she “hears” her scars sing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (Maya’s refusal of the radio call in favor of this healing, Elena’s new stance toward her scars). The only limitation is relatively low external pressure, so the arc feels more inevitable than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: breadcrumbs → courtyard → box → code → release, with no serious orientation issues and a clear before/after at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city “remembers itself,” and Mira’s stance toward mystery shifts in a legible way. However, the pressure from one beat to the next is gentle; nothing meaningfully threatens to derail her progress, so the turns read more like steps in a ritual than contested stages. It’s strong, publishable structure, but not yet maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is straightforward and coherent: Keeper searches → finds pod → offers help → restores light and departs, with a clear before/after in the family’s survival. The closure image (gear tumbling, Keeper moving on) provides a satisfying conceptual repricing around patterns and illumination. The drive lens reads as largely causal with an accumulative thematic overlay and holds cleanly to the end. The main weakness is how smoothly the external rescue arrives, leaving the conflict resolved with minimal visible cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear: arrival → ghost encounter → guided reevaluation via the ribbon → reframe of her work → farewell and new commitment. Causality holds, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of what monuments and family poems mean—lands cleanly with cost in Marcus’s final fading and her new, heavier responsibility. The drive is largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the single greenhouse scene plus the migration-span ellipsis feels coherent. The only soft spot is that on-page stakes never quite tighten beyond dialogue and realization, so the turn is more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a clean causal throughline (guilt → years of precision → deliberate stop → engraving → release) and lands a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The single-scene structure is coherent and the before/after—secret-keeping vs inscribed truth—reads clearly with emotional cost. It is, however, a quiet, mostly interior progression with only one major turn, so escalation in terms of options narrowing feels modest rather than striking.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: loss at the tournament → drive past cemetery/silo → decision to work in the silo → alignment of tapestry and letter → realization about misrecorded lives → resolve to act. The story reads under a causal lens with an internal RR closure, and the final decision to visit the seven graves tomorrow is a legible before/after. Stakes are modestly scaled but consistent, and there are no orientation or logic slips. The cost—accepting a new responsibility for the dead’s stories—is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: approach → ascent → poised pre-writing beat → extended writing sequence → descent with completed vellum, all causally linked. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal plus conceptual): her decision to write via predictive models leads to an outcome that conceptually reconfigures the future (Councils of Unknowing). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the future is framed as possibility constrained by acknowledged ignorance, and that before/after is legible. The main limitation is that the on-page cost at closure is modest—more toil and resolve than a sharp irreversible loss—so the structural arc never tightens to a truly gripping pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: waiting → broadcast arrival → luminous revelation → comprehension of the method → decision to spread it, with each beat logically building on the last. The chosen drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the closure—her resolved stance to end the story famine via dust—is legible and satisfying. Causality holds throughout (no broken rules or teleporting logic), and the orientation is strong from the first paragraph. What keeps this below the top band is the relative lack of on-page resistance or complication; the discovery arc unfolds almost frictionlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the rocking chair stops → discovery of the mask → altered perception of the gallery → ash-message transformation → revised commitment to her work. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she will continue the same external job but with reweighted meaning and a visible conceptual cost (loss of “safety” in preservation). Causality and temporal flow are clear, and the quiet scale suits the piece, though stakes remain largely internal and philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter with clear orientation and a tight causal line from Karin’s arrival → ideological argument → Marcus’s reframed decision. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he refuses factional narratives but commits to a preservation network, reconfiguring his role while paying the cost of continued marginalization. The causal stakes are largely conceptual rather than practical, which keeps this out of the very top band but still highly functional.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from Mrs. Chen’s loss and retreat into the library to her experimental “non-choir” and the culminating humming exercise. Causality is coherent—her history and the town’s fracture motivate her quietly radical choice to gather these specific people and lead them through harmony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of the rosette plus the imperfect chord reweights the situation from elegy to a fragile, earned continuity. The main limitation is that the central “turn” is more described than dramatized; the move from discord to harmony is smooth but not especially pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: grandmother’s charge → long delay until alignment → planting → rapid growth → quiet dissemination → movement spread. Structure is essentially single-threaded with a time-lapse middle, and the ending image of the girl provides a clear resonant reconfiguration. However, key developments (authorities noticing, seeds spreading) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens closure cost. The alignment as a time pressure is underused past the inciting act, making the global drive feel slightly under-tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: blackout → tower meeting → confession about the drones hoarding energy → new “wonderful” redesigns and a shared plan. The story fits a single-scene, causal model with a Conceptual Repricing closure: the cause of the blackout redefines what “progress” means. The cost (Chen’s culpability, Mira’s duty to expose him, the danger of redesigning the system) is legible though understated. Structural weakness: much of the middle is expository explanation of the failure rather than dramatized complication, which slightly flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as one accumulating scene with a brief, well-anchored backstory inset, moving from beach to Kettering house to realization. Causality is clear in an accumulative/textural way: collecting → arranging → hush → house “exhale” → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (what houses “need”), but the cost is more implied than sharply felt, which keeps it below top-tier. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, with no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the ampoule → psychic contact → revelation of the city’s true history → Marina’s ethical choice → statue’s release. Backstory is interleaved with present-moment cues (the ampoule, the garden) and directly shifts Marina’s options and stance rather than pausing the scene. Closure is a decisive change (her commitment to testify) and a conceptual repricing of the “tragedy” narrative, with the cost of social upheaval and the statue’s death. The only small weakness is that the surface-world stakes are gestured at rather than concretely dramatized, softening the felt magnitude of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: abandoning the research → life of compromise → dream-space staircase embodying perpetual motion → confrontation with Castellano → sideways step → waking to proofs and unsent email → decisive send. The infinite staircase functions as a situational pressure cooker that coherently forces a stance, and the sideways step is a clear on-page Decisive Change that reconfigures her options. The cost—risking catastrophic failure and the comfortable safety of her current life—is legible in the final hesitation over the send button. Structure (one surreal scene framed by office reality) is elegant and easy to follow without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: painting strokes → daydreams → a complete phrase → emotional closure, all under a single night’s frame. Causality holds under the textural lens: each stroke/vision deepens her evidence and narrows her emotional options until rest becomes viable. The closure—she has proved to herself that kindness is remembered and allows herself to sleep—is legible and paid for by the preceding insomnia and effort. It’s strong but not formally daring; escalation is mainly in density rather than any sharp structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: beekeeper dies → waterfall freezes → city is trapped → arts decay → Celeste finds lens and uses it to reveal fractures → community organizes to thaw. Structure is linear and coherent with one main tightening when the fractures are revealed and people gather at the wall. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: options have changed, and the cost (deaths, dwindling supplies, labor) is legible. Escalation is more conceptual than event-driven, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: hunger stone appears with the low tide → Maren, prepared by months of reverse-engineering, uses this temporal “thin moment” to activate the yoyo → reality reconfigures and she crosses the threshold. Orientation is strong and early; the lighthouse, shore, and hunger stone are all legible, and the single-scene structure supports a tight arc. Closure delivers a decisive change (Maren vanishes into a new regime of causality) and a conceptual repricing of the hunger stone’s warning, with on-page cost (her departure, the cracked stone). A slightly sharper on-page articulation of what’s at stake for the larger world would push the structure even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: resurrection → curse → visit to advisor → paradoxical guidance → confession in mirrors → fear’s manifestation → entrapment in the clasp. Single-scene continuity is strong and orientation is clear from the start, with no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as a decisive change—fear is materially constrained and Margot’s stance toward her curse is reconfigured—with a legible before/after. The dream dictionary’s role in the final turn is slightly underdeveloped, reading more as interpretive support than a true structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ominous clouds → instrumental consultation of the leeward currents → counterintuitive anchor adjustment → near-miss with the vortex. The story holds a single scene and stake with a credible ticking clock and no orientation issues. Closure is solidly on the page, though the survival beat is relatively smooth—there’s no moment where the plan plausibly might fail or needs adaptation. The cost of success lands more conceptually than viscerally, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: rusted gate → immobility → shell language disruption → widening crack → whistle as navigation key → turtle movement → decision to confront the Council. Structure is a single, continuous scene with well-integrated backstory that always orients around the current problem. Closure lands as a conceptual and practical turn: Maren reinterprets the watchers and commits to breaking civic “certainty,” with the turtle’s movement as on-page proof and cost-laden new trajectory. Escalation could be slightly sharper if one more concrete obstacle or pushback appeared on the page rather than being summarized (Council’s dismissal is offstage).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: years-long quest → arrival at station as deadline → confrontation with Hawthorne → access to the letter → decision to present it publicly, satisfying closure via a decisive change in options and knowledge. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a light preamble; orientation is clear early. The cost is implied (destabilizing national myth, potential backlash) rather than dramatized, which keeps the climax conceptually tidy but emotionally slightly safe. Within this scope, the global drive and closure are coherent and fully legible, just not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single underwater survey session that escalates from routine note-placing to the charged discovery of the unsent letters. Causality is solid—his work on a crack leads directly to uncovering the box, which reconfigures his mission from abstract remembrance to specific lives. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses witnessing and research over exposing or “rescuing” the letters, and the final return-to-ritual image is clearly reweighted. The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens, and that through-line holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: blackout → forced analog work → discovery of the stamp → retrieval of the journal → pattern recognition → renewed mission. Causality is tight and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of her purpose via the stamp and the underground press. The only limit is the relatively soft sense of cost and consequence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece runs as a single continuous scene with embedded reflection, cleanly oriented in place, time, and goal by the first few paragraphs. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of “Transform, polish, fold, release” and the counting of cranes build toward a resonant, charged-stasis ending. Causality is coherent (shadow detaches → she seeks illicit technique → she executes her thousand-crane plan), though there is no major mid-story reversal or new obstacle. Closure lands as a deepened commitment to an impossible task with felt cost, rather than a decisive external change.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs as a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory, oriented cleanly in time and space, and it maintains an Accumulative/Textural drive rather than a strongly causal one. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by the end, Mira’s ongoing “hunt” is reframed as her awakened way of being, with the circuit breakers’ readiness echoing her own. There is no major plot turn, but the anomaly detection and thruster adjustment provide a modest tightening that justifies the final charged poise. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than event-based, but it’s legible in her acceptance of a life lived in that liminal search.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: pilgrim arrives → reveals chip and myth → Mara integrates it into her system → star trails appear → Mara commits to the quest, producing a resonant internal reconfiguration. The single-scene structure is tight and orientation is excellent (who/where/when is clear almost immediately). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: Mara’s self-concept flips from “missing piece” to “finder of pieces” with the new global task set in motion. What holds this out of higher bands is the lack of a concrete on-page obstacle or cost test; everything comes rather smoothly once the premise is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine—from Mara’s past decision, to years of guilt, to the watch hand, then Elias’s confrontation and her decision to stop—is clean and legible. Backstory is front-loaded but anchored to her present ritual and clearly drives the present stakes. Closure lands as an on-page decisive change (she will dismantle the lies) with a clear cost. The scene could benefit from one additional present-tense complication or hesitation to deepen the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single negotiation scene with clear anchors (who/where/when) and a causal throughline from setup (moon-phase method) to closure (simultaneous crossing). The global drive is largely situational—pressure of mistrust and timing—supported by simple because/therefore links. Closure (the exchange succeeds; Katrin returns to her ongoing work) is legible, but the cost is subdued, since no serious on-page threat or near-failure moment tests the design. Everything functions smoothly without surprising structural risk.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: anchored quickly at the kayak launch, then a causal chain from past failure → present request → refusal → acceptance → launch. The reflection on the Mariner’s Quest is well-placed and directly reorients her decision in the present, staying within BRR allowances. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina shifts from avoidance to actively navigating with a new philosophy (“use more than one system”), and the open water final image makes the before/after legible with cost. No major causality or lens slips; this reads as a tight causal piece.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal arc: procedure → classified ad → journey → meeting the Interpreter → receiving the baseball → reframing his quest, with no orientation issues. Closure is a decisive internal change (he abandons the fantasy that remembering or forgetting is the solution and commits to choice), and the before/after is legible with some cost (living without the certainty he sought). The time traveler anecdote is integrated but delivered as a compact exposition block, which slightly flattens live scene pressure. Overall structure is solid and immediately publishable but not yet exceptional in intricacy or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single causal chain from fortune → loss of Tam → decision to perform the spice ritual → metamorphosis and new state. The drive lens is primarily causal with lyric texture, and the closure delivers a decisive change with a clear before/after and on-page cost. Orientation is immediate and consistent; no world rule contradicts itself. The only soft spot is how smoothly the ritual succeeds, with little sense of risk that it might fail or misfire.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: she ascends to repay time, performs the ritual, receives progressively more damning visions, and chooses to abandon the glade for her daughter. Closure is clear and earned: a decisive change with visible cost (foreclosing her pattern of time-theft and the allure of this exalted space). Structure is simple but effective—one continuous arc with no orientation issues and no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: orientation lands quickly, the experiment setup builds logically from Mei’s work, and the activation of the apparatus functions as a clear climactic beat with on-page closure as the dimension begins to open. Causality is solid—her research leads to the device, which leads to the resonance and the opening—but the cost of this act is largely gestured at rather than sharply dramatized. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise rather than a decisive change with fully felt consequences, which is appropriate but keeps it just short of elite. No orientation or lens ambiguity penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, structure is clean: one continuous scene with backstory woven in, oriented early, and building toward a quiet conceptual turn. The causal chain is modest but intact—detour → being on that beach during the alignment → encounter with the surveyor → release of all the bugs → reframing of her role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she explicitly names a new identity and path, with the loss of her jars as the visible cost. Stakes remain mostly interior and low-simmer, so the arc feels more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → Maren enacts prepared plan → Voss confirms collusion → sundial becomes active map → distribution begins. The piece uses a straightforward single-scene structure with a clear inciting event and a closure beat where the revolution’s ignition is crystallized. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the fort’s role and Maren’s are redefined, though no decisive on-page confrontation occurs. The main limitation is that the “revolution” remains entirely preparatory; no present-tense choice forces a sacrifice beyond what’s already long decided.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one scene, one drive (complete the sequence to get an answer), and a coherent buildup to a conceptual-repricing closure when she places the seventeenth stone. Causality holds—dust draws eels, rocks encode pattern, pattern triggers revelation and eel-song—under an accumulative/textural lens. The choice of completion never feels in doubt, so the turns are more about deepening understanding than narrowing options, which limits tension but not coherence. The closure unit is on-page and legible with a clear before/after in her understanding of friction’s disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single night vigil framed against the three-month aftermath of the incident, with backstory economically woven into the ongoing watch-write-breathe ritual. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of timed cycles and the storm’s movement east culminate in a quiet but clear closure (charged poise / earned stasis: she recommits to documenting and disseminating). Causality is coherent and stakes carry through; orientation (who/where/when) is immediate. The only minor limitation is that the closure is more lyrical reaffirmation than a sharp new turn, so before/after is subtly rather than decisively marked.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with clear orientation and a causal throughline from duel challenge → delay → shared decoding → reconfigured relationship. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they consciously replace immediate violence with an ongoing intellectual duel, with implied social and ego costs. However, once Harwick lowers his blade, the external pressure slackens and never meaningfully resurges; the duel stake dissolves rather than tightening. The puzzle’s solution functions more as collaboration than a hard turn with constrained options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory, anchored clearly in time and place, building from discovery of the seeds to a decision to weaponize beauty. Causality is solid—finding the tin leads to the expanded plan (“Not just here. Everywhere…”), which reconfigures the meaning of their ongoing visits. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of future selves returning to a blooming library conceptually reprices her fragmentation and their ritual. Stakes are modest but coherent, and no set-up is left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: her decision to splice the film and play the score triggers the compass synchronization, temporal distortion, clock reversal, and her husband’s return. The story holds a single continuous scene with a few embedded memories; orientation and world rules are clear enough and consistent within this fantastical logic. Closure is decisive and on-page: the before/after of her twenty-year waiting versus renewed arrival is unmistakable, with the clock’s reversal as a concrete pivot. The only limiting factor is how smoothly and completely the experiment succeeds on the first attempt, with little sense of risk or partial failure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-tense decision framed by backstory (the dream tests), a ticking monsoon clock, and a single culminating action of planting the seed. Causality holds: dreams → increased doubt/hope → deadline pressure → decision to plant with known risks. Closure is a Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing of her job’s mandate; the cost (possibly losing the seed forever) is legible. Escalation is mostly internal and could be sharpened slightly, but it remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene on the islet in which the box, compass, lace, and bonsai lesson causally progress toward Mira’s reframed understanding. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and that pattern holds; each object and explanation adds weight until the conceptual turn that the compass is not for finding north but what was lost, and the lace is about how to tend what remains. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira recognizes the true nature of her inheritance and the story forecloses the fantasy of recovering the past in favor of cultivating the present. Cost is present but quiet—the acceptance that lost relationships and silence cannot be undone, only honored through care.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the wreckage from a site of loss to a site of "transformation observed patiently." The drive lens (Hybrid: Accumulative/Causal) holds perfectly, with the physical sorting of scales causing the thematic epiphany. Pacing is controlled and the "wreck" vs. "order" constraint shapes the protagonist's tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    A severe causal ellipsis undermines the climax; the narrative jumps from a gunpoint standoff to the antagonist being bound and led away without showing the turning point. This "soft reset" resolves the central physical conflict in the white space between paragraphs, robbing the story of its decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure violates the short-story scope by relying on an iterative montage ("most afternoons," "As winter deepened") instead of a singular, causal scene. This "synopsis mode" flattens the dramatic arc, as events merely happen in sequence without a tight because/therefore chain driven by immediate urgency. Closure arrives, but it feels like the end of a summary rather than the resolution of a specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary to bypass the story's most critical moments, particularly the climax ("He worked for days or hours"). While the dream-to-reality transitions work well for a fable, the lack of a dramatized confrontation or complex obstacle during the restoration phase flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure relies heavily on iterative summary in the first half ("She began... Each week..."), which flattens the inciting pressure. Closure is distinct and legible, but the buildup lacks a specific, grounded scene to drive the change.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    A clean, linear arc leads to a legible closure (the offering), though the progression lacks causal friction; the protagonist moves from question to answer without significant obstacles or error.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative creates a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, recontextualizing the protagonist's trap as a navigable geometry. The cause-and-effect flow from the catalyst (fragment) to the climax (disintegration) is clear, though the pacing of the realization is rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    The puzzle mechanics are physically vague; loose keys on a floor "pointing" to distant architectural features strains verisimilitude. The discovery of the handcuff key within the pile is a convenient coincidence that resolves the scene's primary physical constraint without a dedicated cost or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is taut and functionally perfect for this length, moving from a distinct desire to a competence-driven crisis and a resonant decisive change. The closure—destroying the device to accept the silence—reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the central stake with palpable cost. Causality holds strictly under the story's speculative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure via a Conceptual Repricing, but the pivot relies heavily on a "magic explanation" delivered by Celeste in dialogue. The causality is external (the moonbeams showed me, Celeste explained it) rather than driven by the protagonist's active pressure on the situation. The ending is legible but feels like a fable's moral rather than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is competent, following a clear situational lens from work to realization. Closure takes the valid form of a Decisive Change (the decision to visit the sister). However, the causality is soft; the transition from "holding on" to "letting go" happens with philosophical ease rather than the friction of genuine struggle, making the resolution feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot pivots on a phone call where the antagonist explains the entire twist via exposition ("I encrypted the truth..."), which deflates tension. The pivotal decoding moment is rushed with a convenient "suddenly" realization rather than a process of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is solid, following a clear linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure (learning to navigate by absence). The drive lens (Conceptual/Situational) holds steady, and the ending recontextualizes the fort's situation effectively. The pacing aligns well with the dimming star.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative structure is functional, but the middle section relies on heavy exposition from Dr. Yemeni to bridge the gap between action and understanding. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the "explanation" feel of the dialogue undercuts the dramatic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear Decisive Change (the relationship shift). However, the central causal mechanic—using a projector lens to overlap doodles and find hidden meanings—strains credibility as a deliberate communication strategy by a "cowardly" character. It operates on poetic logic rather than strict causality, which softens the plot's backbone.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the maze opening for the dresser provides physical proof that reweights the concept of "luck." The Accumulative structure—layering the marble stories—builds the necessary pressure to make the supernatural ending feel earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of competence without significant obstacles. The closure offers "lightness of vindication" rather than a felt cost; while the conceptual repricing (time is non-linear) is present, the emotional reaction undermines its weight, resulting in an "easy win" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mystery resolution relies on magical convenience (water stains forming words) rather than deduction, removing protagonist agency. The closure is a promise of future action ("Tomorrow she would") rather than an on-page decisive change with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing (accepting uncertainty), but the narrative arc lacks friction; the solution is implemented without obstacle or failure. The fever functions as a plot device to deliver the insight rather than a pressure that complicates the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent, but the closure—resolving a generational haunting by simply turning a valve—feels mechanical and unearned. The ending releases thematic pressure but lacks a visible cost or consequence for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary for the first half, condensing "untold seasons" rather than grounding the reader in a specific scene early on. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, the delayed inciting incident weakens the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent but lacks a "felt cost" or decisive turning point; the resolution (Thomas speaking) arrives as a gift of the setting rather than a hard-won consequence of choice. The closure is a "pure win" without the necessary sacrifice or trade-off to satisfy the rubric’s requirement for high-stakes literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence: finding the exact diary describing the exact tapestry fragment in a random donation box. This unearned connection resolves the narrative inquiry instantly without intellectual labor or cost. The closure is a serene affirmation of the status quo rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    The structure is procedural and linear—problem, solution, success—without a meaningful tightening of options or a reversal. The closure provides symmetric satisfaction (mission accomplished) but lacks the required legible cost (felt or conceptual) to reconfigure the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Conceptual Repricing" arc where a theological argument defeats the antagonist. However, the resolution feels somewhat effortless; the protagonist achieves a total victory without paying the "visible or felt cost" required by the rubric for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure follows a clean "Conceptual Repricing" arc, where the protagonist reinterprets her role (prediction to translation). Orientation is excellent, anchoring the reader immediately in the spire and lake. The causality is internal but legible; the visual stimulus (horizon) credibly triggers the memory that solves the central problem.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is strong, delivering a Decisive Change with visible, felt cost (weight, ache) that clearly resolves the premise. However, the bridge to resolution relies on a compressed summary of timelines that bypasses immediate causal struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative spans months through summary and time-skips, violating the short story's need for scene-based immediacy. The causal link between the broken needle and the specific discovery (playing audio backward) relies on metaphorical convenience rather than narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is solid, moving efficiently from the inciting object to the meeting and resolution. Closure lands clearly with a "Conceptual Repricing" as Marianne views the world through a new lens. The arrival of the woman immediately after the note is read feels slightly convenient ("as if summoned"), and the lack of obstacles during the conversation makes the plot feel linear and transactional.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and decisive, moving efficiently from the inciting invitation to the climactic revelation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's relationship to her grief is fundamentally altered by the event.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is legible and coherent under an accumulative lens, but the narrative arc is linear and lacks causal friction. The resolution relies on a convenient apparition to confirm the protagonist's thoughts rather than a dramatic turn earned by action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, successfully building atmospheric pressure to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The shift from the "chronic hush" to the "living quiet" is earned through the ritual action, though the progression is gentle and lacks a sharp, decisive causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where the sensory experience of the amber directly triggers the climax. The closure is a quintessential Conceptual Repricing: Mara redefines the value of the "half-truth" not as a lie, but as a bridge to hope. The cost is subtle but distinct—the sacrifice of her trademark perfection for a riskier, deeper honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary ("Over the following weeks") exactly where the relationship and project should be tested, destroying scene-level tension. The ending relies on a retrospective success montage rather than a dramatized closure unit with felt cost; the "shift" is an unearned realization following a series of uncomplicated victories.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The inciting incident and climax are distinct, but the plot relies on a "POV cheat" where the narrative withholds the protagonist's knowledge (that she is the artist) to manufacture mystery. This artificial suspense creates a causality gap, as her actions during the search read as performative without the narrative acknowledging the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to resolution, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the established costs (temporal scars, spent power) are explicitly dismissed as temporary. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction (goal achieved, world healed) rather than a reconfiguration with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist accepts the "unsolvable" nature of her loss with a felt shift in perspective. The causal chain from the discovery of the prime numbers to the ritual and final vision is consistent and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story begins as a grounded scene but dissolves into narrative summary ("Over the following weeks") to reach closure, diffusing the tension established in the opening. This shift from dramatic present to montage weakens the structural integrity and distances the reader from the final emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece functions effectively as a contemplative vignette, and the closure (releasing the leaf) creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the structure leans excessively on backstory and reflection (exceeding the 30% soft cap for reflection-led modes) to explain the stakes, rather than dramatizing the conflict through immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens where the encounter with Marcus leads directly to the protagonist's action and subsequent realization. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration; however, the "exchange" promised by the dialogue lacks a visceral, felt cost on the page—she gains wisdom primarily through compliance with the instructions rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving from confident mastery to total destabilization in a single scene. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to reality is fundamentally altered.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and linear, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the narrative path is frictionless; the "staggered intervals" method manages the scene too easily, and the resolution (Thomas accepting the valve) feels inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively as Mara accepts her new role. However, the progression relies on dream-logic transitions where obstacles dissolve easily, reducing the sense of causal weight or orientation in the final fortress sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Hybrid arc leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts her role. However, the causality is largely external—the magic happens to her—rather than being triggered by a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight, using the storm and fragment to force a decisive climax. Closure is strong, offering a distinct conceptual repricing where Cassius moves from boredom to obsessive determination.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vincent is forced into rehabilitation—lands with undeniable cost (loss of freedom/money). The retrospective reveal ("I told him everything an hour ago") is handled efficiently, anchoring the present confrontation in a decisive prior action that forecloses Vincent's escape.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is executed with precision, teaching the logic of the lamps ("minor third," "perfect fifth") before using it to frame the climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's life work. A slight timeline ambiguity in the opening paragraph (the shop closing long ago vs. the town going silent "just as" she arrived) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with the poison label serving as a distinct pivot point that shifts the story from static survival to active investigation. The climax relies slightly on situational convenience—the harbormaster finding her—rather than her actively seeking the confrontation, which holds this back from the highest band. However, the resolution (Closure via Resonant Reconfiguration) is earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, legible arc of realization (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the causality is soft; the protagonist changes her mind because the magic literally works, bypassing the need for a difficult internal choice. While the closure is distinct, the transition from "evidence" to "connection" relies on the supernatural element providing the answer rather than the character earning the insight through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story relies heavily on exposition and summary to bridge the gap between the inciting incident (developers) and the resolution (successful resistance). The middle section ("Within weeks...") summarizes the conflict rather than dramatizing it in a scene, violating the rubric's preference for scenic causality and reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure creates effective pressure through the demolition countdown. However, the discovery of microscopic text on the sand grain acts as a thematic shortcut—a coincidence of light and angle that resolves the internal arc too conveniently. The closure is resonant, with the photo capturing the destruction effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative functions as a low-tension vignette rather than a story with a decisive turn; the problem is introduced and resolved via competence without complication. Closure acts as simple stasis—the job is done, and she returns to work—lacking the "felt cost" or "resonant reconfiguration" required for higher bands. The mechanism of reading light refraction through water tactilely strains plausibility without establishing a clear rule-set early on.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible and the closure (departure to the ice) qualifies as a Decisive Change. However, the total lack of obstacles—the colleague agrees instantly, the data aligns perfectly—lowers the narrative pressure significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The framing of the "collapse that never came" offers a strong structural container that recontextualizes the events. However, the internal narrative is linear and lacks causal tightening; the transition from skepticism to communal harmony is smoothed over rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a logical progression through the rescue. Closure is effective—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the artifact is kept but contained ("locked away"), creating a lingering cost of carrying dangerous knowledge without using it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain: arrival, investigation via the lattice key, discovery, and decision under pressure. The closure (stepping into the hush) is a Decisive Change that effectively recontextualizes the "cry wolf" premise into a new reality. The pacing is tight, using the Warden's deadline to force the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" structure where the solution is handed to the protagonist instantly. The resolution acts as a soft reset—burying a bead instantly reverses three centuries of magical consequences without requiring ingenuity, sacrifice, or complication from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each subsequent night," "By the third week") rather than dramatized scenes, which smooths over the causal friction of the task. Closure lands a clear Conceptual Repricing (ruin to reverence), but the accumulation feels inevitable rather than earned through overcoming specific on-page obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on montage, summarizing weeks of wandering and excavation instead of sustaining tension in a contained scene. While the closure (deciding to stay) is legible, the lack of immediate scene pressure makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The single-scene structure is efficient, using the code-checking beat to establish stakes before the climax. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (mailing the letter) with an irreversible cost, and the orientation in time and place is handled immediately and clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and driven by a clear Causal lens: the flame’s signal triggers the need to finish and deliver the embroidery. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the intelligence is passed, and the protagonist’s role shifts from observer to active participant. The use of the eternal flame as a binary carrier signal is a clever, if slightly convenient, plot device that bridges the setting’s archaic and conspiratorial elements.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) closure where the client’s perspective shifts. However, the opening promise of "something far more dangerous" is a false setup; the actual process is therapeutic and safe, creating a causality gap between the stakes established in the exposition and the events of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative drive is tight, effectively using the anesthetic as a ticking clock to pressure the decoding scene. Closure lands as Charged Poise; the resolution to act tomorrow provides a decisive shift in stance towards the "dangerous truth," earning the ending despite the physical action being deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent arc from creative block to a Conceptual Repricing of her art. The closure is distinct and lands with the cost of abandoning her previous figurative approach, though the transition via the daydream sequence feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the acoustic anomaly to a decisive physical action with permanent consequences for the art. Closure lands effectively as a Decisive Change (destroying the surface to reveal the depth), though the final "wake or dream" ambiguity softens the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting threat (audit) to the ritualistic closure (becoming untaxable). The logic of the speculative conceit holds together well, and the ending delivers a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where the group's state is effectively altered. The connection between the insect behavior and the linguistic defense is established early and paid off clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering images of the shell, the poems, and the wind, but it lacks a distinct pattern break or cadence shift to mark a true turning point. The closure—a decision to write about the wind—is a soft conceptual shift ("peace with the ache") that feels more like a restatement of the premise than a reconfiguration earned by narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is a seamless Resonant Reconfiguration; the inciting incident (the crack) leads linearly to a closure that redefines the space from a museum of dead things to a living archive. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly, with the final beat landing with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and efficient, adhering to the single-scene scope with a clear inciting pressure (Marcus's arrival) and resolution. The closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration where the relationship is repaired through the cost of admitted shame. The causal chain—magic validates truth, truth validates trust—holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the adhesive investigation to the engineering solution. The closure unit—leaving the letter unsealed—is a decisive, risky action that effectively forces a resolution, satisfying the drive lens with a distinct change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to create an "honest paper trail" reweights the entire premise of her reinventions. The cost is legible and felt: she explicitly accepts the pain of "withering" naturally rather than fleeing. The narrative drive holds the Accumulative lens perfectly from the dust motes to the final ledger entry.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is coherent, moving from observation to a valid Conceptual Repricing where she chooses to "build thresholds." However, the pivot relies heavily on dialogue exposition rather than active pressure to force the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is decisive, but physical causality breaks when the feather, found wedged in a logbook inside the pressurized station, inexplicably floats outside the window without a mechanism for transit. The narrative leap from "gravitational waves" to "ancient residents" relies on a sudden assumption rather than an earned deductive chain.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path from hypothesis to experiment to realization (Conceptual Repricing). The pacing is effective, and the connection between the experiment and the conclusion is logical within the established magic system. Closure is firm, though the retrospective explanation of the seeds feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the setup of the arcade to the disrupting arrival of Rebecca. While the resolution (a stranger offering the perfect job) relies on high coincidence, it is thematically integrated as the "wilderness" entering Mara's controlled world. The sudden checkmate effectively forces the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.7)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence—finding the "moonstone cabochon dust speck" exactly when needed—to drive the resolution, which violates the causal requirement for problem-solving. While the final image offers closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), the path there is linear and lacks a "because/therefore" escalation of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where a single observation solves a thirty-year existential crisis with no visible cost or trade-off. The resolution feels symmetric and tidy, lacking the friction or consequence required for a high-band Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is heavily unbalanced toward backstory and reflection (~60%+), violating the BRR guideline and reducing the present frame to a static walk. The "Decisive Change" at the end feels like a soft reset arrived at via summary rather than pressurized on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic causality where arranging shells heals quantum divergence without a grounded mechanism. The closure—collapsing timelines into one—reads as a "soft reset" that erases the stakes of divergence with no visible cost or sacrifice. The resolution feels unearned, relying on a sudden shared realization that fixes the physical problem perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is legible and the "dreaming forward" concept lands a coherent Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the plot relies heavily on the "magic bullet" coincidence of finding the exact film negative of herself to force the resolution, which shortcuts the need for protagonist agency in solving the mystery. The causal link depends more on the environment's magic than the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "process" structure (arrive, paint, succeed) with no meaningful reversals or complications. The closure is a "mission accomplished" moment that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; the protagonist gains strength rather than paying a price for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, pivoting cleanly on the ritual reading of names. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes peace not as a permanent victory but as a fragile, earned "space between one violence and the next."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative relies on the heavy coincidence of natural fissures forming a perfect bird footprint and the rain synchronizing exactly with the egg's destruction. This creates a fable-like neatness that strains literary credibility and softens the causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (shattering the sanctuary) constitutes a Decisive Change, but the progression is strictly linear with no complications or tactical shifts. The protagonist succeeds in her primary goal without facing an unexpected obstacle that forces a change in approach or a deepening of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc from the inciting memory of the argument to the resolution at dawn. Closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing of his art, though the middle section relies on montage, eliding the specific frictional beats of the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and suffers from "symmetric satisfaction"—Mira builds a trap for memory, and the butterflies arrive exactly as planned to fill it. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands the thematic point, the lack of complication, error, or unexpected deviation leaves the plot feeling illustrative rather than dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear Causal arc with strong orientation in the icebound sanctum. The closure—leaving the bells behind to ring in the silence—provides a resonant resolution, though the lack of significant obstacles or twists during the ritual makes the success feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The circular paradox structure is executed cleanly, and orientation is solid. However, the closure relies on a neat realization ("everything, finally, made sense") that dissolves tension rather than resolving it through a choice with a visible price, limiting narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on the massive coincidence of a 4,000-year alignment occurring exactly three days after discovery, which undermines causal agency and suspense. The "three nights later" transition bifurcates the narrative, skipping the journey's friction and landing in a resolution phase that lacks the pressure of the opening scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the central conflict is resolved by a convenient "truth vision" that bypasses the need for the protagonist to actively discover or wrestle with the revelation. The resolution works conceptually as a repricing of the brother's death, but the lack of resistance makes the path there feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" ending—where the brother returns as a reflection—is conceptually sound. However, the inciting incident relies on the convenient appearance of the sextant, and the ritual progresses linearly to success without a complicating twist.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal lens holds firmly from the inciting backstory to the ladder climb and final reconciliation. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the relationship is restored on new terms. The ending feels earned, grounded in the specific cost of humility and the loss of the corporate contract.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a static epiphany to solve the central riddle; the realization ("first and last page" equals time) occurs in reflection rather than through active testing or consequence. This lowers the causal tension, making the resolution feel like a solution to a puzzle rather than a dramatic culmination. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of on-page resistance weakens the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "negative space" navigation is a strong structural device. However, the closure falls into "symmetric satisfaction"—the conflict resolves neatly with a "win-win" negotiation that lacks the required visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path guided by the swatch card, leading to a decisive conceptual repricing of the "garden" from a place to a process. The transition to physically pulling "narrative threads" is a slight leap in logic but fits the established surrealism, landing closure with a legible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.9)
    The plot follows a linear "problem-tool-solution" path with high convenience; the seal acts as a perfect key without requiring ingenuity or struggle to decode. The closure provides a tidy restoration of order ("Symmetric Satisfaction") without the requisite felt cost or complication to earn the resolution, making the ending feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (enter cave, find stone, activate stone, return) with no significant complications or reversals. The causality is functional but lacks friction; the protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles that force a change in tactics or a re-evaluation of the goal. The closure offers a "Decisive Change" but feels unearned due to the ease of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative hinge—overlaying random prism shards onto a map to find specific locations—strains credibility as a "National Treasure" style leap of logic rather than earned causality. While the departure offers a form of closure (Decisive Change), the "future-echo" undermines the narrative arc by resolving the outcome before the journey begins, rendering the ending a prologue rather than a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is efficient, with the investigation of shadows leading logically to the realization of recursion. The transition from observation to the climax (touching the crystal) is swift but earned by the dream-logic of the genre. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist pays the price of individuality to preserve the collective.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, delivering a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts a new identity ("filtering forward"). While the inciting incident (the magic note) is a bit convenient, the narrative moves efficiently to a legible closure that recontextualizes the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean with clear orientation and a distinct closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) that lands with emotional logic. The resolution feels slightly too tidy, resolving deep grief via a single conversation and a perfectly timed metaphor, but the structural integrity is high.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, utilizing the gravity inversion as a perfect structural pressure cooker. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (choosing the sky) that lands with the physical cost of the shattered vessel. The causality is flawless; the environment forces the action, which forces the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is competent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end within a single scene. However, the causality is soft; the resolution relies on a therapeutic monologue rather than dramatic action or pressure, resulting in a "tidy" ending where the conflict dissolves rather than resolving through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (downward ascension) provides a satisfying conceptual reconfiguration. However, the "ruby flake" acts as a plot device that resolves the central mystery via exposition dump ("showed her the truth"), bypassing the need for the protagonist to actively solve the puzzle of the throne room.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is linear and functional but lacks causal tension; the protagonist faces no resistance, and the "cost" (burning bridges) is relegated to backstory. The closure (holding hands/teaching) arrives without on-page struggle or a paid price, resulting in a soft "lesson learned" ending rather than a earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean and efficient, with the inciting incident (texts) leading directly to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure (formation of diamonds). While the linear progression lacks a complex reversal, the causality remains consistent within the story's surreal parameters.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from search to discovery to a closure that recontextualizes the past. The ending is strong, offering a decisive next step (tribal council) with legible stakes. A minor weakness is the reliance on "intuition" as a causal shortcut to locate the specific artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight, with the inciting incident (program) unlocking the backstory that reframes the present setting's pressure. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the unsnapping of the armor serves as a tangible cost (loss of defense) and a conceptual acceptance of the "strings" he once fled.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the inciting incident relies on poetic convenience; the physics of "dust patterns" leading to a specific file wedged behind others strains credibility in an otherwise realistic setting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, with clear orientation and a legible drive lens (Situational/Causal). The closure works well as Earned Stasis: she secures her safety at the cost of her cover identity. The reliance on the "two days ago" backstory to generate stakes slightly weakens the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a valid Conceptual Repricing closure (redefining victory as "hushing" rather than destroying). The causality is linear and low-friction; the magic works immediately without complication or cost beyond "trembling."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing months of time ("Each morning," "As months passed") instead of dramatizing a pivotal scene. Causality is external and magical; the climax occurs because a speck appears, not because the protagonist overcame a specific obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory that shifts effectively to Causal upon the compass's activation. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus alters his life's practice (repairing to preserve fractures). While structurally sound, the pivotal discovery relies on the convenience of the compass pointing directly to the solution, slightly weakening the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is exemplary; the narrative arc from the foundry to the magistrate’s door creates a clear, coherent causal chain. The closure is a precise Resonant Reconfiguration, where the lighting of the memorial candle signifies a profound shift in the magistrate’s state, anchoring the emotional resolution in a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    A flawless situational arc where the resolution (laughter) arises organically from the established constraint (the warped harp). The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the soul’s state—lands with legible emotional cost and clear thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative traces a clear arc from isolation to connection, ending with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance. While the mentor's explanation is slightly expository, the closure lands with the tangible cost of surrendering her defensive mask and accepting a new, terrifying peace.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magic shop" convenience where the vendor provides the exact tool and instruction immediately, bypassing the protagonist's agency in solving the translation problem. This direct line from need to solution lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from the inciting incident to a clear resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the protagonist accepts a new burden. The causality is functional, though the discovery of the hidden object feels slightly convenient and lacks significant obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from stasis to rupture, with the Operator serving as a precise catalyst. Closure is a Decisive Change; the library’s physical movement mirrors Marina’s internal shift. The loop is broken not by magic alone but by confronting the protagonist’s originating choice (the whisper).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Conceptual Repricing arc, recontextualizing the ruins from wealth to grief with a valid felt cost (admitting his revolution's error). Relying on the protagonist writing his epiphany in a journal renders the climax slightly static, but the internal logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: diagnosis, realization, and immediate fix via magic. While orientation and structure are clear, the closure lacks a felt or conceptual cost; the solution ("whispering the formula") feels convenient and lowers the dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is flawless, with a clear inciting incident (compass arrival) leading directly to the descent and the climactic decision. The closure—a Decisive Change where Mara abandons her previous life—lands with significant weight and is fully supported by the preceding causal chain. The "delve" serves as both physical journey and structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the Conceptual Repricing at closure is legible, but the plot relies heavily on the convenient discovery of the lantern slide to drive the resolution. The story follows a safe, linear path where obstacles (storm, GPS failure) provide atmosphere rather than genuine causal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a "prop ex machina" resolution; the grandmother's postcard conveniently contains the explicit thematic answer ("moon-rooted"), short-circuiting Mara's internal synthesis. This reduces the earned satisfaction of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain from the diary's discovery to the parley. Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant creates a lasting, costly new status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each night," "By the time spring arrived") rather than a dramatized scene, dissolving the climax into a montage. This fable-like distance prevents the formation of a concrete scene window with immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure is clear, but the twenty-year time jump offloads the causal work of the story to summary. The connection between the inciting incident (prophecy) and closure (acceptance) is fated rather than driven by active choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a definitive Decisive Change—the ice melts and the inheritance is spent—with visible cost. The causal logic of using temporal mass to reverse entropy holds the drive lens perfectly from the inciting incident to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from detection to the "switch" override and finally to the bell ringing. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the manual method is vindicated, though the "rope as technology" logic relies on a slightly convenient romanticization of the old ways.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story functions as a mood vignette (Accumulative/Textural lens) but lacks a decisive change or meaningful tightening. The ending ("Earned Stasis") reiterates the opening state without a fresh on-page cost; the sacrifice was paid seven years ago, leaving the current moment largely circular.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the orientation is solid, but the central conflict relies heavily on a block of exposition explaining the "tangled covenant" rather than showing its pressure in scene. The resolution is tidy and mechanical—reading the letter instantly solves the supernatural problem—lacking a sense of lingering complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    The day-night structure is legible and orientation is solid, but the narrative relies on episodic sequencing rather than causal pressure. The closure functions as Earned Stasis, yet the lack of an on-page obstacle or rising cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure (imperfect feather replaces the perfect kite) lands clearly. However, the causality relies on convenient timing (the drake appearing exactly when the kite snaps, the boy appearing immediately after) which feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on a six-month summary montage ("She rewired seventeen oak branches," "By her final week") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. This violates the short-form scope default (single scene or two shards) and distances the reader from the stakes. The narrative summarizes the transformation instead of showing the difficulty of the work in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a theoretical defense of the pilgrimage to a shared experiential commitment. The closure (Quorum joining the walk) acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, validating the protagonist's method while altering the stakes of the contact. Causality is tight, driven by the exchange of perspectives over the amber.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building the garden beat by beat to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. While the orientation and causality are sound, the trajectory is linear and lacks a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned against odds.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence (finding a bunker three miles away that a tracker missed for years) and a friction-free resolution. The community's immediate, unquestioning acceptance of the decoded map bypasses necessary conflict, resulting in a "too easy" ending that lacks earned causality or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on reflection and summary (approx. 60% of text) to explain the premise, leaving the present-time scene thin. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the momentum drags significantly due to the backstory load, which explains the transformation rather than dramatizing it in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure, but the resolution relies on the mentor explaining the central mystery ("world is becoming more") rather than the protagonist solving it. The exchange of the sundial lid lacks felt cost, as it is immediately returned with a bonus (coordinates), effectively removing the price of the transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is a clean, linear vignette that effectively establishes the premise, but the closure relies on an additive "meeting of minds" rather than a decisive change with cost. While the collaboration is a logical endpoint, it feels low-stakes and inevitable; the "interregnum" offers a setting but not a pressure cooker that forces a difficult choice. The ending resonates thematically but lacks the "felt cost" required for a higher-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from stasis to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist physically alters her nature. The causality of the feather "materializing" in her hand is a slight convenience that relies on the dream logic of the setting rather than active discovery, but the closure—pressing the stone into her chest—is a definitive, costly action that firmly resolves the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, and the "Conceptual Repricing" of the labyrinth and exile provides solid closure. However, the mechanics of the climax—literally decoding the words "PLATINUM" and "FORGIVE" letter-by-letter—feel somewhat gamified and simplistic for a literary piece, slightly undercutting the sophistication of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, utilizing the three-day limit to create coherent pressure. The interaction with the Elder serves as a perfect pivot, escalating the stakes before the final private moment. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the meaning of the echo shifts from distortion to a tool for "forging through."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is tight, effectively linking the physical action of the charm to the magical result. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the world state and Maya's role within it clearly. The specific success of the "forty-fifth pockmark" feels slightly arbitrary—a lucky break rather than a derived solution—but the surrounding pressure mitigates this convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the inciting incident to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands effectively with the distribution of the shells, though the initial transition to the cave relies on a slightly convenient psychological drift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax relies on fable logic (a ship at sea smelling a small vial of perfume from a lighthouse) that breaks the established realistic frame. The resolution provides symmetric satisfaction where everyone wins without cost; Thomas's instant conversion is unearned by the preceding events. The narrative lacks a decisive turning point driven by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative drive is strong, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of her purpose—lands with conceptual weight. However, the "midnight voice" functions as a convenient instructional device, handing Mara key insights (the bronze's nature) rather than forcing her to derive them solely through agency, which slightly softens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the climax dissolves into summary ("Word spread quickly") rather than dramatizing the pivotal first test of the relic. This reliance on montage flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on a fortunate coincidence—the protagonist holding the exact memory needed to decode the stranger's Edelweiss—which resolves the mystery of intent too easily. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the death into a delivery) is sound, the "police missed the key" trope strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from a riddle to a quest to a resolution. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the "promise," which is satisfying. However, the resolution relies heavily on a magical vision that dissolves the conflict rather than forcing a difficult active choice with a hard cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    Structure is solid and closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, causality is weakened by the "explain-everything" voice that resolves the mystery for the character. Additionally, the unexplained shift from "ember grotto" (dreams) to "cobalt grotto" (reality) creates a continuity hiccup.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions more as a static vignette or prologue than a fully driven scene; the "return" and its consequences are future-tense concepts rather than present-tense actions. While the Conceptual Repricing of light (commodity to testimony) works as a closure unit, the cost (heresy) is theoretical and not felt in the room.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is essentially a static vignette focused on reflection and backstory summary, exceeding the Reflection-led ceiling without anchoring enough active pressure in the present scene. There is no clear causal turn or meaningful tightening of options; the story begins and ends with Maren writing, offering Earned Stasis but lacking a dynamic arc or visible cost in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a valid closure unit through the refusal to fix the clock (Earned Stasis). However, the causal link between the mechanical diagnosis and the client's psychological resolution is purely symbolic, relying on poetic logic rather than tangible narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent but lacks friction; the central obstacle (crystallization) is dismissed too easily, turning the ritual into a linear procedure. Closure lands on a "symmetrical satisfaction" note where the protagonist gains healing without paying a visible on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the resolution—instantly deleting an old article from "every archive" via a phone in a barn—strains plausibility and feels like a soft reset. The digital mechanics undercut the supernatural weight, resolving a fifteen-year haunting with a few taps.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is clean, progressing logically from entry to the "Arbitration Chamber" to the final transformation (Conceptual Repricing). While the closure is legible and conceptually consistent, the "Great Hiccup" acts as a convenient external timer rather than pressure generated by the protagonist's active choices.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and conceptually daring, using the fabulist logic of "unwinding" time to resolve the inciting discrepancy. Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's worldview and role are fundamentally altered with visible physical cost. The "seam" realization perfectly recontextualizes the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is legible with the deletion of the number, but the causal path relies heavily on coincidence. Chen carrying the specific metaphorical prop (button) "for weeks" without cause is a contrivance that solves the protagonist's problem for her.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a high-coincidence plot device—subway graffiti forming a coherent English advice phrase via negative space through a specific antique lantern—to resolve the central conflict. This "puzzle-box" resolution undercuts the literary realism and solves the protagonist's struggle with a found answer rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise, with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure that reconfigures the premise ("Wrong number" becomes an invitation). The causality holds firmly under the lens; the callback creates a necessary pressure that forces the protagonist's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a linear sequence of arrival and explanation rather than causal pressure; the resolution (the return) feels coincidental to the scene's immediate action. The "why now" logic depends on a mystical schedule rather than the protagonist's agency or a clearly established rule set.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story establishes a strong inciting incident but relies on a montage ("Over the following days") to bridge the gap to the climax, diffusing narrative tension. The resolution—a collective realization of "permission"—operates as a conceptual summary rather than a decisive, scenic event with immediate consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (grief as territory to inhabit). However, the linear progression—magic tools working perfectly to lead straight to an epiphany—lacks friction or reversal. The closure lands clearly, but the mechanical convenience of the dowsing rods reduces the earned weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight, effectively using the single scene to pivot from mystery to revelation. Closure acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the rules of the universe are recontextualized with a clear shift in agency. The logic of the "edited past" holds firm, creating a satisfying and cohesive arc.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a "magic laptop" device to instantly resolve the central challenge of translating silence to music, bypassing necessary struggle. While the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (the camera click), the path there is frictionless and lacks causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from investigation to a Decisive Change where Mara chooses to sacrifice her freedom for the truth. The causal link between a Renaissance portrait and a prehistoric cave requires generous suspension of disbelief, but the closure lands with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds pressure through the garden's reactions, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The pivot from confusion to acceptance is well-paced, though the causality relies slightly on conversation rather than forced action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "test-and-pass" structure with a convenient resolution; the lock mechanism (recognizing a walk's rhythm via a coin tap) strains credibility. The ending offers satisfaction but lacks the required felt cost for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    The resolution relies on a jarring anachronism ("photographed" in a torch-lit guild era) and dubious physics (shadows forming legible maps on moving water). These logic breaks undermine the causal chain of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving from resignation to a decisive choice (Danny lying to his father). The closure lands with a clear Decisive Change, supported by the chess metaphor, though the causality is driven almost entirely by dialogue rather than action until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, but the climax relies heavily on coincidence (the whale calling at the exact moment of hesitation). This external prompt resolves the central tension, reducing the protagonist's agency in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for this length, moving efficiently from the established coping mechanism to a decisive confrontation. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with significant weight, trading the safety of the narration for the vulnerability of silence. The shift is causal and irreversible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path from entry to action without significant obstacles or twists. The "ban lifted" premise removes immediate tension, resulting in a victory lap structure rather than a pressure cooker. Closure lands on a reaffirmation of stance, but the lack of prior resistance makes the "cost" of the ban feel theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is purely linear: the protagonist identifies the problem and solves it immediately without complication, setback, or unintended consequence. While the closure is legible, the lack of an intermediate turning point creates a "fix-it" structure that feels too easy for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "set up and succeed" trajectory with no structural pressure or risk of failure to sharpen the climax. The closure relies on a realization ("finally understood") that feels unearned because the experiment proceeds perfectly without complication or cost, resulting in a tidy rather than resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central conflict. The transition "Senna worked for three weeks straight" elides the actual process of overcoming the tremor and the creative block, jumping straight from the assignment to the success. Closure lands with a resonant image, but the path there lacks causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a convenient logic leap where a measuring tape instantly decodes complex diagrams via "ratios," bypassing procedural realism. The closure offers a "happy ending" partnership without the requisite felt or conceptual cost, making the resolution feel unearned and overly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is sound with a clear Causal drive and effective Conceptual Repricing at closure. The inciting incident (entry) and climax (realization) are distinct, though the "lock" puzzle is resolved too quickly to generate significant structural friction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from investigation to realization to decision, with a legible closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Decisive Change). The structure is solid, though the lack of external obstacles makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a reflective state to a decisive action (writing the new title) that creates closure. The backstory is integrated effectively to establish stakes, though the epiphany arrives somewhat easily, relying on a convenient parallel between the animal's biology and her academic approach.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a decisive closure with a clear shift from seeking answers to seeking justice. However, the climax relies on a tenuous sympathetic link between the table and the crime scene (processed wood accessing a specific forest memory from centuries ago) which stretches the established "living plant" telepathy rules for convenience. While emotionally resonant, the mechanical causality of the table functioning as the star witness feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (repurposing the lost love) lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the plot relies on an "unkept set-up" regarding the grandmother's initials, and the climax hinges on a convenient magical projection rather than causal effort.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without facing meaningful setbacks or paying a visible cost. The resolution relies on a "fix-it" moment where a shift in attitude instantly resolves a centuries-old magical binding, lacking the causal weight or sacrifice required for a satisfying climax. The ending provides a "gain" without a corresponding price, failing the closure cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly with the symbolic movement of the clock. However, the plot is essentially a linear procedural of a successful delivery; the encounter with the traveler lacks causal teeth or reversal, serving only to validate Maren's existing path rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative is coherent and linear, functioning as a puzzle-solution sequence. However, the resolution relies on a "hologram" explanation that tidily resolves the mystery, reducing the ending's resonance. The causality is driven by dream logic and intuition rather than active decision-making, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fable logic holds together well, utilizing the ticket punch ritual to bridge the gap between searching for the dog and searching for self. The closure—running forward into the dark—is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, though the promise that the dog is waiting there softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scene follows a clear, linear path that deepens coherently; the staircase ascent mirrors the ascent to understanding. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Rielle's view of safety from isolation to shared burden. The pacing allows the weight of the "cost" to accumulate naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory (problem identified, solution applied, problem solved) with no causal complications or reversals. The closure brings a return to status quo without a felt cost or meaningful change for the protagonist. The "ink pellet" arrives via unmotivated magical delivery, acting as a convenient plot trigger rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution relies on a significant contrivance (the grandfather's tapping being convenient English Morse code) that strains credibility. The ending ties up the mystery mechanically without earning the revelation through on-page struggle or causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a convenient discovery ("something she'd missed before") to drive the plot, weakening causality. While the closure represents a Resonant Reconfiguration of her mission, the "cost" is purely theoretical—she abandons a failed strategy, but pays no immediate price in the scene (e.g., physical injury from the glass, loss of the glasses, or a painful realization about her own past complicity).

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with convenient bypasses for obstacles (crews sleeping, decoding completed in summary). While the ending is a Decisive Change, the progression feels inevitable rather than earned due to the lack of setbacks or complications.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece functions more as a vignette than a narrative with a causal arc; the transition from heavy backstory exposition to the couple's arrival is abrupt. While closure acts as Earned Stasis, the lack of a decisive present-action struggle weakens the structural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a strong Situational drive, where the contracting room forces a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The closure is distinct and earned, with the surreal causality holding together well under the genre's logic. The cost—accepting "necessary darkness"—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a tight, causal track where the fading clues create inherent urgency. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; Kael fulfills his duty ("Target acquired") but allows the "crisis moment" to alter his perception, effectively repricing the stakes of the hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from a charged descent to a decisive irreversible action with clear closure. While the timeline of the letter's arrival is slightly ambiguous (past receipt vs. present action), the ending lands a legible change in status for both the protagonist and the world.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scene possesses a tight, causal arc with clear orientation and a distinct Inciting Incident (Kael's arrival). The closure (Earned Stasis) is resonant; the sheathing of the blade and acceptance of tea signals a temporary ceasefire and acknowledgment of Mira's strength. The drive lens is Situational/Causal, holding tension until the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and the "set trap, catch prize" structure is executed with precision. The closure is legible, but the victory feels slightly low-cost; the plan works exactly as intended without a complicating twist, making the resolution feel smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "proof by contradiction" method provides a sturdy causal spine, turning an abstract logic puzzle into a concrete investigation. The closure—deciding to publish based on the realization that the retraction was a strategic trap—lands with high clarity and repurposes the father's apparent failure into victory.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The time-loop structure is handled competently, providing a clear inciting incident and closure mechanism. However, the resolution relies on the amber acting as a "magic key" that instantly fixes the conflict with minimal resistance or complication. The causality is smooth but lacks the friction required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and effective, moving from individual struggle to collective experience. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with genuine conceptual weight, recontextualizing the loss rather than falsely solving it. The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds firmly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path to resolution, but the causality of the climax relies on symbolic convenience rather than established mechanics. The sudden emergence of survivors ("others emerged") feels disconnected from the previous isolation and lacks a grounded setup, reading as an unearned reward for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot hinges on a deus ex machina: Margaux simply finds the "tarot coin" that solves her problem, bypassing protagonist agency. The narrative lacks a complication beat; it moves from desire to tool-acquisition (in summary) to successful execution without significant obstacles. The closure (fading into the garden) is resonant but feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is a flat "proof of competence" beat that lacks a decisive turn; the ending promises future action ("We start tomorrow") rather than delivering a closure unit with felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path (Discovery -> Connection -> Resolution) without significant complications or causal friction. The leap from encountering the alien emotion to fully understanding it via the leaf happens too smoothly, lacking the "felt cost" required for a high-band closure. The ending lands on a realization rather than a reconfigured state with price.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is coherent within a fable-like logic, but the resolution relies on a convenience—visitors arriving immediately to fix the metaphysical problem—that is not causally earned by the protagonist's small action. The closure is a "soft reset" where the conflict evaporates without a visible price or structural consequence, weakening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central premise (snow codes visible to binoculars but hidden from satellites) creates a significant logic gap. The resolution is linear and lacks resistance; the transition to the journalist is convenient, resolving the conflict without meaningful obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is impeccable for the length, with the rain gutters providing an organic ticking clock that frames the encounter. Closure is achieved through a clear Conceptual Repricing: the woman accepts the "whole" story over the "true" layer. The fog lifting exactly at the moment of realization is a pathetic fallacy that feels slightly convenient, preventing a higher score, but the causal chain is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story functions as a vignette with a "lecture" ending rather than a dramatized narrative. The resolution relies on a spectral figure explaining the theme in dialogue, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. There is no cost paid for the insight; the closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure works well for this length, building from the dead rosebush to the neighborhood mirrors to the final integration of the gauge tooth. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible and valid, connecting the two strands of her heritage, though the stakes of the turn are modest.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina (the book explicitly delivering the answer) to resolve the central conflict, nullifying causal pressure. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end is legible, it lacks a visible or felt cost, offering expansion without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands, but a continuity contradiction undermines the setup: the opening states the letter "wasn't hers," while the climax reveals she wrote it "to herself," confusing the prop's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal arc is clear and the closure—a shift from chaos to negotiation—is legible, but the resolution leans on convenience as the antagonist capitulates to the protagonist's first counter-move without a mid-climax complication.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the key) lands clearly. However, reliance on the "living" organ to guide navigation and mechanically unlock the disc reduces protagonist agency; the environment solves the problem for her.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The resolution relies on a "magic art" trope where an ambiguous, atmospheric drawing triggers specific, evidential memories (a man's gait, a matching mask) without a concrete causal bridge. The climax is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from decoding to a decisive exit, fulfilling the closure requirement with a physical departure. The causality holds, though the transition from intellectual discovery to life-threatening action feels rushed; Kao’s rapid agreement accelerates the ending at the expense of earned persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "find key, unlock door" structure with low causal friction; the leap from observing Morse code to playing a magical violin solution is swift and convenient. Closure is achieved, but the "magic fix" lacks a commensurate on-page cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively bridging the backstory of the startup/robbery with the present confrontation on the train. Closure lands clearly with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the father stays), though the causal link between the conversation about currency and the life-altering decision relies heavily on shared history rather than immediate on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (shifting from isolation to shared burden). The resolution relies on a "lock and key" moment—one star period matching one symbol instantly solves the mystery—which feels like a convenient soft reset of the intellectual difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal arc is tight and logical: diagnosis (seeds) leads directly to the change in tactics (war-song), which forces the resolution. The orientation is immediate, and the closure—retracing the path outward—provides a solid structural bookend. The brevity compresses the rising action slightly, but the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is linear and follows a "problem/solution" track without significant complications or reversals; the ritual succeeds immediately upon execution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost (crumbling the topiary) feels symbolic rather than visceral. The orientation is stable, but the resolution lacks the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot pivots beautifully on the failed reversal, forcing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the character must accept a new reality rather than a simple reset. The closure is decisive, with the cost (pain) explicitly accepted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive internal shift at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively, earning the protagonist's new stance through the pressure of the scene rather than external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic pill" resolution where the central object solves the protagonist's struggle instantly without agency or consequence. The ending falls into the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, explicitly summarizing the mechanics of the mystery rather than allowing the closure to land through dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is sturdy, linking the visitor's distress to the library's function and the final resonant reconfiguration. The ending lands a clean closure effect, re-contextualizing the "loop" through the scroll, though the resolution comes with relatively low resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is strictly linear and relies on a "found letter" to explain the narrative purpose, lacking a complication or reversal to test the protagonist's resolve. Closure is achieved through a sudden, frictionless shift in stance rather than a hard-won realization.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece operates as a montage of weeks rather than a dramatized scene, which distances the reader from immediate stakes. While the mosaic pattern is taught early, the lack of a concrete, high-pressure "now" moment reduces the ending's impact to a philosophical summary rather than a visceral shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear path to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the quest's purpose transforms. However, the puzzle-solving lacks friction; the protagonist arrives fully prepared, and the solution proceeds without unexpected complications or on-page failures to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.5)
    A causality break undermines the central constraint: the bow is described as "never melting despite the summer heat" just lines after the violin is predicted to dissolve at dawn. Additionally, the resolution hinges on an unestablished asset (the encrypted network) rather than a resource developed in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative line—preparation leading to a final effect—but lacks a complication that forces a change in tactics. The closure is a form of "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist intends to do a job and succeeds perfectly; without a felt cost or a moment of doubt, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is solid, with clear orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the protagonist accepts a new paradigm. The causality follows a dream-logic typical of fables, which works for the genre, though the resolution relies heavily on a sudden supernatural reveal rather than cumulative narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean causal arc from the inciting guilt to a decisive internal reconfiguration. The pacing is efficient, using the lighthouse visit to force the confrontation with her past failure. Closure is distinct and legible: a Resonant Reconfiguration where she changes her methodology and accepts uncertainty, satisfying the prompt's closure requirement with a felt cost (loss of profitable certainty).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene has a legible structure and clean closure that lands the "appearing to vanish" paradox. However, the internal logic of the backward aging is poetic but slippery; the phrase "future she'd already forgotten" clashes slightly with the linear progression of the scene, creating mild orientation drag. The lesson feels earned, but the setup relies heavily on exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: arrive, diagnose, resolve to work. While the causal logic holds, the arc lacks a meaningful turn or reversal; the "climax" is a moment of uncontested realization. Closure is weak, relying on a commitment to future off-page labor rather than an immediate, paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc where physical endurance and failure lead to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview. Closure is earned; the shift from active spell-casting to passive reception is a legible causal turn supported by the established logic of the keystone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is solid, but the climax relies on a causal blur: the captain's quarters are described as "sealed by chance... swollen shut," yet Mara immediately accesses the contents without a dramatized breach or effort. The "easy" discovery bypasses the scene's central physical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal logic of "backwards prophecy" serves the drive lens well, and the pivot to "instruction" is a strong conceptual turn. However, the climax compresses the three-day countdown into a summary montage, flattening the tension just as the stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reflective structure is competently managed, anchoring memories in the physical props of the observatory to avoid floating abstraction. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where she renames her fear as sacrifice—lands with clarity, though the lack of active present-tense pressure limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal logic of the "oversaturated" ocean and the bell’s resonance is distinct and legible, holding the fable-like tone together. The closure is decisive and earned, though the protagonist's deduction of the cosmic imbalance ("He'd figured that much out") occurs in backstory summary, reducing the immediate dramatic weight of that discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The timeline contains a significant orientation failure: "three hours before dawn" contradicts the simultaneous "twilight," as pre-dawn is typically deep night, destabilizing the scene's temporal logic. Additionally, the logistics of a ninety-year-old woman descending a slick, algae-covered reservoir bank in the dark to plant a precise trail of photographs strain credibility to the breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure that resolves in symmetric satisfaction (she wants X, she gets X) without a complication or cost. The closure lacks the required &quot;felt cost&quot; or reconfiguring pressure; it validates her premise perfectly without testing it against a live counter-force. Causality is functional, but the appearance of the starlings in the steam relies on convenient magical realism rather than earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and the pacing works well for the length, with a clear inciting incident and climax. However, the resolution relies on Command simply accepting the explanation ("recognition"), which lowers the tension; the protagonist wins by explaining rather than by enduring a tangible on-page cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to co-parent is not a compromise but a philosophical synthesis with visible emotional cost (Kira accepting her coldness as a tool). The pacing is tight, and the causality of the argument flows logically to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands clearly with a decisive refusal, but the central causal mechanism—competitors closing "within weeks" due to a plant that takes years to bloom—strains plausibility. This timeline contradiction weakens the narrative foundation, making the threat feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure effectively builds from isolation to connection, utilizing the "singing caves" as a strong unifying device. However, the closure relies on Sarah's immediate acceptance ("Show me"), which resolves the tension a beat too easily for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and causally tight, moving from a clear objective to a decisive action with legible consequences. The closure lands effectively as a Return/Earned Stasis, resolving the immediate threat while re-establishing the character's permanent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the orientation is solid. However, the resolution relies on a "magic just works" causality where the application of the forbidden rites immediately solves the central problem without complication. The "penny drops" moment is narrated as a realization rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear Causal path: problem, memory, action, result. While coherent, the "turn" relies on a convenient memory of the mentor rather than active struggle or failure that forces a hard choice. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of resistance or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on a deus ex machina: the hourglass spontaneously reveals a map of "invisible etchings" to solve the crisis, bypassing earned deduction. The climax lacks a true turning point, as the obstacle dissolves immediately upon Mateo's suggestion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist reframes her understanding of memory. However, the progression is frictionless; the protagonist encounters no meaningful setbacks or failures, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, successfully shifting the protagonist's paradigm. However, the progression is linear and low-friction—the alien simply provides the answer without a complication or reversal to test the protagonist's commitment, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on coincidence (Lily arriving exactly as the signal is decoded) rather than causal progression driven by the protagonist's choices. Closure is neat and administrative ("making calls") with no felt cost or sacrifice on the page, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    The scene structure is functional, but scientific and historical logic breaks harm credibility. "Medieval monasteries recording... telegraph lines" is a jarring anachronism, and equating tidal movement with "phase transitions" (vapor/ice) strains the hard-science POV.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands cleanly, but the central mechanism—using spilled ink patterns to defragment digital server drives—strains plausibility in a hard sci-fi setting. While it satisfies the prompt, the causal link between analog chaos and specific digital data reconstruction reads as techno-magic, weakening the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the causal chain linking light, echoes, and birds relies heavily on poetic logic that strains credibility even within a fantasy frame. The dismissal of the diamond's "curse" as a mere misunderstanding deflates potential tension early.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; Maya's acceptance of the tea and arrowhead signals a clear, costly shift in stance from investigator to participant. The causal chain is tight, with the phone call serving as a decisive bridge between the setting's lore and the protagonist's unresolved grief.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative suffers from a "magic feather" resolution where the central problem dissolves instantly upon the protagonist's first attempt. The threat established in the setup (statues preventing disturbance) evaporates without creating an actual obstacle or crisis point. Causality is weak; the violin breaking is a token cost that feels disconnected from the massive societal change achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clean, logical "errand" structure, but the resolution relies on a pre-established gadget (the null-field) rather than a dynamic in-scene tactical pivot or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the pivotal halo fragment fits "perfectly" without struggle, and the climax succeeds without a complication, resulting in a closure beat that feels unearned due to lack of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "enactment" structure where a plan succeeds exactly as intended without complication or sacrifice. The closure offers "Symmetric Satisfaction"—a positive outcome with no visible, felt, or conceptual cost to balance the magical gain.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative is front-loaded with summary and backstory, delaying the present-action scene until the midpoint. While the closure is definitive, the logic connecting the photos to the "cipher" relies on convenient magical leaps rather than causal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "guided tour" structure where the mentor explains the magic system and solves the central puzzle (the ribbon coordinates) for the protagonist. The closure (Mara becomes the locksmith) is a decisive change, but it feels unearned because the obstacle (the lock) was opened by following instructions rather than protagonist ingenuity or sacrifice. The causality is soft; the Locksmith's presence lowers the stakes rather than raising them.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure is solid, leading to a resonant conceptual reconfiguration of memory. The link between the celestial constellation and the physical drift of shipwrecks relies on magical convenience that loosens the causal grip slightly, but the closure lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scene functions as a linear vignette with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but lacks causal tension; the conflict is resolved via explanation rather than action. Closure is achieved, but it feels tidy and didactic ("a lesson"), with the concept of "reversible exile" solving the emotional problem too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect structure (ritual process), but the trajectory is low-tension and predictable. The closure is tidy and absolute ("preservation was complete"), lacking the "felt cost" or trade-off required for higher bands; the price paid (a drop of blood, aching knees) is transactional rather than narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is linear and procedural, functioning as a low-stakes exorcism where success feels inevitable from the start. While the orientation and inciting incident are clear, the story lacks a decisive turning point where the protagonist's capacity is truly tested; the closure is a "job done" restoration that lacks a palpable felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, using the comparison mechanic to create a clear causal chain from observation to realization. The closure is excellent, offering a Decisive Change (leaving the vault open) that reconfigures the stakes from containment to exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from discovery to a resonant closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) that feels earned. The causal link between the Earhart discovery and the current resignation is strong, though the "equilibrium" physics are slightly distracting.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the accumulative structure works, but the resolution arrives without meaningful obstacles or failure risk. The ending feels like a standard procedural completion rather than an earned reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The elevator structure provides excellent mechanical pressure, acting as a ticking clock that forces the climax at the tenth floor. The closure is a clean Decisive Change (choosing descent over promotion). The causality of decoding the diary is well-linked to the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative drive lens works well, using cloud formations to build the "spooled wholeness" theory step-by-step. The closure lands a clear Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the "empty" sky as a vessel of memory, though the lack of external pressure softens the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean situational arc with a clear deadline (demolition) forcing a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is effective: she accepts the limitation and reconfigures the portrait's meaning, paying the cost of never truly knowing the subject.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally driven, moving from a chance observation to a decisive reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality. Closure is excellent; the act of erasing the map secures the secret and fundamentally alters the status quo with undeniable pressure. The Drive Lens (Causal) holds firmly from the inciting incident to the final strategic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal path from problem to resolution with legible closure via the completed repair. However, the connection between the prophecy scraps and the location is summarized rather than dramatized, and the procedural creates little narrative drag or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies on a summary montage ("At dawn," "After two weeks," "The recovery came slowly") to bypass the central conflict, resulting in a linear progression without causal friction. Closure is achieved through a thematic lecture rather than a decisive change or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and structurally sound, moving from the inciting demand of the Clock to the execution of the task and a reflective exit. However, the plot is linear and low-resistance; the resolution relies on an abstract, magical success ("embedded... seeds of reversal") within the "pane of hush" rather than a concrete causal struggle. Orientation and pacing are handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, with a clear inciting incident and rising action fueled by the ticking clock of the frost. The closure lands firmly via a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist recontextualizes the setting, though the solution (shadow alignment) borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration with the ash-scattering ritual, where the setting forces a specific, meaningful deviation from the plan. The causality is strong, though the epiphany beat ("An insight struck her") relies on summarized realization rather than dramatized discovery, slightly weakening the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving cleanly from request to transaction to resonant reconfiguration. Closure is achieved through a conceptual gift that redefines the customer's path. The lack of significant obstacles or complications makes the trajectory feel linear and low-risk, though the logic holds up well under a lyrical/situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving cleanly from the inciting problem (rotting memories) to resolution. The causal link between "analyzing tidal pools" and the manifestation of the pavilion relies on "memory made its own rules," which functions as a soft-magic handwave rather than earned causality. Closure is distinct and effective, though the "solution" feels somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality falters significantly at the closure: the removal of the critical weight has no effect on the clock's precision, erasing the only potential cost of the protagonist's choice. This "magic fix" creates a symmetrical satisfaction that lacks narrative consequence or earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    The scene is coherent and the use of the mirror as a focal point anchors the causality well. However, the closure relies on a smooth success with minimal on-page cost; the "quaking" is atmospheric rather than a price paid, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is a straightforward fetch quest where the protagonist retrieves the prize exactly as anticipated, resulting in symmetric satisfaction. The closure lacks a decisive change in Lyra's status or a reconfiguration of the stakes beyond simply acquiring the asset.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear success trajectory—setup, performance, total victory—without a decisive turn or meaningful complication. The resolution (resurrecting an extinct species) feels like an unearned magical reward disproportionate to the mechanical process described. The lack of a "felt cost" or sacrifice makes the ending read as wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from investigation to realization to transmission. The closure functions well as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the covenant not as broken but incomplete. However, the resolution comes easily via conversation, lacking a moment where the "cost" of this truth tests Kavir's resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a coherent fabulist logic where emotional frequencies affect physical locks. The closure (Renunciation) is distinct and meaningful; she succeeds in opening the lock but chooses not to violate the privacy, satisfying the plot while subverting the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story violates the short-form scope default (single scene or two shards), relying instead on a montage that spans weeks/years. This structure flattens causal tension; the climax (blooming) happens after a summary of time passing, preventing a dramatized turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and coherent under a Causal lens, but the closure fails the cost-proof test; Mara retrieves the prize without paying a visible price (emotional, physical, or tactical). The climax relies on an "explain-everything" scene where the echoes act out the theme, reducing the ending to a gift rather than an earned reconfiguration. The lack of a decisive obstacle makes the structure feel like a procedural fetch-quest.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the resolution—transmitting data causing cranes to instantly move in an evacuated port—relies on convenient, unseen agency that lowers the sense of difficulty. While the closure breaks the pattern, the cost is purely conceptual (a shift in mindset) rather than a felt or sacrificed price.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The resolution relies on a "measure the magic" trope where wonder is saved by quantifying it as biological data ("oxygenated blood"); this convenient fix undercuts the premise and resolves the conflict without personal cost or on-page ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line to a valid Decisive Change where the protagonist leaves her world. While the closure lands with a conceptual cost (abandoning home), the lack of on-page complications—the ritual works perfectly on the first try—lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the messenger's arrival to the printing of the emotional map. The closure—an Earned Stasis where she continues working despite the dying stars—lands effectively. The link between "understanding the math" and "saving the stars" remains slightly tenuous, relying on soft magic logic rather than causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, episodic structure (Merchant -> Shepherd -> Keeper) where the protagonist is rewarded for obeying a magical object. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) relies heavily on the Keeper explaining the plot's meaning in dialogue rather than dramatizing the realization through action. The lack of visible cost or consequence for the "delays" flattens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The scene structure is efficient with a clear inciting moment and resolution. The closure (alliance formed via "truthful lies") is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The pacing is solid, though the coincidence of the frost appearing perfectly for this moment is a minor convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a definitive Decisive Change at closure, satisfying the causal drive lens. However, the plot relies heavily on grandmother’s expository backstory to establish the rules, rather than Mariko actively discovering the mechanics in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience: the magician arrives exactly when needed, and his grandmother’s silk fortuitously holds the specific root patterns required. The climax is summarized ("worked through the night") rather than dramatized, eliding the pivotal struggle and deflating the causal tension of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative builds to a critical choice but resolves via deferral ("Tomorrow... she would make her decision"), which deflates immediate tension and avoids on-page cost. While the final sensory image implies a direction ("tasted like goodbye"), the explicit postponement muddies the closure, making the piece feel like a prologue.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the supply run to the rescue and the decision to join the letter chain. Orientation and pacing are effective. However, the plot relies on the convenient timing of the lamp failure to force the epiphany, and the mechanism of the letter chain feels slightly contrived as a plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual (Situational lens) without a decisive turn or reversal that alters the protagonist's trajectory; the mid-story reflection on the newspaper clipping stalls momentum to explain stakes that should be active in the scene. Closure is an Earned Stasis, but the lack of an obstacle makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from arrival to explanation to resolution. The ending creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she accepts the apprenticeship, though the lack of resistance or complication makes the closure feel somewhat inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (Task Assigned → Task Performed → Task Complete) that lacks a meaningful turn or complication. While the closure provides a conceptual answer to Mara's inquiry, the cost is low (mere labor), resulting in a soft resolution that explains rather than dramatizes the change.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (perform ritual → succeed) with no significant obstacles or deviations; while the closure is decisive, the trajectory is predictable and lacks a felt cost beyond stated exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with low friction; the resolution is handed to the protagonist via a monologue rather than achieved through action. The causality is soft, relying on the magical setting to explain the solution to the character's life problem.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, driven by a clear situational logic. The closure acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing (moving from documentation to transformation), offering a legible solution to the central problem with inherent cost (accepting the loss of the original).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.9)
    The plot hinges on a deus ex machina—the lucky discovery of a "misfiled" slide—to resolve the central thematic despair. This coincidence simplifies the narrative arc, replacing earned causal progression with a convenient turning point that lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and causally tight, with the recording device providing a decisive turn. The resolution relies heavily on the "I have copies" trope, which works within the genre but resolves the tension somewhat conveniently. Closure is distinct, solidifying the "strangers" status.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear vignette rather than a causal story; the central turn is informational (showing the compass) rather than dramatic. Closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" (redefining the curse as an election), but because Kael accepts it immediately without cost or complication, the resolution feels flat and purely convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative structure is functional, with clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the middle section relies on a static backstory block to deliver key information about the mother and lock. The climax is accumulative rather than distinct; the transition from discovery to resolution feels convenient and lacks a sharp causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.3)
    Momentum suffers significantly from the summary bridge ("Days blurred into weeks") which elides the actual investigation and struggle. The closure is a Decisive Change, but it lacks a felt cost; the protagonist trades a toxic environment for a sanctuary, which reads as an upgrade rather than a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic: ice melts, sound shifts, purpose clarifies. The closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing of "truth." However, the arrival of the pilgrims functions as convenient external validation (a "victory lap" beat) rather than a complication that tests the protagonist's new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative structure is flawless under a Causal lens, moving from the established protocol (miniaturization) to a decisive obstacle (the photo) that forces a Resonant Reconfiguration of the goal. The closure—burying the memory to let it grow rather than burning it—lands with distinct conceptual and emotional cost, perfectly resolving the "static" into "discordant harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The resolution relies on a "magic folder" deus ex machina—documents found in a mailbox that conveniently contain all the evidence needed to stop the developers. This acts as a soft reset, resolving the high external stakes (eviction) without a corresponding sacrifice or cost paid by the protagonist. The cause-and-effect chain is mechanical (find key → open box → solve problem).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story functions as a linear vignette or process narrative rather than a dramatic scene with a decisive turn. There is no inciting incident within the scene itself; she arrives, works, and leaves without encountering a specific, high-stakes obstacle that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is decisive and resonant; the final transformation (becoming a memory-crystal) is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost. The narrative arc from the gravity anomaly to the specific cause (whale heart) is tight and logically sound under the story's dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation and causality are precise; the "magic fix" (the wing) is properly established as the result of months of labor, avoiding a deus ex machina feel. The closure—an Earned Stasis where the threat is neutralized—lands effectively with a conceptual cost (the burden of silence). The narrative arc is tight and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is exceptionally tight, with a clear inciting move (the seal) leading directly to a reconfiguration of the relationship. The closure is a decisive change that alters the status quo with visible emotional cost—the abandonment of Elena's "normal" safety net.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent; the act of writing the refusal and burying the shell constitutes a Decisive Change with clear conceptual and social cost (loss of legitimacy). The drive lens (Hybrid Causal/Situational) holds firmly from the envelope's introduction to the dawn deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causality holds, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's status shifts from criminal to sanctioned agent. However, the resolution relies on a "handover" of permission rather than an active struggle, making the climax feel slightly convenient. The brevity of the piece limits the opportunity for a deepening complication before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the central revelation is delivered passively via the seashell's monologue rather than earned through active deduction or struggle. The concept of "progressive disclosure" feels inserted as a pacing mechanism rather than an organic plot driver. Closure is achieved, but the "explain-everything" nature of the artifact deflates the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Causal drive with clear orientation and definitive closure (the decision to go to Halifax). The "melted" glass physics momentarily disrupts verisimilitude in a technical diving context, but the arc is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a didactic parable structure rather than a causal dramatic arc; the resolution is achieved through explanation rather than a high-stakes choice or action. The ending is tidy and lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, serving as a "soft reset" of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "video game log" device: finding shredded papers containing the exact plot explanation and coordinates sitting loosely in a windy wasteland. This contrivance significantly undermines the causal chain; it is implausible that someone trying to hide a secret would shred documents on-site and leave them to be easily reassembled.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the linear progression lacks a meaningful complication; the "cost" is retrospective (her past career) rather than a price paid on the page, reducing the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and circular, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the causal chain is weak; the magic system is explained rather than tested, and the climax (releasing the jars) meets no resistance, resulting in a linear progression without significant tension or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is efficient with a clear causal chain and high-stakes closure that lands with the cost of guardianship. The arrival of the boat is a functional if slightly convenient pressure mechanism, but the resolution—locking the key to her heartbeat—provides a legible Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, gathering data to prove a point, and orientation is solid. However, the closure—waiting for spring to reveal findings—feels like a deferred resolution rather than an on-page decisive change; the cost (numb fingers) is mild relative to the declared revolutionary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is seamless: the lantern leads to the symbols, which lead to the gap and the chamber. The closure is a decisive, irreversible act of rebellion (sending the files) that creates a resonant reconfiguration of her status and the tunnel's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is achieved via a Conceptual Repricing of the heart's damage, but the plot relies on a fragile logic where physical reality is retconned as "patina" to serve the moral. The letter functions as a soft deus ex machina that overrides the initial technical stakes without a commensurate struggle or discovery in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc from stagnation to breakthrough, achieving a decisive change in the protagonist’s departure. However, the spatial logistics at the climax blur; the shift from "redirected the gears... pointing her floating laboratory" to "pushed off... her cart gliding" creates momentary confusion about whether the workshop and cart are the same vessel or if she is leaving one for the other.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, leading to a definite closure where the protagonist undergoes a decisive change. However, the pivotal moment where the encryption opens "as if expecting her" bypasses a crucial opportunity for agency and problem-solving, slightly weakening the causal chain of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on the magic system to act as a deus ex machina; the mirrors simply show the necessary backstory (Astrid) to solve the puzzle without Maren actively deducing it from existing clues. Closure is a "Charged Poise" moment—anticipating the solution rather than enacting it—which feels slightly unearned given the ease of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is sound, and the postponement of the consultation serves as a clear Decisive Change. However, the final transition ("stayed... through summer, then autumn") relies on summary to bypass the immediate aftermath of the decision, distancing the reader from the cost of living on.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene structure is coherent, utilizing a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the "turn" feels static—relayed through a prepared speech rather than emerging from dynamic pressure between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative is a linear problem-solution arc that lands a solid Earned Stasis closure (preservation of the clearings). While mechanically sound and oriented well, the absence of complications, twists, or a felt cost to the protagonist limits the dramatic weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: arrival, explanation, activity, resolution. The closure relies on a "soft reset" where deep-seated socioeconomic grief is cured by a single art session, lacking the necessary causal struggle or cost to earn the ending. The drive lens is nominally accumulative, but the accumulation of drawings feels mechanical rather than pressure-building.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc moves cleanly from observation to epiphany to a "Charged Poise" closure where the stance shift is decisive. The reliance on the crystal’s convenient "sonic projection" capability—essentially a techno-magical device—weakens the causal rigor, solving the central mystery with a tool rather than intellectual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a flawless Accumulative arc, building pressure through the shrinking chalk and the physical act of writing against time. The closure creates a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the "sound" he sought is revealed to be the silence of accumulation itself. The logic of the "negative prophecy" holds together perfectly, delivering a satisfying and costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting tremor to a resonant closure via reconfiguration. The causality follows a dream-logic or magical realism rule-set (the clock hand sympathizing with the moon) which works within the established tone, though it might strain suspension of disbelief if read as hard sci-fi. The closure is decisive and conceptually costly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent but relies on "movie logic" where a symbolic gesture (fitting broken record pieces) instantly resolves six years of silence. The causality between the cello performance and the daughter's immediate forgiveness feels unearned and summary-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and achieves a definitive Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the pivotal discovery—finding a keyhole she had "previously missed" on a central device she studies daily—is a convenience that weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is efficient and compelling, moving from the disruption of the fake body to the garden encounter without wasted motion. The inciting incident (the body in the millpond) provides excellent immediate pressure that justifies the scene's existence. Closure is distinct and definitive; the decision to "bridge the gap" represents a clear Decisive Change in her worldview and life path. The causal link between the tooth, the daughter's explanation, and the mother's choice is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative drifts significantly into general summary ("Children had started coming last month...") which breaks the immediacy of the "one continuous scene" constraint. This expository block deflates the specific tension of the current polishing task, resolving the story's emotional stakes via off-stage events rather than the on-page action. The closure relies on this generalized success rather than the specific outcome of the scene's effort.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a convenient "letter from the grave" to retroactively absolve the protagonist, deflating the established guilt without a felt cost. The resolution comes from external information rather than a causal chain driven by the protagonist's actions in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure works efficiently, gathering images to fuel a Conceptual Repricing closure where the premise shifts from mercy/vengeance to witnessing. However, the progression is linear and predictable; the protagonist functions as a passive observer until the final decision, with no external obstacles complicating the visit.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path of predictable success; the plan works exactly as intended without complication or failure. The closure is a "success state" that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, failing the cost proof test for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure ("success montage") where the ritual proceeds without complication or unexpected cost. While the closure (sealing the map) is legible, the lack of a causal turn or obstacle during the rising action flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative moves smoothly but relies on a massive speculative leap—deducing “temporal echoes” from light angles—that is asserted rather than earned. The resolution is tidy and symmetric; the community’s instant acceptance dissolves potential tension without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds the "mandala" of burdens, leading naturally to the realization at the closure. The transition from the list of burdens to the protagonist's epiphany is smooth, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the legible conceptual cost of accepting her function.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is elegant and tight, utilizing the boiling kettle as a natural clock to compress the timeline and escalate pressure. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration through the finished object, though the emotional resolution relies slightly on the narrator's final summary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing where acceptance restarts time, and the "Situational" lens holds coherence. However, the narrative arc is compressed; the leap from the inciting presence of the ghost to the resolution lacks a complicating middle beat or meaningful deepening of the dilemma before the solve.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from observation to epiphany to action under a coherent Accumulative/Situational lens. Orientation is excellent. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the terminal, though the "email to the boss" resolution feels slightly convenient and lacks a high-friction pivot point or visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is excellent; the decision to apprentice creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear social and temporal cost, avoiding a magical "instant success" fix. The narrative arc is coherent, though the orientation regarding the magical properties of the setting relies on a brief expositional setup.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing closure, effectively recontextualizing the world logic and Viktor's fate. The narrative arc is coherent under a Situational lens, though the lack of a tangible sacrifice or difficult trade-off limits the weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative structure functions well, moving from the rope’s exterior to the hidden map, deepening the reader's understanding of the "secret weavers." The closure—resealing the rope for a personal archive rather than a museum—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "inciting" pressure is low, relying heavily on curiosity rather than urgent necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is cohesive and the closure (reframing absence as intermission) is legible. However, the causal link between Maren's challenge and the Duchess's weeping is abrupt; the problem resolves via a conversation that feels like a therapy breakthrough rather than a pressure-tested structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from arrival to assembly to resolution with a defined closure unit (Conceptual Repricing of beauty). The primary weakness is the "assembly" sequence, which is summarized ("worked through the night") rather than dramatized, lowering the causal tension of the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    The scene follows a linear, low-friction path where a ritual solves a deep trauma with convenient speed. The closure (Elena's acceptance) feels unearned by the preceding action, relying on a monologue to resolve the conflict rather than a costly causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The breadcrumb structure is linear but effective, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the city remembers. Causality holds, though the solution (pressing panels matching the fountains) is convenient and lacks a significant complication to test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "Soft Reset" resolution where magic light fixes a mechanical failure without causal cost or trade-off, violating the closure requirement for felt price. The structure is linear and lacks a decisive turning point generated by character agency; the ending provides relief but no earned structural reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Marcus spent the remaining light teaching her... weeks later") to bridge the inciting incident and the resolution, dissipating immediate scene pressure. This "soft reset" via time compression avoids dramatizing the actual moment of change or difficulty. The closure lands, but the path is paved by summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, adhering strictly to the "pause in the pendulum" timeframe which creates a natural container for the action. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock restarts, now carrying a secret weight that recontextualizes Maren's duty. The structure effectively balances the backstory (rake handle) with the present crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the grandmother's legacy from simple gardening to an act of historical preservation. However, the pivotal epiphany ("something clicked") shortcuts the causal logic; the leap from realizing "intention" to reading coordinates is thematic rather than strictly logical, slightly weakening the satisfaction of the solve.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with clear orientation and a legible outcome (Decisive Change). However, the progression is linear and low-resistance; the conflict with the predictive models is resolved through summary rather than a dramatized turning point with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and moves cleanly from stasis to discovery to decisive action. However, the resolution relies on a "magic key" discovery (lyrics as recipe) that unlocks the problem instantly without significant obstacles or complications, lowering the sense of earned narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc from the inciting incident (chair) to a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. While the magical ash-writing beat feels slightly convenient structurally, the final beat firmly re-contextualizes the premise with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The closure is excellent, with the handing over of the cog serving as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration that solidifies the alliance. The cost is distinct—he gives up his "most precious possession"—and the logic of the turn follows the established "sedimentary" metaphor perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, didactic path where a complex social problem is solved instantly by a single exercise, lacking the friction or "cost" required for a literary climax. The ending acts as a summary of the moral ("this is how traditions survive") rather than a dramatic closure unit where the stakes are irreversibly reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a broad summary bridge to bypass the actual conflict of establishing the rebellion, resolving the central tension off-page without a dramatized climax.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "talking heads" dynamic where one character explains the backstory to another to resolve the plot. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, it feels unearned by protagonist action, and the "explain-everything" ending reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is coherent and linear, functioning as a "just-so" story of magical ritual. However, the resolution relies on a convenient magical response from the house rather than causal pressure, making the closure feel like a gift rather than a consequence of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scene is tightly constructed with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the statue’s release marks a definitive change. The integration of backstory via telepathy maintains the present-moment anchor without dissolving the underwater tension. The pacing effectively matches the "ticking" oxygen gauge, creating a cohesive narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a clear causal arc where the dream sequence provides the necessary insight for the waking resolution. While the "waking up at the desk" transition risks feeling like a soft reset, the closure unit (sending the email) creates a decisive change in her career trajectory. The structural logic holds, linking the surreal epiphany directly to real-world action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative lens works beautifully here, stacking visions to build toward a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's state. Orientation is immediate and grounding. The closure—achieving sleep through the completion of the ritual—is an Earned Stasis that feels causally valid within the established magical realism, though the external "smog thinning" mirrors the internal state a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The transition from the inciting discovery (lens fractures) to the community resolution is efficient and fits the short form. However, the resolution relies on a rapid pivot where the physical challenge (melting a monumental waterfall) yields somewhat easily to the thematic solution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal line: preparation, opportunity (tide), action (spin), and consequence (transcendence). The closure is a definitive Decisive Change where the protagonist exits the narrative frame, with the cost being the loss of the known world. The logic of the magic system holds up within the established rules of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal chain, but the &quot;dream dictionary&quot; functions as a *deus ex machina* instruction manual that dissolves tension rather than complicating it. Closure is achieved, but the low dramatic cost makes the resolution feel tidy rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, effectively utilizing the established mechanics of the copper-wired trees to resolve the plot. Closure is achieved through a successful maneuver, but the "cost" is primarily conceptual (trusting the unseen) rather than a felt sacrifice or irreversible change, leading to a somewhat neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is clean, establishing the "whistle" mechanics early to earn the climax where the turtle shifts. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that validates her theory, though the "Council’s dismissal" serves as a convenient off-screen setup rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Structure is coherent and the scene is complete, but the causal link between the argument and the resolution is weak; the "deadline" (petal) frames the scene but doesn't add on-page pressure to the negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure works well, using the routine of the tide and the notes to build toward the discovery of the box. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from inventing memories to witnessing real ones deepens the stakes effectively. The coincidence of the box appearing is forgiven as it complicates his mission.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal chain where the blackout necessitates the method that leads to the discovery. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting her role from passive cataloger to active participant. A minor convenience—locating the exact page in the dark immediately—slightly weakens the investigative causality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a strong Accumulative lens, using the process of the craft to structure the emotional arc. The backstory of the bribe is integrated smoothly without stalling momentum. Closure is an excellent example of Earned Stasis: the release of the crane doesn't magically fix the problem, but crystallizes Mei's resolve to continue the labor ("Eight hundred and fifty-two cranes remained"), landing with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    The framing device of the cooling circuit breakers creates a neat structural loop, but the narrative arc is static; Mira seeks validation and finds it without significant obstacle or reversal. The causal link between atmospheric physics and human grief relies on metaphorical fiat rather than narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative functions as a prologue rather than a complete story; it consists of an arrival, an explanation, and an acceptance of a mission. There is no complication, obstacle, or failure point to test the protagonist. The ending lacks closure with cost, offering only a promise of future action ("She would bring it home").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies heavily on summarized backstory in the first half to establish stakes, delaying the present action. Elias’s arrival on a "forgotten shore" reads as a convenient coincidence rather than a causally earned encounter, and the resolution comes too easily given the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the resolution relies on a prepared speech rather than an emergent tactical shift. The closure is a "success" ending with no visible cost; the tension ("What if they run?") evaporates instantly upon her explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    The arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident and legible closure that reconfigures Marina's stance. The pacing is effective, though the transition from refusal to acceptance is relatively quick and smoothed over by dialogue rather than a forced tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on a static dialogue block to deliver the time traveler backstory, stalling momentum. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it hinges on an external anecdote rather than a pressure cooker created by the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is efficient and causality is tight; the connection between the spices, the magic, and the transformation is logical within the world's rules. The closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change with an unmistakable cost (loss of humanity) that resonates with the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, utilizing the three-card reading as a structural ladder to escalate pressure. Closure is decisive and resonant; the protagonist abandons the magical solution for a mundane one, creating a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of her values. The cost—the admission that the ritual was an escape, not a fix—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent with excellent orientation to the "twilight" setting. The closure is a legible Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration, though the causal path is smoothed significantly by the lack of effective opposition, making the resolution feel somewhat inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence (the surveyor's timely arrival) and supernatural intuition to resolve the scene, lacking a causal chain or escalating pressure. The closure, while conceptually clear, lacks a visible on-page cost; the primary sacrifice (her fortune) is relegated to backstory, leaving the ending feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a pre-established plan, lacking significant obstacles or twists. While the closure (distribution of the sundials) is clear and causally linked to the blackout, the absence of an antagonist or complication makes the progression feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conceit of a frictionless world is applied inconsistently; while eels glide and water doesn't crash, Korin is able to "kneel" and handle rocks without sliding, which breaks the established physical rules. The closure (a Conceptual Repricing of "letting go") works emotionally, but the path there feels structurally predetermined by the visions rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative drive works well, anchored by the rhythmic constraint of the darkroom timer. The closure lands as a solid Earned Stasis, with the bus timetable plan providing just enough forward causality to validate her persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and legible, with a clear inciting threat (the duel) and a distinct resolution (collaboration). The causal chain holds, though the ease with which the central conflict is deferred lowers the sense of structural weight. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of their relationship—lands effectively, even if the stakes feel somewhat low.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of planting seeds for a future self who won't recognize them creates a poignant "Earned Stasis." The narrative drive is Accumulative, deepening the meaning of the setting and relationship without forced external plot turns. The brief expository paragraph regarding the "blooming resistance" slows momentum slightly but anchors the scope effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the mechanism of resolution—splicing film to create a temporal map—operates on dream logic that resolves the central conflict too easily. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" (the husband returns) without the required felt or conceptual cost to anchor the closure in reality. The stakes are high, but the obstacle dissolves instantly upon her action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from skepticism to decision within the tight constraints of the monsoon deadline. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (planting the seed); however, the immediate validation of the "hum" slightly undercuts the felt cost of the choice. Leaving the result ambiguous would have heightened the weight of "luminous doubt" and the risk Kima took in breaking her oath.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is legible and orientation is solid, but the narrative relies on "talking heads" exposition to advance. The closure—a moment of realization—feels conceptually coherent but unearned by the protagonist's on-page struggle; the lace-reading mechanic is accepted too easily, bypassing necessary causal grounding.

    Causal lens holds: entry → cast study → Reeves call → decryption → authority call forms tight because/therefore chain narrowing options. Closure via Conceptual Repricing in final image (truth "clutched in both hands") lands with relational cost (Reeves' broken trust voiced on-page). Orientation anchored early in library entry.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating silences tightening to Charged Poise closure where commander's understanding of absence-map reconfigures navigation; orientation anchored early in arrival at fort; cost legible in "something like navigation began" amid total dark.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Helena locks the greenhouse while holding a slide of scales that reframes her life’s metric from billion-ton stars to “tiny mirrors” of lost flight. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust density, pattern recognition, cadence shift—rather than causal reversal; the final image reweights the stake without tidy epiphany. Cost is legible: she accepts next spring’s restart knowing it too can drown. Mosaic shard count is within Track B; transitions are legible, pattern taught by 25 %.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: ledger strip ➔ cave gunpowder ➔ confrontation ➔ exchange for clemency; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the kiln-light reframes ‘fire’ from weapon to art, but the cost of Vera’s clemency is asserted, not dramatized—no legal jeopardy or social consequence appears on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike layers thermal pattern upon pattern until the final book of maps becomes a Conceptual Repricing—silence literally framed as music. Causality is lyric rather than plotted, but the because/therefore is felt: “she struck / color bloomed / visitors wept,” a tightening cadence that forecloses the option of ever reclaiming her old voice. Cost is indelible: the ocean keeps what it took, yet the closing image of the fork pressed to her heart reweights survival itself as a new frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: package arrival → dreams → recognition of liminal dead → decision to descend → restoration → release. Each beat is a because/therefore link; the decisive moment—“You can rest now”—carries visible cost as Marcel rises “already falling asleep,” relinquishing the library he just rebuilt. No orientation debt; transitions (boat→bell→library) are legible. Closure reconfigures meaning: death as relocation now has an address, and Marcel’s exhaustion is the price.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: sanctions → hunger → midnight runs → anonymity’s limit → public declaration → communal pledge to inherit the bell. The arbor gathering is a decisive change that forecloses Mara’s invisible role; cost is legible in her exposed vulnerability. One minor causality bump: the network’s continental reach is asserted rather than shown, but it does not break the closure lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the camera’s inverted image reveals the golden threads of “unused love” braided into the world, re-weighting the premise with conceptual cost (she relinquishes the heirloom). Causality is accumulative/textural: each bloom and spark adds density until the reconfiguration crystallizes. Orientation is immediate (twilight viaduct by line 3). No lens ambiguity; the final image repackages earlier motifs rather than explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each photograph dissolution increases density rather than causal sequence, culminating in a Charged Poise where mazes become temporal bone-structure. Orientation is swift—bridge-ravine-fragment anchored by line 3. The reversal (photos gone, garden rewired) is on-page with conceptual cost: her past is now literally un-walled. One minor warp: “tomorrow or yesterday” is repeated motif, not fresh tightening; the beat still lands but the cadence flickers.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she decoded the bench, therefore she locates the arrow; because the wall falls, therefore she slips away. One meaningful tightening—decoding the keys—narrows options and triggers the decisive change. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of her kneeling to plant seeds reweights freedom into stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor dip: the arrow’s evidentiary power is declared more than dramatized, so cost is felt but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Motive-to-action chain is airtight: because her daughter’s silence wounds, Mira harvests cheek cells, imprints memory, hears the gray-fraying tone, and therefore chooses release. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (collecting absences) and tightens through the aurora-lit forge beat until the crystalline drop reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: options collapse, cost felt in the forge glow and possible daughter “ghost-shift.” Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity or off-stage shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: stolen jar → impossible self-portrait → recognition that she is the subject, not the thief → renunciation of theft and embrace of creation. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya walks out owning a new vocation, the cost being the forfeiture of her old identity. The moonbeam vision pays off the set-up; no teleporting props or soft resets appear.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/texture lens holds: each circling of the rod, each echo of river-ice cracks, thickens the pattern until the bookmark pocketing flips the emotional valence. Closure is Charged Poise—sphere lifted to light, option to reconnect crystallized, cost = years of silence acknowledged. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no prop or knowledge teleport. Single tightening sufficient for length; causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: cast → decryption → expose; the library exit with shell in hand delivers a clean Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her identity mission.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the commander’s silent acceptance of a map drawn from absences is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with felt cost. The pattern of three silences is taught early and pays off in the final cadence, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens rules. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words; the deliberate early disorientation of “only one star” later charges the closure image, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each loop adds density to the violin’s meaning until the melody rewrites his own code in mid-air. Orientation is clean—frozen courtyard, twilight, fourth loop—by line 3. The closing image (janitor playing his own diagnostics audible) is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise: consciousness is maintenance across time, not a locate-able chip. Cost is felt in the perpetual loop he now accepts; no escape is offered, only endless sweeping and sounding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lens set aside, hands taken, silence chosen—cost is the foreclosed safety of cryptic distance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each doodle, overheard shard, and prismatic refraction layers density until the final image reweights the premise. The single-scene orientation is anchored by line 3; no orientation debt. One minor scaffold: “the resonant hush” is used twice in the last paragraph—does not blur the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze’s impossible bloom/rot reweights the entire luck premise without a single decimal. Causal lens holds—every because/therefore links Marcus’s score to the vine-dresser’s counter-experiment. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Cost is visible in the dying wisteria that opens for her but not for him—constraint that will persist after page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final image of Kael calibrating while knowing “time moves sideways” reconfigures their identity and the station’s mission with felt conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—each magnetic nexus adjustment is a because/therefore step toward the lateral-time reveal; no convenient resets. The persistent constraint (mechanic’s subordinate role) shapes tactics and is visible in the last line, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marta’s whisper and the lanterns’ calm dimming crystallize her new, irreversible role as Constance’s witness. Causal chain holds—each musical note tests the ghost, the program’s stains literally lift into the word TELL, forcing the photo and the vow. One minor scaffold: “water-damaged program showed a pattern” is summary; a 0.1 dock keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Driven by Causal lens: fever-break → discovery of smothered doubt → code rewrite that enshrines uncertainty. The moment Mira pulls up “marginal notes” is the decisive turn; the new oracle’s first advisory supplies visible cost (“conditions uncertain, recommend caution”). Orientation is anchored by line 4; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s epistemic rule-set is permanently altered, with the price being perpetual incompleteness—felt in the final image of clouds that can now only be read hesitantly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final rush of water and “shift change” audibly lifts decades of compressed guilt, cost felt in the audible emptying of the tunnel. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beaded wheel and radio call layers density until the ambient ghost-shift becomes the moral payload. Causality remains intact: Marcus’s turns → audible release. One hairline slip: the psychic-caller conduit is explained post-fact, not motivated early; barely grazes the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each image layers decay until the library and keeper meld. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—her calcifying bones add the final archive—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are implied early by texture rather than exposition, satisfying the waiver. No causality breaks; the origami swan’s late rule is taught one beat before payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of Mara packing her guitar while planning next week’s wind-chime session reconfigures her earlier doubt into forward motion, cost felt in the empty loft where the echo of Thomas’s voice still hangs. Causal lens dominates: eclipse → hum → first words → reorientation of therapist’s stance; each beat is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“edge of town where the pines…”) and repeatedly re-anchored through sensory cues (cooling air, falling birdsong). No teleporting props; the curl, guitar, and eclipse glasses remain tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tapestry’s claw re-weighted by Catherine’s diaries reconfigures meaning with felt conceptual cost—“someone needed to remember.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of salvaged objects → reprise at mount. Orientation clear by line 5; no caps triggered. Micro-turn (dragon-claw/shield ID) is the single tightening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final sweep of the beam reweights forty years of secrets into public benedictions; cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the lighthouse will keep sending “everything and nothing” messages, tying Maya to eternal vigil. Causal chain holds: dead contact → microdot under stool → fortune-cipher → UV-sealed cookie → lamp confirmation; each step is because/therefore. One micro-turn—realizing the beam itself is drop-box—tightens options without soft reset. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lens is accumulative/textural: layered loops and blue daubs intensify pattern until the entity dissolves. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—stillness reframed as fullness—yet the cost is borne by the off-page entity, not the protagonist, muting resonance. Orientation is clear within 120 words, transitions are smooth, and the mandala completion supplies the decisive image, but the absence of any price paid by Calloway keeps the beat just shy of high-band excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored horizon → nautilus → invented notation; each layer adds density rather than causal turn, culminating in Charged Poise—she departs “ready to write fortunes that sang,” options re-priced, cost legible. Orientation clean by ¶3; one seamless timespan; no prop drift. The tightening is single but decisive: translation replaces prediction, foreclosing the old commercial self. Could top 8.5 if a sharper physical price (hand blood on page? ice burn?) had been foregrounded at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “She was here, now, whole” crystallizes the dominant lens (Accumulative/Textural) by reweighting self-unity over omnipresence. Persistent constraint—ordinary gravity—returns as felt cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: “viaduct… dying sun… ancient mortar.” Causality across mosaic shards is pattern-taught (“retrace” repeated, rune-map revealed) so lens holds. Minor bump: tablet’s instant crumble feels slightly convenient, but dust moment is tied to final image and thus forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the broken needle’s shadow “like a sound wave frozen in time” reweights the entire premise—defeat becomes victory via absence. Causal chain holds: needle → reverse-recording → filament of hush → conservatory acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs when reversed tracks carve audible silence, foreclosing standard pedagogy. Cost is unmistakable: Oskar’s deafness is permanent, his method now irreversibly silence-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she finds the tube, therefore the woman approaches; because she has mapped lateral pulses, therefore she is recruited. Closure is Earned Stasis—she keeps recording under the violet shimmer, path foreclosed with felt cost (“the world reorganized itself…”). Orientation anchor (who/where) lands by line 4; no teleporting props. One causality nip: the satchel of tubes appears without prior cue, but it enables rather than resolves, so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory deprivation layer (empty greenhouse, silent vial, colorless air) accretes until the ultraviolet reveal reweights loss into visible love. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“The greenhouse smelled of nothing…”) and the single transition into the lab is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren re-corks a now-“filled” vial, accepting a new spectrum of grief; the conceptual cost is the permanent substitution of light for scent, legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a CR: the rope left glowing re-prices the entire premise—objects now preach transcendence. Accumulative lens holds: each temporal layer in the rope tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (he forfeits the relic to become its next voice). Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught by 25 % and lands. No orientation debt; star-thread and grotto anchors arrive by line 8.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each fragment layers sensory density until the hush is “slightly” repelled. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp within 60 words; no penalty. Closure—Charged Poise—arrives with the falling-apple splash that reweights silence as “potential,” satisfying RR. Cost is present but diffuse (shared grief, environmental loss) rather than a price Maya personally forfeits; the bowl drink is collective ritual, not consequence of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the petal handed over carries a revised half-truth whose cost is conceptual—the client will receive gentler self-deception, yet Mara concedes her own former absolutism. Causal chain holds: amber insight → petal revision → handing it over. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3. The cost is abstract rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8+ gate. Lens is cleanly Situational: stance crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is present: a Resonant Reconfiguration in which recognition becomes Marianne’s new currency, signaled by the lighthouse keeper’s near-tears and the star-wheeled final image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each small documentation act layers density until the premise is repriced. Cost is conceptual—Marianne’s time and her altered metric of worth—but not viscerally felt on the page; the final line’s cosmic frame is lovely yet bloodless. The pattern is taught early and held; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the twin arbors breathe light while Kael sings back—an undeniable image of inclusion with felt emotional cost. Causal chain holds: each tag is a because/therefore step that pulls her closer until the sculpture forces the final stance. The single transition (orchard→marsh→crater edge) is legible; no orientation debt. One hairline slip: the communal lift-and-install is compressed into two sentences, barely shortchanging the labor cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: she borrows time → sees caged echo → uncages → frees it; each because/therefore link is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the uncaging reweights her vocation from capture to release, cost shown in the pendant’s spent glow. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (rooftop canals, seven-hour clock). No teleporting props; the pendant, jars, and charcoal reappear on schedule. One soft spot: the mentor’s fevered hint is off-stage backstory used to authorize the quest—minor causality blur.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the parallel orchard image reweights the premise—loss is not a void but a co-existent garden—leaving the cost (perpetual search without reunion) legible in the final line “growing toward its own mysterious proof.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight → dripping rhythm → glass-eye gleam → blossom opening is a density chain that culminates in the double vision, not a causal puzzle to solve. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are fixed by line 10; no penalty. No teleporting props; the glass eyes warm in her hand, a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the sequential discovery and donation of tapes steadily reweights Miriam’s private archive into public memory; closure is a Charged Poise—she remains unseen yet her absence is now generative. Causality holds: each reel she caches and then anonymously gifts tightens the library’s recovered self-knowledge while foreclosing her own emergence. The final image (“the crawl space dweller had become a keeper…”) crystallizes the trade-off with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases via recurring storms, leaves, moss until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the released leaf spirals down, visually repricing her former need to possess knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. Causality holds: each storm thickens the texture of surrender; the mossy trellis she once meant to scrape away becomes the site of final poise. Cost is legible in the tactile loss of the pressed-leaf archive and the open-ended storms ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the rain-trail pattern and brooch converge in a Conceptual Repricing—memory replaces mysticism, insomnia becomes communion. Causality is loose (Accumulative/Textural lens): rain → brooch → prints → insight; no reversal, but density and cadence reweight the stake. Orientation is swift; only one transition (studio→cave) and geography stay coherent. Cost is felt in the final canvas/image rather than a lost option, meeting the CR bar.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s new song reweights every prior prophecy as theft; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of the pearl’s darkness re-tunes the cave’s music—and the price (irreversible loss of sight) is on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive door opening spills seventeen years of attention into light, making the conceptual cost of her vigil undeniable. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each fragment she hoarded accretes until it can only discharge as gift. The valve’s return supplies the single tightening required; no reversal is needed. Orientation is secure by line 5; the only minor drag is a too-summarized handshake between the two exiles.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s name carved in the fortress wall forces her to redraw her maps, reweighting her prior “rational” cartography; the cost is the irreversible knowledge of her own suppressed truth. Causal chain holds: crack-arrows → conductor’s validation → tunnel → fortress → new map. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (station clock, platform, headlamp). Lens is Causal throughout. No meaningful escalation break; single tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tile reconfigures from curiosity to inherited responsibility, reweighting Elena’s worldview with undeniable social and epistemic cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each woman’s layer adds density until the pattern breaks into a new stance. The final image of her writing in the open tower crystallizes Charged Poise: options narrowed, legacy accepted, sky still open. Persistent constraint: the tower’s roofless architecture now mirrors her irrevocable exposure to the whales’ unheard symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Cassius’s vow to reopen the wound he just witnessed carries undeniable relational cost under the Causal lens. Each beat obeys because/therefore logic—fragment arrives → dimensional mutiny detected → Naia reveals her plan → storm peak offers gap → she steps through → he decides to follow. Spatial anchors (prismatic escondite, obsidian desk, window) are in place by line 60; no orientation debt. One minor slack: “ritual that works even on half-immortals” is off-stage granted, not causally seeded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: ink pot recognition → documentation → Jacobson upstairs → father confronted → treatment offer. The mid-scene reveal that asylum documents are already forged tightens options; closure lands as Earned Stasis—Vincent’s freedom traded for rehab, cost legible in his tears. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lamp-hum and botanical distortion thickens the texture of time until the final “charged poise” under the proportionate oak reweights the premise—she will lie even at the zero-degree of truth. The closure image carries unmistakable conceptual cost: “Only the beautiful untruths require gilded leaves.” Orientation is clear by word 80; no causal break occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each container fragment layers density until the poison label breaks the pattern and re-weights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maya hands over the notebook, foreclosing her nameless refuge while the tide literally laps at the metal; the cost is the relinquishment of the only identity that still fit her. No causal cheats: the clerical error is off-stage, but its after-image is relentlessly tracked on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“port city’s forgotten edge”); disorientation is taught early and pays off in the final container-gaps purple light.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each musical note layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Closure—Mira packs the shell, accepts living inside the question—lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable emotional cost (“tears,” “unfinished”). Orientation anchors inside 120 words (twilight through cracked dome). Persistent constraint: the cello remains unfinishable, shaping her final gesture. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the raft city’s “endless, defiant dance” reconfigures options—Marina recommits to motion, not stasis, with the stone’s weight now a conscious burden. Causal chain holds: gentrification threat → encoded graffiti → reclaimed platforms → renewed welcome ritual. Orientation is swift; only two reflective paragraphs exceed 20 % but each toggles present action (speedboat wake, chip in pocket) so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: hourglass grain → revealed inscription → re-framed goal → chemical timer → simultaneous collapse/photo. Closure (Charged Poise) lands in the crystallized frame where grain + flowers + dust are super-imposed; cost is legible in the irreversible loss of mountain and species. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (safe-zone retreat) is legible. Minor slack: ninety-minute countdown declared but not exploited to tighten beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the drone mis-reads refraction, therefore Mara must re-calibrate; because she patches it, Voss can sail. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her “different kind of light” speech crystallizes the premise and forecloses her ever rejoining the sighted world. Cost is visible in the final image: she turns back to three more broken drones, the queue of damage endless. No orientation debt; depot, mist, horn anchors arrive by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a solid Charged Poise: Mira steps onto the ice in full knowledge that the lake will “know” and the atlases will burnish her discovery, so meaning is re-weighted with embodied risk; the cost is the solitude and the outpost left behind. Causal chain runs cleanly: because the ice has retreated, because she edited discrepancies, therefore she now drills—no convenient amnesia. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 5. Mosaic design (two shards) is taught early and holds. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; condensation pattern provides the single intensifier that escalates and crystallizes at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed bell crystallizes the town’s restored resonance, cost paid by years of silence and the tacit price of perpetual communal walking. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of footsteps → harmonic density → crack seals. Orientation is clean; archway, bell tower, and timeline anchor within first 120 words. No causal break; the magical repair is seeded by the tuner’s repeated fork-to-stone tests.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every ascent meter tightens because/therefore linkage—oxygen alarm → vial pocketed → temple last look → surface light—each step forecloses the last. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial still pulses, but the choice to seal it reconfigures both scientists’ future tactics with felt conceptual cost (“we’re choosing to forget we ever knew”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. Persistent constraint—the vial’s addictive gravity—shapes the final image and is never neutralized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: lattice → corridor → impossible chamber → offer → acceptance, each link motivated by the prior. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Matthias forfeits mundane reality to join the “hush,” a price legible in the image of boots sealing the wing forever. The missing-prisoner mystery is not explained away but reconfigured into ontological migration, satisfying the fairytale-logic promised early.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: bead hum leads to door, soil burial leads to dawn. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse… winter-cracked fields”). Closure is a Decisive Change—night becomes morning, apples ripen, ghost released—paid for by the bead’s burial and ancestral forgiveness. Cost is legible in the lost relic and the irrevocable shift from eternal night to daylight; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared and held: each night’s overlay of thread thickens meaning until the final sunrise image reweights the whole. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“broken precedents became new traditions”—with undeniable social cost: the monks’ rule is publicly voided. The illustration plate acts as taught pattern early and returns charged at the end, satisfying the payoff requirement. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: Earned Stasis—Miriam renounces departure and commits to tending the inter-rooted dead/living bridge. Cost is visible in the final image (apple blossom pressed between palms, sacramental gesture that accepts perpetual caretaking). Causal chain holds: sundial base → tomb discovery → grandmother’s pattern learned → adoption of that pattern. One soft spot: the decisive “I will stay” beat occurs off-page between sunset walk and blossom ritual; had it been folded into the final image the tightening would have carried sharper punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the dawn-gilded arcade, mailbox 47B, and disappearing chalk drawings thicken texture until the envelope drops re-weight authenticity itself. Orientation arrives by line 6; no causal gaps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the letter gone, Iris walks into smog-thick uncertainty—cost is the irreversible exposure felt in the brass snap of the slot. The persistent constraint (surveillance-forced secrecy) is what makes analog mail radical, tightening every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: flame modulation → decrypted coordinates → embroidery → courier choice → final knock. Each beat tightens options; the dawn-time guttering is the irreversible pivot that forces her to commit the chart to cloth now. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5 and never drift. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth’s silver constellations reweight all prior “nonsense” into actionable intelligence, and the cost—Mirelle’sExposure without escape—hits on the final whispered prayer.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: “because the letter was never sent, therefore the shard must reopen the moment before choice.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—client re-weights her own past, cost is the unchangeable death, felt when the shard is pressed to her chest. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening: the condensation messages appear → choice to send the letter to her past-self. No causal breaks; persistent constraint is the irreversibility of death.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coral’s “ancient convolutions” reweight the entire premise—translation is now a geological, not merely linguistic, act—while the cost (truth may not heal, only endure) is felt in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog → anesthetic → coral accrete meaning until the last line reconfigures stakes without a causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer of fog, phosphorescent paint, and fragment-glow adds density until the climax reweights joy as medium not message. Orientation anchor (“Mara lived…”) arrives by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the studio wall blazing crystallizes her new stance and forecloses the old hollow style; the cost is the irrevocable exposure of her new vision to the neighbors. Persistent constraint—perpetual fog—shapes every tactic; lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena refuses to seal the discovery, accepting unquantifiable professional cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each layer reweights her stance rather than forcing causal reversals. Pattern is taught by 25% (sound-garden → mural vibration → nested image) and coheres in the final breathing fresco. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props or causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise: butterflies swirl, seventeen minds bloom in extinct tongues, and the image reweights the premise—thoughts now carry embodied non-parseable cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold. Escalation is pattern-based: each gourd signal, garden cipher, and butterfly vortex layers density until the final rattle releases the cadence shift; no causal reversals required. Cost is conceptual but legible: membership permanently exiles them from taxable citizenship.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of nacre-like poems tightens the stake of “can longing itself be enough?” Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn light reframes the shell into a cathedral of ongoing labor, cost felt in the phrase “she began again.” Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: centuries foregone, the poem’s spiral now her only biography.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked chime becomes the new archive, reweighting the entire premise. Causal chain—crack → song → mother → renunciation → re-hanging—lands with conceptual cost: the museum now conserves damage itself. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at “she would not repair it” tightens stakes. Cost is on-page: the broken voice will keep singing, a perpetual reminder of chosen imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: the ink → confession → Varesh self-authenticating grammar → Marcus’s aloud test → rapprochement forms an unbroken because-chain. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“subterranean vault”) and the clock (“within the hour”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the intact spoken paragraph proves honesty and reconfigures their future with the visible cost of imminent separation. The Varesh rule is persistent and constrains every tactical sentence she writes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: tampered letter → arrival → discovery of locked floodgates → unsealed report forces collaboration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her unsealed envelope crystallizes new social rules with undeniable conceptual cost. The火山-amphitheater breathing is metaphorical yet internally consistent, paid off in the final exhalation that harmonizes contradictions. Orientation is secured within 120 words with concrete anchors (steps, chain, humidity).

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s placing the meteorite reweights her rule-set—she forecloses flight, accepts seasonal withering. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the dust/meteorite pattern intensifies until the final image charges earlier motifs with cost. One micro-loop—“she continued her work, balancing…”—repeats the balancing image without new pressure, a hairline drag.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara writes PRESNT beside BECMG, renaming her father’s weather code into lived presence; the cost is the lifetime she spent carrying the logbook and the future she now surrenders by refusing to “cross.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every shard adds density to thresholds, grain, and codes until the final image reweights love as distance kept, not bridged. Orientation is taught early (“the terrace drifted…”) and paid off in the prism shimmer at the end; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city is alive and conversation is possible, re-weighting the entire research premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition thickens until the “fireflies” image crystallizes the new frame. Causality is soft (no hard sequence from data to proof) but coherent under the lyric-drive contract established by the singed-feather omen. Cost is present but diffuse: the unwritten rule that to “join” means evacuation from objective study is implied, not sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crater-glass reveals reality’s pruning shear and Marina’s notebook now holds the emotional weight of non-existence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each drop adds density until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable cost (“so we can bear the weight of the ones we actually walk”). Orientation is swift, transition is clean, and the albatross-seed pattern taught early pays off in the final line. Causality remains intact: because she pours, she sees; because she sees, she writes; because she writes, she accepts the tide’s erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the unplanned job offer re-weights Mara’s rule-set (Conceptual Repricing) and carries felt opportunity cost—she must surrender pure control. Causal lens holds: every performer placement leads to the engineered “pocket of beauty,” yet the decisive turn (Rebecca’s counter-attack and offer) arises from Mara’s over-extension, not scheme. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (boardwalk, kelp, four-hour window). Non-closure niggle: the mentor’s italicized aphorism arrives late without prior seed; a small echo-loop on “wilderness” phrases (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “gaps” and crystalline imagery taught early and re-weighted at the end when her body becomes the final text. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands in hieroglyph, galaxies in her eyes—conceptual cost legible: exile is now irreversible, her body the last scroll. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but the moonstone dissolve is the single because/therefore pivot that locks the verse into flesh. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no prop teleport; lyrical elision is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Martin walking back “where the harbor was beginning to show its colors” reweights his earlier hollow routine into charged poise, cost legible in the refusal to linger. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light/rings/mist accrues meaning until the cadence shift at the pond edge; no causal antagonist needed. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (place, time, who). No meaningful escalation cap triggered; single tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal arc—because he survived the girl, therefore he bears scars, therefore he treks to release the box—culminates in Decisive Change: he will take leave. Closure lands with visible cost (scars, cracked box, forfeited fire-tower identity). Orientation anchored by ~70 words; no lens ambiguity; no artifact at ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through mirrored pattern-making across timelines until the final overlay collapses divergence into Charged Poise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the gauge’s freed needle reweights “fall” as “flight,” with undeniable conceptual cost (she abandons the instrument that defined her). Causality is maintained because each decorative placement is a micro-test whose failure accumulates into the final insight; no late rule changes. Orientation is clean—grotto, tide, night locked by word 80—and the mosaic of three shards is taught early and paid off in the harmonic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens governs: each sensed echo thickens the pattern until the final image of “ivy exhaled” reweights what “dreaming with walls” costs. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya accepts lifelong entanglement, cost crystallized in the satchel’s weight and the passage’s breath. Orientation swift within 120 words; no set-up left unpaid. One minor scaffold (“She returned…with renewed purpose”) could trim, but rhythm recovers before final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrors’ new protocol (“what else could you be?”) is legible and carries civic cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each painted mirage and sung lullaby layers until the bell-crescendo releases the code into the city. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4 and the prism parapet recurs to refract both light and meaning, satisfying the waiver test. One soft spot: the Council’s motive is declared, never pressure-tested on the page, so the stakes’ urgency is inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the clipboard, once bureaucratic prop, becomes sacred repository whose gravity forces an imperfect treaty. Causal chain holds: name-reading → emotional rupture → narrowed negotiation options. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; single scene, no teleporting props. The felt cost is collective, but Maren’s personal price remains off-page, keeping it just shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the drought-engineer frees the rain he monetized, and the salt map of his own making dissolves beneath him. Causal logic holds because the bird-shaped crack pattern he earlier imposed becomes the stage on which he sacrifices the egg; the release act is legible as both penance and reclamation. Cost is visible—“salt dissolving beneath his feet”—simultaneously wiping out his geo-signature and announcing the end of his scarcity business model. One micro-turn is sufficient for this length; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism sanctuary explodes and releases trapped voices, reweighting the palace’s rule-set and Celestine’s identity. Causal chain holds: each untangled thread tightens stakes until the final pull collapses the web—visible, sonic, irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Cost is on-page: she laughs amid falling crystal shrapnel, conducting a now-audible rebellion. Minor time-skip “three nights ago” is cleanly cued; does not break continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each puppet rehearsal thickens thematic texture until the final cadence shift reweights “half-lit epiphanies.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the dome’s expectant hush reconfigures meaning—but the cost is more metaphorical (artistic ethic) than visceral, nudging it below 8. Orientation is clean; we know who/where by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the final monarch landing on her shoulder reweights the rule-set—ephemeral witness is enough. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of butterflies + dissolving tower make the cost legible without exposition. Persistent constraint (season-long lifespan) shapes every knot. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props; one legible transition (sunset → darkness).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bells ring once for her, then stay as wind-borne guardians—cost is the unkeepable sound she walks away from. Causal chain holds: forgiveness → access to sanctum → rope re-braiding → bronze pour → voices externalized. Aurora-ice-rope-bronze pattern is taught by 25 % and re-weights the ending; no orientation debt. Micro-turn at “she could finally work” tightens options cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decaying directive dissolves into the insight that path and walker co-create, a reweighting legible on the page (“choice and destiny weren’t opposites but partners”). The accumulative lens holds: each wafer seal adds density until the pattern crystallizes. Orientation is swift, causality is interior but coherent, and the final image carries unmistakable conceptual cost—she stays to become another crystal in the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    A single causal chain carries discovery → decoding → alignment dig; each step grows from the last with no lucky rescues. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the treatise’s unearthing reweights her frugality into intellectual lineage, felt cost legible in her exhausted weeping. Orientation is clear by word 70 (“palace ruins at dusk”), easily inside the 120-word allowance. Only minor slack: the second tile’s resonance is forecasted rather than foreshadowed, so the final beat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Kale’s acceptance re-weights the broken pin from wound to necessary gap, a felt cost paid on the page. Causal chain holds—broken pin → missing note → resentment as structural absence → acceptance reinstates pin, song, agency. The 120-word orientation test is waived: deliberate disorientation (soundless text, floating memories) is taught by line 4 and paid off when Kale re-experiences her brother’s mitochondrial truth. No teleporting props, no retro-patching; the music-box logic is planted early and drives the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant-mended arc becomes the literal bridge across the dissolved boundary, and the fog’s shift from erasure to illumination pays off the core risk. Causal linkage holds—every beat of silver-paste breathing pulls the lost instrument and the lost brother into alignment. The cost is felt in the cold fire that still burns on the restored arc, proving the crossing was not free.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The closure image—mother and daughter grinding quartz under falling blossoms—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly costs Marta her pride and Lena her silence. Causality is clean: cryptic letter → climb → stone discovery → co-grinding, each step shrinking the emotional distance. The drive lens is Causal; no orientation debt, though the contract breach is relayed in efficient exposition that still lands before the 120-word sweep. Closure cost is unmistakable in the hush of their joined labor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank shell reweights her life into a time-loop library with herself as both reader and author. Causal lens holds: because she bathes → she grasps temporal pages → therefore she selects the blank shell. Cost is legible—“whatever forbidden truth she would discover during her tenure between arrival and ending” foreshadows irreversible exposure. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each paragraph thickens the bookstore’s living lexicon until the “symphony” re-weights meaning at the end. Orientation declared by word 40; missing-books-as-map taught early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Marin’s offer reframes the bookstore from predator to exchange partner, and the diary pages begin self-writing as visible cost. Persistent constraint: the unheard frequencies remain, now composing outward rather than inward.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored shard and shifting word (“The garden remembers…”) deepens the same stake—can Mira keep her self intact? Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: by “pulling” one thread she accepts permanent cognitive entanglement; the fleet of ghost ships externalizes that cost, crystallizing a new, undeniable rule—she will drift forever among plural selves.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the re-braided rope reconfigures the university’s timelines and the door’s ontology—visible cost is the audible layering of impossible clock-rhythms that now include her edits. Causal chain holds: seal-map → braid-alteration → architecture rewrites itself. One soft spot: the “why her” gate is asserted rather than dramatized, but the lens (Causal) stays intact through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: because the surface is unbearable ∴ Kael descends; because he reads ripple-marks ∴ he finds the echo-stone; because he yields his own silence ∴ the bloom flowers. Closure lands as Charged Poise—stone glowing, village breathing in new spaces—cost visible in spent lantern and Kael’s solitary ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the future-echo of light blooming across ruins reweights earlier coincidences into constellation, with conceptual cost—she forfeits her tower isolation to become itinerant pattern-prover. Causal chain holds: prism break → star alignment → map of intersections → journey; each because/therefore is legible. Mosaic shards (temple, gallery, archive) are taught early via star-chart overlay; transitions are crystalline, not confusing. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative lens holds: crystalline memory-density increases until the pattern breaks into self-aware recursion. Anchors (who/where/when) are legible by line 40; the fog-architecture is taught early and pays off in the bridge the archivist herself becomes. Closure is a charged poise—Elden’s quill falling through cloud-light—whose conceptual cost (identity loss) is undeniable. The only drag is a mid-story expository paragraph summarizing the predecessor; trimming 15 words would tighten the escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine—“note in mosaic → arrival → revelation of failed artists → unlit spin → tear-streaked laughter”—tightens cleanly; each beat advances knowledge or option. Orientation (who/where/when) is secured within the first 90 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the unlit knot crystallizes the new stance and the lanterns re-weight failure into communal light. The “ambient awareness” rule is declared late and remains slightly abstract, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is clean Earned Stasis: Chen concedes his avoidance, Mira accepts partial repair, and the tide’s return images the lingering cost—options narrowed but not erased. Causal lens dominates; each beat (cicada reveal, pool metaphor, apology) is linked by because/therefore logic. Orientation anchored within 120 words (grotto, starlight, father-daughter standoff). No lens ambiguity at end; tide image re-prices the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira’s decision to remain aloft forecloses the bunker path with visible emotional cost (“the porcelain doll’s hollow chest pressed against her racing heart”). Causal chain holds: gravity inversion → lost vessels → doll recovery → symbolic release of maternal disappointment → choice of sky. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and again at “three miles high” (~70 words), well inside the 120-word window. Lens is causal; no ambiguity at payment moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystals’ fern pattern and the hush itself reconfigure Elena’s silence from trauma to continuity, with the gondola’s stasis as visible cost. Causality is intact—every beat is a calibrated deceleration that mirrors Elena’s breathing. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. The final “Always” is a promise whose price is Marco’s yearly return to this hush, legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stairway descends, not up, reframing “ascension” as submission to memory. Cost is felt—she forfeits daylight safety and official legitimacy. Causal chain is tight: mural → orchard → ruby → glass stairs; each because/therefore link narrows options. Orientation is clean by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the threshold dissolves, the girl crosses, and the final image reweights “emptiness” as oxygen. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern of burning/bridges/ash layers toward the crystallized moment. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. Lens holds, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no object lost, no breath actually fought for—so the reconfiguration is elegant yet lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: scam-backstory → glitch texts → volunteer yes → bolt seals breach → quantum diamonds. One tight micro-turn at the bolt-catch threads probability itself. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: "pressure...translated into something that could cut through any darkness" reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. No orientation drift; who/where/when clear by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new crime retroactively poisons the already-destroyed dynasty, tightening the noose of guilt. Causal chain—intuition → gramophone → acoustic encoding → confession—holds without teleport. Orientation anchors who/where by sentence three; no debt. One flaw: the legal ramifications are pronounced rather than shown, a miniature “explain-everything” shimmer that keeps this just under the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration: the knight accepts the strings by dancing beneath them, a visible renunciation of exile. Causal chain holds—program appears → remembered failure → patterned dance → armor dropped → strings felt—each step because-of the last. One minor causality fray: how a decades-old theatre flyer materializes inside a gauntlet he “checked obsessively” is brushed aside; at this length we accept the surreal premise. Orientation is clean by 120 words; perpetual-night greenhouse taught early and paid off in final lit stage.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Miriam’s decision to create a cross-referenced file crystallizes her new stance—permanent witness instead of private grief—charged by the brass button’s weight. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: dust patterns → hidden file → revelation → re-cataloguing. Cost is legible in the final line: “That would be enough” carries the forfeiture of personal repair. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (key → lagoon → puddle-map → vault) tightens her options because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vault hatch shuts, crystallizing permanent disappearance and foreclosing the “boring functionary” path. Cost is unmistakable—“she’d need to vanish more thoroughly”—and the persistent key/concealment constraint shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is not denied but absorbed into chosen silence, with the final image of “dewdrops catching muted light” making the conceptual cost legible; causal lens holds throughout—every prism color-shift follows directly from the anti-notes played; Orientation is secured by word 60 (“radiant grotto”), so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine holds: leaf pattern → curiosity → moonstone trigger → ability shift → purposeful building; each beat because/therefore advances her stance. Closure lands cleanly—“she had become the message”—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole quest; cost is legible in her irrevocable fusion with the arbor’s memorial purpose. Orientation is swift; world rules remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus chooses to “preserve fractures,” a stance crystallized in the final image of the freely spinning needle—felt cost is the forfeiture of conventional repair and the embrace of perpetual uncertainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building (broken clocks → compass → chamber map) reweights meaning rather than causal chain; the waterfall’s roar and the spinning needle together reconfigure the stake from “fix time” to “befriend uncertainty.” Orientation is anchored by word 50 (who, where, when), well under the 120-word allowance. No lens ambiguity at closure; price is unmistakable in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin remains broken yet sacred, shifting the magistrate from vigil to memorial and Mara from private guilt to public gift. Causal chain is tight—coin discovery → mercury/gold trial → naming ritual → fused fracture → candle in window—each step narrows options and raises emotional cost. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural: density of fire/rain/gold images reweights the meaning of “missing” without external plot turns. The cost is legible in the final image: candle lit “not in hopeless vigil” (textual line), a conceptual re-pricing that makes absence bearable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s integration is legible, the gorge’s echo transformed from guilt to shared laughter, and Kael’s tear-streaked face shows felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each warped harp note thickens the texture until the absurd memory breaks the loop. The lens holds; no causal contradictions. Minor waiver: orientation is complete by line 5, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mask laid down and the word “plant” crystallize a new rule-set—measure growth, not breakage—while the ultraviolet forest persists as a felt cost. Causal linkage holds: because she survived quantified pain, therefore she can now choose to quantify healing; the lens stays accumulative/textural and the final image reweights all prior Fibonacci counts.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rainbow-cast names reweight the city’s narrative authority, and the cost is the irreversibility of public exposure—legible if thin. Causality holds on an Accumulative lens: each shard of recovered memory adds density until the final exhibition crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single transition from market to studio is marked by nightfall. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (“spaces where cultures touched”) and paid off in the closing rainbow. Meets 9+ quick test except that the final cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s public promise repackages his lifelong “ceiling” obsession into ethical stewardship, felt cost in the quiet shift from demolition fee to guardian duty. Causal chain holds: ghost gesture → dust clue → box discovery → promise → fade; each step tightens options under the Causal lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit before word 90, well inside the 120-word guardrail. No teleporting props or retroactive knowledge; the mainspring’s inscription is new data, not a patch.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost-etched line and press-pull thickens pattern until the spin snaps the loop. Closure is a Charged Poise—the library’s rotation reframes every prior morning as falling, not floating, with conceptual cost paid in the final image. No causal gaps; the bottled whisper anchors motivation and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: baroque corridors, golden time-threads, and shard-refractions layer density until “brokenness itself architectural” reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—journal clutched, corridors “gleamed with burnished sorrow and stubborn hope”—felt cost is the perpetual visibility of time passing, making revolution obsolete. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: visible time-light keeps past failures literally glowing before him, shaping every later tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gold-shift of the stone fragment reweights the world rule-set with undeniable light-return. Causal chain (stone → rust-covenant → reversal) is clear; one tightening beat suffices, but the cost is conceptual, not embodied in Aldric’s future—he leaves unscarred.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lagoon receives her, the compass needle stilled, “pointing toward nothing and everything,” re-weighting every prior scent-sample and echo-reading. Causality is accumulative/textural—each sensory stratum deepens the stake until renunciation is the only cadence left. The 1903 Henrik through-line pays off the “delve” note and orients the reader without outline exposition. Cost is unmistakable: she breathes “primordial storms” and vanishes; the surface reader is left with the emptied vial and stilled compass.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s new aesthetic (revealing history in resin strata) crystallizes in the final image of the GPS ignored, older navigation embraced. Causal chain holds: storm → archway → slide → insight → altered artistic tactics → root-ball chosen; each beat layers density rather than reverses plot. Cost is felt in her deliberate abandonment of digital ease, the turbine-song now internalized. Minor clarity dip: “timewoven alliances” is named rather than dramatized, but the pattern of inscribed names on the slide teaches the concept early enough to waive any ambiguity cap.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon-rooted postcard reweights the premise, giving Mara a conceptual repaint with felt cost—her prior murals are now “wrong.” Causality is accumulative-textural; the layered glass metaphor and accumulating dusk images tighten the stake without a single reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalties. The lens holds, but the final beat is one beat short of a visible micro-choice that would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Malik’s decision to look charges the ending with irrevocable cost—“he would not look away” crystallizes the covenant under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation lands by ~100 words (zeppelin, dunes, diary). Causality is tight—diary → coordinates → descent → parley → transfer of memory burden. Only nudge: Sarai’s survival reveal is mildly convenient, not prefigured, but it complicates rather than solves, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the “architecture of potential” until the lanterns physically relight. Closure is a Charged Poise—lanterns glow by human hands, not magic—reconfiguring the stake from solitary vision to shared labor. Cost is legible: Miranda abandons the guild paradigm forever. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 3, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative design teaches its pattern early—wax shavings as emotional fossils—and holds to the finale. Orientation is clean by word 100; the twenty-year ellipsis is a single authorized transition. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus accepts the ledger, foghorn permanently silenced, cost legible in the weight of dead tongues he must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of uncertain sprout under clear glass reweights entropy and inheritance with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of texture→randomization→uncertainty—taught early and held to last line. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (frozen atrium, Mara center, acorn cap). No causal breaks; each beat adds density until the cadence shift at “the future was finally, blessedly uncertain.”

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Mara trusts rope vibration over sensors, therefore she overrides the board’s system, therefore the valley hears a human-tuned alarm before the freak storm. Closure is a Decisive Change—she pulls manual control, foreclosing her career path with felt cost as stone splinters. Orientation anchored by word 65; no penalty. The only micro-turn (instruments finally catch up) tightens rather than resets pressure. Persistent constraint: the rope’s older sensing technology shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early—“dust gathered even in the void’s edge”—and held to the Charged Poise closure where lantern-glow + meteor-streak reweight solitude as vocation. One meaningful tightening: the corporation’s bankruptcy auto-payments keep running, narrowing her exit to zero. Cost is legible in the final image: shadow/old self vs light/new self, foreclosing rescue. Micro-turn at “falling was just another form of flying” feels earned because the pattern of traced trajectories has been anchored in repeated tactile acts (mop, log, polish).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the letter read aloud reweights the covenant rule-set, ghosts visibly thin, Mara assumes custodianship of speech. Causal lens holds—because she speaks, the after-life prison dissolves. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits solitude and invites an unending duty. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the final image—meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each relic adds density until the final circle crystallizes a Charged Poise where “suddenly timeless hearts” carry literal fragments of fixed time; the urn shard’s return with reweighted meaning supplies visible, felt cost, so closure lands cleanly even though no causal turn narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy leaves with the damaged feather and Maren writes the line “wholeness wasn’t the goal,” reweighting her premise with felt cost (the boy’s loss remains, her journal stays fractured). Causality under Accumulative lens: snapped string → drake → feather → shared witnessing → reconfigured stance. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“cobalt lagoon,” “rainfall’s final curtain”). No teleporting props; the feather’s state is tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Maren’s last breath joins the orchard’s “ancient dialogue,” reconfiguring the stakes from human survival to collaborative continuation; the cost is the irreversible forfeiture of her remaining time and life. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each copper wrap and fungal transplant thickens the texture until meaning crystallizes in the final image. Causality holds: diary → remodel → orchard awakens → her death as gift. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3; no debt. A tiny lift: the six-month prognosis is declared but never visibly narrows her calendar or choices, so urgency is conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the invitation to walk tomorrow crystallizes the impossibility of return while making the attempt irresistible. Cost is felt in the rain washing away footprints—time’s erasure made visible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn walk layers density until the final image reweights “convergence” as perpetual loss. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the seeds “begin their work of reclamation” in darkness, making the submerged concord’s redemptive logic felt without sermon. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each scattering beat deepens the pattern until the final image reweights the whole. No orientation debt; twilight/jetty/coachman are anchored by line 3. Lens stays legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: Mercy’s nose → bunker → anomalous cylinder → night-long decoding → dawn coordinates → communal exodus. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (wasteland scrapyard, Calder, Mercy, post-war timeframe). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the leaf clipped to the pack re-weights “distance” from abstract lament to navigable map, cost felt in the weeping and the scratched-steel messages that can’t be unsent. One minor warp: the bunker’s sudden appearance is coincidence, but the story frames it as Mercy’s agency, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: temporal strata, compass rose, and anniversary sketching accrete into a resonant reconfiguration—Maya’s mapping of “when” rather than “where.” Closure lands cleanly in the last two sentences: her pencil scratch arrives out of order, crystallizing her eternal present with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: missing lid → return → coordinates → new mission; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepts the unknown with felt cost (“ready…to be an apprentice of all the beautiful, terrible mysteries”). Orientation is clean within 120 words (who, where, when anchored by brass sky and ice steps). One soft spot: the guardian’s line “You’ve come to amend what you broke” is slightly expository, but it pays off immediately in the chess placement, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the jointly walked testimony reweights what counts as “history.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each footstep is a density increment that finally reconfigures the archive’s meaning. Cost is unmistakable: Mira trades solitary witness for shared record, foreclosing her private language. Pattern taught early (footsteps as text) and paid off in the final image of two bodies tracing words beneath a dome that once listened to power.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bookstore re-shelves itself once she accepts the stone, refracting sunrise into nameless colors—undeniable conceptual cost under an accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate; place and POV are anchored by word 50. Causality is interior-pattern rather than event-sequence, taught early and held to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the village restarts, Petrov stays still—time’s resumption itself is the decisive change, felt cost is exile reframed as invitation. Causal lens holds: because he decodes “FORGIVE” in the weave, therefore he abandons descent into the maze, crystallizing new stance. Orientation anchored by line 4 (village square, suspended rain, seventeen-year stasis); no head-hop. Cost is legible in the final image—smile accepts perpetual outsiderhood as next gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara steps toward the spire having redefined forgiveness as polyphonic, the cost being the elders’ withheld absolution. Causal chain holds—each echo experiment tightens her resolve; elder confrontation forces the final stance. Orientation is clean by line 10. One tight lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and held. The “price” is conceptually reweighted on-page in the final echo.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: every beat is a therefore/because linkage—mentor’s death → Maya’s turn; charm fit → golden vein; map revealed → breath-by-breath campaign. Orientation anchored by line 4; the 30-second air debt is the tightening metronome that narrows options until the final surfacing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sea is not healed, but meaning is re-priced—scars become constellations—with the felt cost of perpetual dives and certain death still ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story teaches its pattern early—thirty-seven years of identical harbor mornings—then fractures it with the mirror and the left-turn into the cave. The closure is a Charged Poise: the shells, scattered and perishable, reprice “art” from permanence to momentary witness; the cost is the surrender of her quayside sanctuary and the embrace of ephemeral making. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors (harbor→signpost→crevice→cathedral) are crisp within 120 words. The final image of leaving the easel behind crystallizes the reconfiguration with undeniable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the heartbeat-light re-weights the safety protocol forever. Causal linkage holds: scent → captain leans in → course corrects; lighthouse pulse keeps the because/therefore chain. Cost is legible in Thomas’s weathered face shift. One scaffold loop—“the wind carried away the last traces… but its message lingered”—clips the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass reveals migration is a temporal gravity well, reweighting every prior beat. Causality holds—each midnight call escalates the build, the bronze’s shifting patina motivates the design change, and the finished device crystallizes her refusal. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts perpetual exile while the antenna stays dead—an Earned Stasis that forecloses reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s stance crystallizes in the final orchard image—she accepts her role as steward of a placebo ritual that nevertheless restores conversational grace. Cost is legible in her unpriced labor and the quiet surrender of her isolation, shown in the relinquished eye and unpaid invitations. Causal chain holds: found relic → rumor of “occlusion” → belief-enabled careful speech → micro-society re-knits; each because/therefore step is motivated and tight. Orientation is handled by ~120 words; no prop teleport or lens drift; structure is single-scene with one micro-turn, satisfying short-form scope.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Magnus’s pinning of the flower reweights “borrowed memories” from abstract theme to lived obligation, cost visible in the last line. Causal linkage holds: key arrives → coordinates discovered → dawn plan forged; no retro patches. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absence-teasing builds to cadence shift at nautical twilight; no contradiction. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (keeper duty) shapes tactics, and cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: translucent wall of possible selves crystallizes options, then brass letter removed—cost is the felt vertigo of choosing again. Causal chain holds: grandmother cue → chip → ants → map recess → vision; each step follows logically. Orientation: who/where/when anchored by line 4; no penalty. Drive lens = Causal; no ambiguity at end. One minor soft spot: the “promise” concept is named late, not quite set up as a tangible stake in first third, so cost is slightly abstract until final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (cobalt stone drinking twilight, starlight that burns cold, fireflies as reversed stars) intensifies the dominant stake—self-witness at any price—until the final breath reweights her identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “She took one breath. Then another. And began the long climb back…”—a crystallized moment where future cost is undeniable. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are vivid within 120 words. Persistent constraint (the wound of starlight) shapes the return journey. Tiny causal hiccup: the oracle’s lacy menace is declared but not enacted, yet this is thematic, not plot-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the last sphere crystallizes “testimony” rather than commodity light, with conceptual cost legible in Mira’s closed palm. Causal lens holds: because Solène etches the spiral formula → therefore she can birth witness-light → therefore she must leave the old order. Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens drift. Setup (Academy exile) pays off in the final refusal to power cities.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens declared early via “time was soup now” and held to the last line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scroll-boxing beat crystallizes her perpetual rewrite without curing displacement; cost is the knowledge that memory itself is just another story. Causality is lyric-patterned, not linear, but the tightening is the density of repeated scroll entries that foreclose the fantasy of coherent autobiography. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50 and never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elena reframes the stopped clock from failure to ritual pause, chaining the screw as a portable blessing. The crack-in-reservoir reveal acts as a conceptual repricing—leakage is not malfunction but necessary release—paid for by her forfeited repair fee. Causal lens holds: because she sees the flaw, she chooses non-repair, therefore gifting Mrs. Kapoor (and herself) permission to breathe. Cost is legible in the final pendular image of screw dangling against morning light.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s out-of-season bloom reweights “imperfect miracles” with visible ecological cost under an Accumulative lens. Pattern is taught early—music sheets as emotional barometer—and the final image of petals “like forgiveness” crystallizes the reconfiguration. Causality holds: because Margot deletes and rewrites, the archive quiets and the orchard answers. Time compression (single night) is coherent; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early—“seventeen dimensions,” “probability’s shadow”—and closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s laughter reweights all prior illusion talk. Orientation is taught, not anchored; causality is lyrical, not sequential, but the pattern holds. The cost is felt—“she was no longer entirely herself”—yet the紧缩 is diffuse because the tightening spirals are described, not decisionally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: three seconds deleted/created, horizon re-sewn, Maren’s blood the tariff. Causal chain (clock lag → key turn → horizon flex → silence) holds; the mantle clock’s thirty-year wind is the single tolerated impossibility taught early. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The missing −0.3 to reach 9.0: the deleted seconds’ social consequence is implied, not shown, so cost is felt but not yet persistent in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s release enacts the physics metaphor and reweights her future options with undeniable, quiet cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fungal glow and network talk adds density until the final cadence shift (“quiet wildfire of her understanding”) crystallizes the stance. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (warehouse, pre-dawn, observation deck) and no props teleport. The single soft spot: the ex-partner is never given even a shard of on-page memory, so the “before” is more inferred than felt; this nudges cost legibility down a hair but does not rupture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the negative-space letters re-weight her koan-reading, making “probability = possibility” a usable stance toward her father. Causal chain (symbols → lantern distortion → negative space → widened view) is tight and on-page. Library-to-hospital exit supplies visible pivot with felt social cost—she must face the man she almost wrote off. Meets 9+ cost test; lens is cleanly Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sarah’s re-pronounced “Wrong number” reweights the rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits cultivated estrangement itself. Causal chain holds: disc confession → caller return → protocol breach → invitation; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 86 (“Tunnel 47, six levels beneath…”); no penalty. Lens clarity maintained: Causal, confirmed by final rule inversion that shapes future calls.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Maren’s stained hands taken by Mrs. Corvin crystallize the covenant’s reversal with undeniable conceptual cost—“you made our leaving matter.” Accumulative lens holds: the lockets, scent, and ink accumulate until the final image reweights their meaning. Causality is retroactively coherent rather than一步步驱动, but the pattern is taught early (“she would archive this too”) and paid off. One soft spot: the mass return is off-stage triggered; luck complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under Accumulative rule.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the seventeen fragments reweighted as “permission to stop moving” crystallizes a new social contract under the ivy station roof; cost is felt in the forfeiture of perpetual vanishing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each arrival thickens pattern until the combined fragments reframe loneliness itself. Orientation is anchored by word 54 with “disused railway station…ivy,” satisfying the 120-word test. No causality breaks; the rumor chains are presented as mysterious but never resolve through luck—final stance is internally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each ultrasonic fragment layers until the sister’s melody reframes grief as home; closure is a Charged Poise—kneeling palms-down—where mapping loss becomes the new compass; cost is the lifelong labor of charting absence, felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of writing with the newly-inked pen reweights the premise—history is still being drafted and she now helps write it. Causal linkage holds: the pen’s straightening triggers her decision, and the gravitational bookmark anomaly is revealed as the revision nexus. Cost is legible—“stars blinked in patterns that wouldn’t exist for another century” shows perpetual epistemic loss. One small lens wobble: “contingent relationships” mechanics are stated late, but the pattern is taught early enough via altered star logs to waive a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty-camera click reweights silence into music, transmuting isolation into shared sound with undeniable conceptual cost—Marina abandons the film-based future. Causal linkage holds: Theo’s program is the because that lets Marina’s mapped silence therefore sing; her final click is the renunciation that forecloses nostalgic preservation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (silver harbor, moon, pier). No lens ambiguity; the ending crystallizes options under causal logic. Cost is visible: she trades film for real-time communion, accepting ephemerality.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared on page 1 (“analytically intuitive”) and held to the last photograph: each artifact-layer reweights the stake until the tapestry-match becomes a conceptual repricing of love itself. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara steps into sunlight carrying evidence that will convict or vindicate her—cost felt, path foreclosed. No causal gap survives; even the “lending-library arsonist” label is retroactively paid off as the institutions’ own interlibrary loans enabled her map. The story earns its final hush without explanatory exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: interlaced drumming crystallizes the merger option under starlit lagoon reflection, undeniable cost in “two minds learning to become one song.” Causal lens holds—each drum-tap visibly escalates entanglement, no coincidence. Orientation is taught by ~100 words; no debt. One micro-turn: resisting separation to embracing unity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: storm → wall-shift → auditory tactic → coin-as-key → door opens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (Port Cervantes, geomagnetic storm, maintenance map). Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus’s tapping his own walk-pattern into the keyhole crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures his identity from “worker” to “keeper” with visible cost—he forfeits the old orientation system. Persistent constraint: the whisper-method now governs his future navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is tight: discovery of canal-fill plan → silent mirror signaling → shutter-map that will expose the guild. The ending delivers Conceptual Repricing: dawn will make the city see, cost is Marina’s continued secrecy. Anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; orientation waived as disorientation is never invoked. One meaningful escalation beat—her realization that the guardian knows—narrows options and is legible under Causal lens. Closure cost is visible in the final line: she walks home still gagged by the half-spoken secret.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Miss Chen’s diagonal queen move re-weights the rules—chess becomes a model for distributed resistance—while the misted library window glows as an undeniable social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each micro-choice (sharing sketches, naming the grotto, refusing to beg Danny to stay) accretes until the final image reconfigures the town’s “predictable geometry.” The late reveal of synchronized window displays is earned because earlier beats taught the pattern of symbolic action over confrontation. No orientation debt; time/space anchors clear by line 40.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: scrimshaw find → shared longing → whale call → joint detachment. Closure is a Charged Poise on the dock: options rewritten, cost felt in the loosening “dock’s grip.” Orientation anchored by line 8; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn—Mira finishing Kael’s sentence—tightens intimacy without resetting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final silent carve reweights the premise—grief no longer illegal yet still unspoken—and the cost is the father’s surrender of his protective script. Causality holds: because he narrated survival, therefore he can stop only once the hush is mutually broken. One reflective block (≤20 %) is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the stance. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene, single-POV, causal lens holds: because the ban lifts, therefore Meris returns; because she touches the pillar, therefore certainty arrives; because she composes, boundaries dissolve. Closure is an Earned Stasis (renunciation of fixed meaning) with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: “paraphrase would kill it” leans toward thematic echo rather than causal turn, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the bent reed becomes proof that “being broken…is just another way of being beautiful,” re-weighting the story’s value system with undeniable social cost. Causality holds: because Maya’s color-blind sight lets her prize tarnish, therefore she can paint awakenings and therefore the courtyard revives. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One minor strain: the phoenix event is off-stage mythic catalyst rather than earned turn, but it is accepted as situational given the fable tone.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two strangers stand inside the synthetic belonging while the miner’s lamp glows above them, reconfiguring “pilgrimage” from place to shared frequency. Cost is visible—the lab’s cold LEDs are swapped for warm candle-like risk, and Maren cedes her private quest to communal use. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of recovered fragments → density → final harmonic wash that reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the idea of artificial-made-authentic. Closure is a Charged Poise—observatory door left open, crane with coordinates placed for the next drowning stranger; cost is the perpetual reopening of Mara’s wound. Pattern taught early: “genuinely artificial keepsakes” → final crane is itself an artificial star-map that becomes genuinely hopeful. One transition (cellar→dome) is legible; no causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: cryptocrash → scholar-turned-cartomancer → circuit-map client → measuring-tape reveal → dawn collaboration, each beat a because/therefore step that tightens options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the grandmother’s “Rosetta Stone” re-weights both academic and folkloric knowledge with social cost—their future work will swim against capital’s tide. The only causality nit is the off-stage grandmother; her motives are inferred, never dramatized, so the emotional cost is second-hand, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s realization that transcendence = loss arrives on-page and reweights every prior crystal, forcing her to teach the Council “why some wisdom is forbidden.” Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each crystal intensifies the emotional density until the final image of the unveiled face charges the pagoda with a new purpose. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within the single scene. The cost is felt in her simultaneous smile/tears—“atoms of nostalgia” made literal.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is present—footage comparison → insight → decision—but the decisive change is off-stage. Closure lands on a future intention (“tomorrow she would begin sharing”) rather than an irreversible act that forecloses the archive’s sanctioned path. The river stone’s final placement is symbolic, not causal, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. The lens holds, yet the ending’s charge is blunted because the archive’s retaliation or her personal loss is neither faced nor implied beyond the rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the new document title typed in the final paragraph irrevocably forecloses the old fraudulent path and incurs the social cost of academic exile; the lens is Causal—each beat narrows her options until only the honest qualitative paper remains. The “shedding” image taught early (skin in corner) cleanly pays off in the final sentence, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal lens holds: each memory layer (ivy, table, roses) tightens options because Mara can only act after the plants yield their testimony. Closure lands with visible cost—her blood on the hourglass—signaling a decisive shift from seeking closure to pursuing justice. The Orientation Test is waived: delayed anchoring (tower, meteor hush) is taught by line 5 and pays off when the hush enables telepathy. One causal seam: the revelation that Dr. Venn moved the body is delivered via table-memory, not through an on-page choice that forces Mara to confront him; still, the new knowledge forecloses her previous goal and reframes her scars as evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the rain-broken thunder become the “forgotten lyrics finding their tune,” undeniable auditory proof that unused love is now in motion, reweighting the premise with social/imaginative cost. Causal chain holds—because she reads the strip, therefore finds the archive, therefore chooses dispersal—under Causal lens. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the strips’ physicality and the map’s necessity shape every late tactic. Cost visible in the final auditory image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Create” reweights the premise, felt cost is the Keeper’s dissolution and Celestine’s prior calcification, causal lens (Accu/Lyric) holds cleanly; the single scene is anchored by 120 wds and the final aurora-to-dawn cadence tightens meaning without outside contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is Charged Poise: the seeds root across superposed futures while the chess clock ticks once—time persuaded, cost paid in her perpetual wakefulness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of luminous dune, humming seeds, and frozen midnight tightens meaning rather than plot causality. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One beat—seed scatter—reconfigures the world’s possibilities with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each gear and sonic cue thickens pattern until the forest-map projection reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—he sees the forest as his own neural map—so the cost is conceptual, felt in the “wild frontier” line. One soft spot: the mechanism suddenly projects a hologram that solves the puzzle; because the projector was never seeded, causality blinks for a beat (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the star-shaped aperture reframes the broken leash into a portal, re-weighting safety as cage; cost is the implicit forfeiture of her small life. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each punch-through adds density until the twilight image crystallizes choice; no causal reversals required, pattern taught early. Orientation is secured by word 40 (ferry guides, ridgeway, dusk). Persistent constraint: the guides’ decree “without a leash” forecloses any halfway return, shaping the final sprint.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: two survivors share a broken anthem whose meaning has been repriced—safety now equals perpetual shared debt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—snow, silence, nerve regrowth, and bolt-splinters accrue until the chord crystallizes them. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 2; no penalty. Cost is visible on-page: “each note a small resurrection” while snow keeps burying footprints—hope and erasure locked together.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the rune-fractured lies collapse gracefully across the realm, final image of drifting starlight-pages reweights the premise. Causal chain: pellet→quill→rune inserts→oneiric corrections; each because/therefore link visible. Orientation anchored by line 3(timeless library) and line 10(object arrival), beating the 120-word guide; no debt. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural—density of inserted truths tightens pattern once—then lands as CR with undeniable social cost. One hairline slip: “Tuesday that might have been a Thursday” is cutely meta but doesn’t threaten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ocean’s mnemonic testimony reweights human history with undeniable culpability; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (tapping, vanished routes, ghost currents) tightens until the Morse reveal reconfigures meaning; cost is conceptual but legible in the bleached-reef image; one minor scaffold: “She began to type her report” is pure utilitarian transition that slightly dulls the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the stone circle rewrites the rebellion’s premise, cost is the surrender of old tactics, felt in the subsonic hum. Causal chain: because the rebellion lulled → Kess searches → finds circle → circle re-educates her stance. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of decay→circle→reframe. One minor loop: “the way silence could roar… the way stillness could shake you” is near-paraphrase; does not touch closure, so −0.2 routed to Q7 only.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: kite script → decoding → cavern → embryo → spores → new symbiosis, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: her body becomes the bridge, foreclosing isolation. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The kite’s prior owner remains off-stage, a hairline gap that keeps the score sub-9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira returns to seedlings after releasing the photo, foreclosing the path of constant mourning. The cost is legible—she will “never stop missing them” yet chooses cultivation—crystallized in the night-blooming cereus anecdote that reweights grief into attentive waiting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: layers of daily ritual, seasonal bloom, photo handling accumulate to tighten meaning rather than causal plot turns. Orientation is clean (cliff arboretum, morning, lone gardener) by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral burn reweights reality’s structure with undeniable cost (“truths remained… on her retinas”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern break rather than causal chain—held cleanly to end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5, well within 120-word window; no penalty. One soft spot: the walls’ reversal feels like an external toggle rather than consequence of her agency, blurring the because/therefore linkage under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: each breadcrumb of ink tightens Kael’s options until the cave standoff. The closure is a Charged Poise—he radios “target acquired” but only after paying the price of watching the ephemeral map complete—so the rule-set is repriced: justice now includes the knowledge Vera gave him. No orientation debt; place-time-anchor arrives by line 3. Minor slack: the thesis line “Time fractures where attention crystallizes” is the only overt statement; if it had been buried in gesture this would hit 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Maren’s irreversible thaw order reconfigures both personal fate and global stakes. Causal chain holds: anonymous letter → vault override → recorded self-condemnation; each because/therefore link tightens options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“thirty meters of permafrost”) well within 120-word window. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence: “ending her own life as she’d known it.”

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ending beat—“Tea sounds good”—is a Charged Poise: the blade stays sheathed, the farm remains, and the father’s tactical life is foreclosed with a single phrase. Causal chain holds: ballast-scrap roses → Mira’s refusal → offer of cutting → Kael’s renunciation. No orientation debt; dome, quarter, season are anchored by word 50. The dust-thinning light is the conceptual re-pricing that makes the cost social, not only personal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lyrical-accumulative structure teaches its pattern early—silence as bait, garden as translator—and returns to re-weight it when the echo crystallizes inside Mara, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: she now carries an alien heartbeat. Causality is poetic, not mechanical, yet the sleepwalking constellations and zigzag flowers tighten the texture toward the capture beat. Closure obeys the lens: pattern intensifies until meaning, not plot, turns. The only slack is the off-stage grandmother voice doing causal lifting that could have been one on-page memory fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the editorial she writes crystallizes a new stance—“silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender”—with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds: because father retracted strategically, therefore Celeste now publishes, and the persistent constraint (family name, observatory isolation) shapes the final image. Cost is legible in the single sentence where dawn light meets clouds below, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: empty amber + resolved code melody reweight her prior algorithmic worldview with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout: because she chose data over nephew, firmware weeps; therefore she rewires her own pattern. Amber-as-bridge pays off the orientation image of crystalline sound storage. Cost is legible in the final hush: “amber, now clear and empty.”

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emergent hush reconfigures collective stakes without restoring memory, cost felt in the warm tile and the unspeaking circle. Causality holds—because she chalks, the hush coalesces—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean by line 4; the single transition (arrival → gathering) is legible. No late convenience breaks the lens; the persistent constraint of vanishing names tightens to the last breath.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the naming of the dead rewrites the plaza’s future, a Conceptual Repricing that costs her the safety of anonymity beneath a regime still hunting her. Causality holds—each tessera she places is a because/therefore step toward that final inscription—though the loop’s mechanics (how physically touching a chip unmakes the spell) is hand-waved rather than taught. Orientation is swift: plaza, post-fire, augmented soldier all anchor within the first 100 words. The tiny causality wobble keeps it just south of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-dense pirouette thickens the garden’s temporal weave until applause from three eras fuses into one resonant chord. Closure is Charged Poise: the shattering coin releases her into perpetual performance—cost is the irreversible surrender of linear self. Pattern taught early (fractured time, colored sound) pays off in final aurora-bow. No orientation debt; maze/orchard anchors planted by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mara’s choice to map pathways crystallizes a new vocation with felt cost—her lost boundaries. Causal lens holds: because the shock rewired her, therefore she can see, therefore she resolves to guide others. One soft spot: the shock→pill interaction is retro-explained rather than witnessed; a micro-drag but not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s sentience reweights Maren’s purpose, cost is felt in irrevocable fusion of self with alien memory. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer deepens emotional density until boundary dissolves. Orientation clear by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—she exits “porous”—shapes future hibernation cycles, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hourglasses physically slow, confirming that shared context reweights time itself. Causality is intact—Mara’s public staging of echo + charts triggers the collective response. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (buttons, echo) accretes until the cadence flips. Cost is felt on-page: “the warehouse would become just another tomb” is forestalled by her exposed act, and the new foot-traffic permanently alters the space’s social function.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus pockets the pillbox and walks downhill—an Earned Stasis that costs him the safety of isolation forever. Causal chain holds: pillbox → snow-map → Emma → documentation; each because/therefore linkage is legible on-page. Snow-melt clock (three days) tightens options, satisfying the 9+ persistent-constraint test. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 11; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mosaic two-shard structure (crossing + arrival) taught by 25 % pattern of fog-time units; one transition (gutters fall silent) cleanly marks closure beat. Orientation anchored by word 60 (coachman, river, fog, night). Closure = Charged Poise: “yarn needle still tucked…toward the lights” reweights concept of layered truth with felt cost—he relinquishes authority over meaning. Drive lens Accumulative/Textural; fog density and ticking gutters tighten until silence releases meaning; no causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each kindness image layers density until the final chord tightens meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of lantern glow reframing her craft; the conceptual cost (“carry it forward”) is legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; timeline shards are taught early through lantern-glass rule. One shard, zero causality breaks; no meaningful orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: mounting the gauge tooth beside the mirror crystallizes her inherited vocation—light not locks—and the cost is the bare rosebush she must keep tending. Causality is accumulative/textural: mirrored gardens tighten pattern until the neighbor’s seedlings prove the system’s reach. One transition (street→fire-escape loop) is legible; orientation anchors by line 5. No meaningful tightening mid-piece keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts her multiplicity and the library keeps writing her future—cost is the perpetual tension of never being “one thing.” Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each reflective block is anchored to tactile cues (sundial, stone hum) and alters her micro-choices (how she touches the wall, how she catalogs). Orientation is clean by word 75. No teleporting props; the blank book’s appearance is motivated by the tidal system introduced early. Cost is felt: she forfeits finality for endless translation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a textbook Charged Poise: Margot ties her letter to the spiral, reconfiguring her role from invisible scribe to visible participant under prismatic light. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (spiral of secrets) and deepens through each suspended object until the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable cost—she can no longer hide behind others’ words. Causality is intact: because she sees the spiral, therefore she surrenders anonymity. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored within 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: subsonic bait → trickster attention redirected → campus chaos recedes, all legible under a Causal lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the spiral withdrawal and warm laughter are the felt cost of Mara’s gamble, confirmed when colors fade and equipment stops self-repairing. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (overnight DJ, WKRU, present semester timeline) and stays coherent; no orientation debt. The only slack is the off-stage “emergency meeting” beat, summarized rather than scened, slightly blunting the tightening just before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because she studied the blueprint she finds the nexus; because she listens to the organ she locates the disc; each vibration rotates the map, tightening knowledge until freedom’s geometry is legible. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her “compass point felt warm” reweights the city’s rule-set, making conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within 60 words. No prop or knowledge teleportation; the disc’s second layer is foreshadowed by earlier hum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the ribbon in Elena’s hand reweights the premise—empathy itself becomes the recognized portrait. Causal chain holds: ribbon ➜ interviews ➜ ambiguous portrait ➜ witnesses ➜ Elena’s unknowing triumph. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“Elena stood at its edge”). One minor ellipsis—how exactly the portrait triggers three witnesses same day—is within motivated compression for 700-word scope. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught by recurring “furrowed hush” cadence; final silence crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the two women step toward the wound-door, options narrowed, cost felt in the station’s abandoned instruments. Causal chain holds: nail → journal decoding → site identification → air-lock decision, all “because/therefore” links. One soft spot: the station’s sub-ice access appears only in final paragraph—no prior cue—so the decisive locale feels lightly teleported rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes in the charged image of her aching arm and dissolved flake, cost visible and felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of noticing → recording → translating → releasing escalates density rather than causal twists, final cadence shift reweights “bridge-song” from human to metaphysical clientele. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Hitchhiker vanishing is allowed coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Minor slip: “pixelated amnesty” is named before shown, a thin set-up, but the flake’s later animation pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the father’s “Show me your markers tomorrow” crystallizes a new, fragile alliance; the cost is the irretrievable exposure of Marco’s sanctuary. Causality holds: each beat (hanging currency → sensor disguises → father’s arrival) is linked by because/therefore logic; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The single causal tightening—father asks to learn the markers—carries persistent constraint: once taught, the secret can’t be untaught.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-catalog fragments and dream-journal shards build density until a single cadence shift—"we could publish this together"—reweights the stake from solitary mastery to shared witness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the act of co-writing crystallizes options and forecloses Ashwin’s path with undeniable cost felt in the daylily’s presence. Orientation is clean by line 4; brass telescope and telegram anchor who/where/when. No meaningful escalation flaw; the deepening is the discovery that the code is designed for chorus, not solo.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Maren’s laconic last line reweights the whole search—truth is not missing, people are. Causal lattice holds: expanding-circle method taught early, seeds foreshadow forbidden motive, mirror-gaze triggers paralysis, war-song cracks it. Orientation anchored by line 4 (who, where, when). One hairline slip: “three days ago” is offstage exposition, but it motivates the search and never breaks the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is present: clipped topiary → scar-link → shared vision → new covenant, each link legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the covenant’s collapse is re-weighted by the fertile soil image—yet the cost is abstract (lost certainty) rather than felt on the body or in imminent risk. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. One soft reset: the “anxious elation” label is stated identically before and after the link, flattening the because/therefore rise.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands with unmistakable cost: the burned card left on the martyr’s palm crystallizes the irreversible taint of swapped souls. Causal chain holds: failed reversal → acceptance → joint walk-away. Accumulating pattern of barter, botched return, and residue burns the rule-set into the reader. One micro-turn—Rebecca wanting her melancholy back—tightens stakes exactly where needed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus abandons fact-armor for felt judgment, cost visible in “might sustain him through the silence ahead.” Causal linkage holds: Ming mis-ID → reputation collapse → bottle doubt → stance flip. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One reflective block (~18%) is tethered to present objects and alters immediate tactic, satisfying BRR. No lens ambiguity; situational pressure tightens to crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing reframes grief as a phase-shift, not erasure (“nothing was ever lost, only changed”). Causal chain: seed → field tremor → instant vine → fruit → knowledge → re-planned legacy; each step narrows her options from mourning to archival duty. Accumulating pattern of transformation (water, cuneiform, magnetics) teaches lens early; final image crystallizes new stance. Cost is the irreversible taste of lightning—her worldview permanently magnetized.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mobile of identity-fish reframes “who we are becoming” as an eternal present-school whose pattern, not future, supplies wonder. Accumulative lens holds: each reveal (shelves, scroll, fish) deepens thematic density rather than causally reversing stakes; the final moonlit school image reweights prior material with undeniable social cost—identity is now an aesthetic migration, not a telic journey. Orientation is anchored by line 15; no penalty. Persistent constraint (no tomorrow) shapes every tactic; cost is legible in the repurposed licenses reduced to ornamental fish.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus crowns himself with abandoned hopes, crystallizing a new mandate under undeniable cost. Causal chain is clean—shell confession → pearl glow → caves respond → Marcus chooses reparative mission—each step tightening options. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: light density increases until the final image reweights survival itself. Cost is palpable in the pearl’s warmth and the tremor in his hands; persistent constraint is the cave’s testament that preservation without circulation is death.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s last tile-question reframes self-forgiveness from destination to current, charging every prior river measurement with new cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of ivy, water, and graffiti layers tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 40 inside the station; no penalty. Persistent price visible: she exits without instrument or former safety, future wading now unbuffered.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: watch-cipher → shelf-mapping → grandmother’s confession → renounced revenge. Letters supply ticking clock; “document everything” rule pays off when her journal literally steers path-finding. One transition (enter→deep stacks) is clean; orientation clear by 80 words. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the library stays open, her hunt reframed, cost visible in the watch’s now-mere ticking.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the encrypted dispersion of truth reweights the stakes—Empire keeps artifact, monks keep knowledge—costing Elena her reputation. Causal chain holds: coffee prophecy → two futures → hybrid third path; lens (Hybrid) stays coherent. The violin’s scheduled melt is the persistent constraint that shapes the tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mirrors, chip, and aurora converge to reconfigure meaning—“endings could still hold light”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because Lyra guards the thermal threshold, therefore the body stays workable; because she positions the mirrors, therefore the aurora multiplies; because the emerald chip is placed, therefore the pulse syncs and the moment charges. Orientation is anchored by word 40. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of rising luminosity and stillness tightens once with visible stakes. No penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hairpin transfer reweights the entire quest, making “the seeking itself” the new, un-closeable source. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud-grotto visit layers density until the mother-face reveal breaks the pattern with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“summit of the oldest cedar”) and again at the descent, so no penalty applies. One scaffold loop—“like a secret held between sky and heaven… like a promise, like the next breath”—is decorative but does not touch the final beat, so only a −0.1 line-level nick is routed here.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: clipping the hollow shard reframes her vocation from answer-giver to doubt-holder. Cost is visible—the shard stays behind, rainbow fragments left on weathered wood—foreclosing the old business model. Causal chain holds: Vincent letter → doubt → beach shard → lighthouse → unhooking. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 8; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the teacher knowingly gifts knowledge she will lose, creating a forward/backward paradox with felt conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds—each prior image (stone, ripples, grotto) recurs in the final paragraph as charged echo—so Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a quiet Charged Poise: Kael turns toward the third tower, accepting “long work,” the cost reframed as patient centuries already waited. Causality holds—arrowhead → ravens → fracture diagnosis → commitment—each because/therefore legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered echoes gain density until the final stance crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 40. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last sentence; meets 9+ cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the limestone’s pulse synchronizes with her breath, reweighting failure as presence; the cost is the hours of cold, near-collapse stillness paid in-scene. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sputter of magic adds density until the spire’s “brilliant dimness” reconfigures meaning rather than grants power. Orientation (who/when/where) is anchored by line 6; no debt. All beats advance pattern, no soft resets; the final image crystallizes option—she stays to notice rather than to achieve.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early—lamps ascending like delayed stars, algae blooming in bottles—holds to closure where the same lanterns become musical notes. One seamless scene with two time-pressures: lantern release (external) and falling tide (internal); transitions are legible. Orientation anchors (who, when, where) arrive within 120 words without stall. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara sees the lanterns as color-notes, reconfiguring her nightly ritual into an unfinished symphony; cost is the solitary cold she carries back onto the pier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s contraction reframes the coins’ randomness into survival instruction, cost legible in the white-out final image. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens tightens through density of static bursts and coin patterns; each new burst re-weights the stake. Orientation is clean: crystalline dome, brass bowl, collapsing cosmos anchor who/where/when inside 50 words. One scaffold loop—“wavelength aligning with purpose” repeated near end—slips cadence but does not touch the final image, so penalty stays minor.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira steps into darkness carrying the sea-monster atlas, the named dread now a portable burden we feel she will forever pay for. Causal lens holds: every reflection loops back to a concrete present stimulus (torn page, brass tubes, telescope light) and culminates in the micro-choice to walk away. One scaffold echo—“She understood that impulse now”/“She had given her fear a name”—is unnecessary paraphrase, but it does not touch the final image. Cost is unmistakable: the atlas pressed “next to her heart” reconfigures love into duty with visible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every bell-strike and drip reversal is a because/therefore consequence of Emris’s reconstructed clapper. Closure lands with unmistakable cost—his magic “exhausted” and body shadowed across the viaduct—reconfiguring the world’s debt. No teleporting props; the bell’s barnacle-letters pay off in the dawn legibility beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus will resume his watch, but now carries the town’s stories as an additional weight, foreclosing the path of pure forgetting.  The photograph trail is causal engine and teaching device; each image tightens the lure toward memory.  Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of images and receding water reweights the stake from safety to stewardship.  Cost is felt in the final chimed dawn: he must return to the ridge to guard what he now cannot un-remember.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of images (starlings, orchard, crystal) accrues meaning until the cadence shift of the glowing vial reweights the stakes. Orientation is secured inside 40 words; the waterfall’s “impossible geometries” teach the reader to accept non-standard physics early. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing vial is a crystallized final image that makes the conceptual cost—she can never again pretend science and intuition are separable—undeniable. One minor scaffold: “for three years she had pursued” is pure exposition that could have been shown via a micro-choice here.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she refuses to rescind her notation, Command ultimately accepts it—the tightening occurs through her sustained resistance. Orientation anchored by 120 words (who: Pattern Seeker; where: aerial arbor platform; when: 2:47 AM). Closure is Earned Stasis—she keeps her notation, loses external validation, cost legible in the solitary pen-resumption image. No causality breaks; pressure rises through each radio exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the clasped hands over the jar reconfigure custody into co-stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: numbness → need for counterweight → joint claim. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“floating rock dojo”), history-rewrite rule taught early, lens = Hybrid tilting Situational. Minor waiver: the jar’s prior off-stage duplication could feel convenient, but the label retroactively legitimizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: seed arrives ⇒ recognition ⇒ sabotage deduced ⇒ refusal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are locked by line 4. Closure lands with Decisive Change and felt cost—she forfeits certainty and embraces outreach—under a clean Causal lens. One hairline slip: “the mystery seed mail phenomenon had plagued…” is a touch of explanatory backstory before we see the envelope in her hand; it slightly softens the immediate present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gust thickens the acoustic grief-texture until the joined song reweights silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—no option is foreclosed, but the tunnel’s echo reframes their household quiet with felt cost (“laughter remembers its way home”). The hourglass line is a late abstraction that conceptually reprices time, yet causality between leaf-blower gas exhaustion and emotional permission is thin; the engine dies, therefore they sing floats too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: pendant thief → dream hunt → absorption risk → destroying key in dream to avert waking raid. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: by crushing rust, she accepts permanent daylight captivity in exchange for library safety—cost is the loss of dream-self, shown in the exhale of “ashes.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mist/frost/statues intensifies until interiorized, then shatters. One micro-turn at chain-snap is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the crozier’s rebirth re-weights Cassia’s entire past from failure to preparation. Causal lens holds—each failed experiment is revealed as cumulative ingredient. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“ember nexus smoldered at twilight”) and never slips. The only hairline flaw: the Church deacon’s voice is off-stage exposition, not dramatized pressure, so the external stake feels slightly abstract until the crozier itself begins to grow.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gorge flips from grave to canvas, crystal whispers “silence = origin canvas,” cost legible in her altered listening stance; causal chain holds—mentor clue → assumption discard → crystal retrieval → re-tuned array—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens imagery rather than plot reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ferry now sails a fused timeline, the hourglass flows sideways—cost is felt in the permanent loss of the old paradoxical state. Causal chain is clean: empty hourglass → phasing → grotto map → confluence merge. Orientation is nailed by word 70; lens holds as Causal throughout. Slight slack: the retroactive rule that the hourglass ever measured “tension between what was and what might be” arrives late and untelegraphed, softening the final reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final image of the glowing pattern re-weights the premise with conceptual cost—“love requires constant reconstruction”—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the single scene stays anchored, causality is illusion-logic but internally consistent, and the only slack is a slightly telegraphic final paragraph that could compress one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moment Carta’s finger traces star-paths through crushing water re-weights “navigation” itself, with the warm chain link tangible cost of forever altered perception. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of remembered starlight builds density until the final cadence shift; no causal reversals required. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“descended through the pressure locks”), well inside the 120-word window. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pattern or stakes. Only micro-slip: “three months had passed” is off-stage ellipsis, but it is paid off by her surrendered post and altered eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: Lily crosses the threshold, Mira’s assurance reframes the stake from eerie signal to lived rescue, and the grandmother’s pulse achieves its goal—earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality holds: hearing-aid pulse → Mira maps pattern → Lily appears, each step because/therefore. Cost is conceptual but felt: “You’re being protected. Even from beyond.” No orientation debt; twilight/ferns/headphones anchor by line 3. One minor loop: “refusing to let a signal fade into silence” repeats the prior paragraph’s gist.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s camera clicks codify Kove’s erased legacy, and the rising tide re-weights the facility as both tomb and monument; cost is felt in the flooding corridors she must abandon. Causal linkage holds—tide retreat triggers sensor spike triggers camera—so lens is Causal. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 20; no misplacement. One loop artifact (“crashing hush” repeated) nicks the top band but does not obscure cause or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s reinterpretation of Chen’s sacrifice reweights her guilt into assisted courage, with felt cost—tears freeze, fingers cease counting. Causal chain holds: ink pattern → software trick → file recovery → revelation. Orientation anchors within 120 words; snow-muffled observatory is clear. No lens ambiguity; pattern recognition motif is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon’s new permanent song is the Conceptual Repricing of her dead language. Causal chain—touch → diamond refraction → echo harmonics → bird pattern → perpetual acoustic texture—holds without gaps. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and are reinforced by tactile cues. Cost is visible in her “fingers worn smooth” and “copper veins dimmed,” satisfying the 9+ cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: static voices, moss-grown artifacts, and bioluminescent plants thicken until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maya’s pocketing the arrowhead and asking “when they return the second time” crystallizes her new stance with undeniable cost—she forfeits her report and former self. The underground garden and phone confessions are concrete anchors by word 80; no orientation debt. Causality is intact: each artifact (arrowhead, phone laugh) is discovered, not conjured, and the final question grows directly from them.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s mechanical certainties are re-weighted when golden tears feed new shoots. Causal chain (shell→resonance→statues crack→roots drink) holds. Orientation is swift; only mild ellipsis between orchard theft and twilight song, but pattern teaches itself. Cost is felt in the splintered violin and the open-ended “continuous becoming,” keeping lens stable.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: null-field → invisible drop → drone bypass → hand-off; each beat tightens the same stake. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—storm bottle/lightning as bottled people—whose social cost is legible without exposition. The lone price is oblique (Maren’s own containment), but the lens stays causal throughout and the final image reweights prior absences.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each salvaged piece adds density until the halo fragment completes the crown and the new music layers onto wind-bell chimes. Causality is soft—discovery by “wrong turn” is coincidence—but the final rotation is irreversible, reconfiguring silence into visible motion. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and hold; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpture spins, foreclosing endless repair yet confirming the carpenter’s vocation; cost is the never-finished labor embodied in his glowing hands.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each catalogued patron, book-form, and architectural quirk thickens the same question—where do stories live—until the scarf’s heat and the bending lamplight deliver a Charged Poise. Closure is legible: the library “breathes,” time re-geometries, a conceptual cost is felt. Orientation is clean by line 10; no prop teleport. The “reawaken” act is slightly abstract—no visible mechanics—but the image pool of bent lamplight satisfies the on-page reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural pattern is taught early (photograph overlays → light-letters) and lands a resonant reconfiguration: Mara steps into the beam, becoming archive. Causality is lyric rather than tight—each sunrise adds density, not immediate threat—but the closing “charge” reweights all prior images; cost is legible in her forfeiture of corporeal keeper role.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “a new locksmith was born” reweights the city-as-mind premise with visible ontic cost. Causal chain is clean—ribbon → coordinates → descent → book → transformation—yet the locksmith’s earlier powers (materialising without footfalls, speaking in thesis) are never causally tied to Mara’s agency, so some beats feel situational rather than consequential. Orientation is late (who/where locked at ~140 words) but the disorientation is thematic currency and pays off at closure, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. One micro-turn (streets rotate) tightens options legitimately; no off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each added layer (broken glass, constellation echo, shipwreck circle) reweights the same stake—how to keep memory alive. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the moment she bags the mushrooms, memory stops being hoarded archive and becomes live digestion. Cost is legible: “Not preserved. Living.” anchors the before/after shift. Orientation taught early (“purple dusk,” headlamp beam) waives any anchor penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pair’s shared reflection in the trapped shadow crystallizes “reversible exile” with felt cost—the librarian admits she still walks backwards. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each mention of the glass shard and tea-leaf geometry accretes meaning rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored within 60 words. The ending image reweights the premise without explanatory moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the glowing seed planted in view of the roaring falls reconfigures the world’s imaginative economy and carries visible cost—Mara’s exhaustion and surrendered blood. Causal lens holds throughout—“because” she bleeds, the veil thins; “therefore” wonder flows into seed; planting it forecloses her chance to ever harvest for herself. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words and never drifts. The final image crystallizes both consequence and future stakes without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene causality holds: each loosened knot releases a name and eases the ghost, building a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the net dissolves, the fisherman solidifies, silence lifts—cost is felt in the dissolving net and the dawn-lit names. Orientation is swift: midnight arrival and altar net anchor who/where within fifty words. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early and paid off in refracted starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vault’s question-mark cracks re-weight silence from threat to invitation, and Maren’s decision to walk onto the moor carries undeniable conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds across dual footage, rain, fresco—until the final image tears the map open. Causality is clean: rotated stone → points to gap → vault asks → Maren answers. Only nit: the “methodically curious” tag is told, not proved in scene, a micro-gate squeak but not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each underwater detail layers density until the stake—mastery versus mystery—reweights. Orientation is fixed by word 30; the single shard (library → radio room) is cleanly bridged by motion through stacks. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena sets the globe back, crystallizing her refusal to keep solving, and the cost is palpable (“Some small planes should remain forever in flight”). No prop or fact appears without later echo (globe, journal, notebook form a triad of “last transmissions”). The decision forecloses her prior career logic without softening the unknown; the lens holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each graffiti stroke layers emotional density until the mural becomes a Resonant Reconfiguration—ghost’s gratitude pulses city-wide, Moth exits humming a new ballad, cost = endless itinerancy. Orientation anchored by word 40; no prop teleport. Single tightening beat: mural completion narrows her path from listener to lifelong transmitter. Closure image of “thank you in electricity” makes conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she finds goggles → reads fragments → therefore re-orients life at top floor. One continuous scene, 720 words; orientation anchored by line 4. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s refusal of promotion crystallizes new stance with felt social cost—she forfeits security. Persistent constraint: captain’s absence leaves her to act alone, price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drifting isolation deepens pattern rather than causal chain. The broken tether is the single external turn; all else is density accretion toward the final CR that “absence is a kind of presence.” Orientation clean by line 5; no ambiguity at closure. Cost is conceptual—her data will be laughed at—yet undeniable in the last line’s “watching back.”

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final brush-stroke of starlight reframes the entire enterprise—precision without recognition is its own form of sight. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern and texture accrete until the肖像’s empty perfection becomes unbearable. The single-scene orientation is anchored by ~100 words inside the hollowed oak; no penalty applies. Causality is internal but coherent: each tactile pass over the coin deepens the stakes of “getting it right,” culminating in the quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: starlings, chalk, phrasebook, and light density into a final crystallized stance rather than causal chain. Orientation complete before 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Closure is Charged Poise: the last image of re-forming starlings reconfigures the stake—she will mimic their dissolve-reform tactic. Persistent constraint (Guild secrecy) shapes her future tactics and is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of waves “meshing with the sky” re-weights the premise that imperfection can be beautiful function. The causal lens holds—each gear replacement tightens lunar time—and the cost is legible in the syncopated tick she walks away with. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are crystalline by line 6; no debt applied. One minor soft spot: the missing third gear is narrated as “consumed by whatever force,” a faint explanatory hand-wave that slightly dilutes the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each dawn chalk-message tightens the settlers’ interdependence, pattern visible by midpoint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s fading into light crystallizes her exclusion from the very community she restored; cost is the visible erasure of her hand. Persistent constraint (she can only manifest enough to grip brass) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sweep of the lighthouse beam reweights the prior nested patterns into a single Charged Poise—dawn is not guaranteed, yet the song persists. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each poetic recurrence (waves, dominoes of light, puppet smile) thickens the atmospheric stake rather than forward plot, and the final image crystallizes the cost of perpetual guardianship. The 3-minute Clock shift is off-stage cause; the story’s “event” is her bearing of responsibility, which is legible and felt. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: spatial orientation (“gnarled tree… cliffside labyrinth”) is anchored within 40 words; causality is pattern-assembly rather than event-chain. Closure is a Charged Poise—the nut held to stars—reweighting inheritance from curse to gift; the price (perpetual service) is felt without exposition. One transition (sunset-to-frost) is clean; no retroactive knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is clean and legible: Decisive Change via the five-fold dispersal + humming reprise produces a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief becomes “something she could live within.” Causal chain holds: foam observation → insight → ritual invention. However, orientation waiver applies: ravine geography (“braided” / “five channels”) is not anchored until ~160 words, and the disorientation is never leveraged at closure, so −0.4 is locked. Cost is felt but not persistent; no constraint carries beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transfer of bottle-darkness reconfigures the premise that erasure is a purchasable commodity, and the library’s rebalancing signals cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, transitions are smooth, and causal logic holds—only the parolee’s off-stage drink defers the decisive beat, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is coherent: dream → salt pools → descent → tactile healing → fortress dries. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the coral breathes, remorse is bearable, and Maron’s tear reweights the gift. Cost is felt—“only tears—his own”—yet the constraint (he will carry contagion risk forever) is only implied, not explicit, blocking 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the valley’s new symphony is irreversible, the absent cuckoo weight a felt price. Causality holds—because she grafts the weight to the fan, therefore the silos harmonize—yet the prior absence of any obstacle (no one tries to stop her) keeps the turn from tightening further. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“The astronomical clock tower had stood…”) and the lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through grain pitches until cadence shift reweights stakes. The cost is legible in the final line—“already planning tomorrow’s composition”—a future debt she’ll pay when the society notices the theft.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—layered dreams sedimented in stone and glass—and holds it to the resonant closure image of moonlight refracted into “pathways back to abandoned purpose.” The mirror’s final adjustment acts as Conceptual Repricing: the spectrum of silver threads visibly reweights the stakes, proving “nothing was ever truly lost,” with the cost felt in the canyon’s held breath and Elena’s transformed epistemology. Causality remains coherent within its lyric rules; no prop or memory teleports, and the 1962 periscope fragment’s history is cleanly tethered to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    The doodle→grotte→stone causal chain is tight: each step is motivated by manuscript direction and pays off in gravity-reversed discovery. Orientation is swift—who, where, when locked by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gravity’s snap-back burns the combinations into her memory, an irreversible cognitive implant that reweights her future. Cost is unmistakable in the final line—“she would tend it carefully, clandestinely”—a charged poise that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each porcelain fracture accumulates sonic possibility until dawn birds arrive as living crescendo; closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—music re-enters the world—yet causality is impressionistic (no setback or trade-off) so cost feels conceptual rather than personal, keeping it shy of 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is reframed as “incomplete,” not invalid, a decisive cognitive shift that reweights the political-spiritual rule-set with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds: because Kavir translates silence, the daughter can inherit a path that renounces renewal. Cost is felt in the final image—“rolling his stone through the last moments of twilight” marks endurance of ongoing exile. Persistent constraint: his exile remains, the stone’s dent still there, shaping the final solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp clicks open yet Marlow shuts the diary—an Earned Stasis that reweights empathy from extraction to accompaniment. Causal linkage holds: each frequency layer is a because/therefore step toward the audible click; the refusal to read now carries conceptual cost. Lens (Causal) is stable; no orientation debt. Final line recharges the opening silence trope with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystalline sphere reweights the premise—resilience is multi-temporal grafting—and the broken arrow’s silence shows cost (its echo complete). Causal chain holds: arrow warmth → water cue → convergence → sphere, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is clean by line 9; world rules are learned through action, not dump. The −0.1 gap: the sphere is found, not seized through a risky trade-off; a hair more agency would hit 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: container spiral → narcotic cloud → silent town → global warning. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; space and stakes stay legible. The midpoint tightening—Chen’s manifest reveal—narrows the threat from anomaly to systemic convergence, foreclosing the option to treat this as a one-off accident. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: Mara transmits data, cranes dismantle the labyrinth, wind runs clean; the cost is the indefinite, unending survey she now carries—felt but not yet paid—satisfying the CR bar.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sculpted hush unfetters, proving beauty’s utility via measurable frequencies the Council must accept; the cost is the loss of Mira’s illusion that bells manufacture wonder. Causal chain holds: Council threat → descent → aurora moment → cavern response → data recording → vote reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“entrance… beneath the glacier”). One minor scaffold: “the exact instant…” sentence is pure setup, not dramatized, but it pays off in the cavern’s synchronous reveal, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the fold opens, Maren steps through, thunder returns—Decisive Change with conceptual cost (world-loss). Causal chain holds: because guardianship failed here, therefore passage becomes possible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “avalanchingly quiet” and flute-as-silence, then reweighted when silence breaks. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by word 80. One scaffold loop—“the first note… the second note…”—dulls cadence but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each pressed sheet thickens the emotional palimpsest until the final glowing impression reweights the universe’s collapse into a Charged Poise. The vanishing stars act as persistent constraint, felt cost in the wink-out timed against her equation. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—she keeps working while the sky dies.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the pendant’s hum functions as a pattern that accumulates encounters and reweights Kael’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pendant is returned to him with a new mandate, the seed in pocket crystallizes the cost, and the final “already calling” re-energizes the motif. Causality remains coherent under accumulation; no teleporting props or retro-patches. The only minor drag is a slight Orientation lag at the merchant beat—who/where re-anchor is delayed to ~140 words, but the aurora and ridgeway are already cinematic, so the penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single-scene, causal chain: frost pattern → confrontation → joint purpose. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words; prism and quartz arbor act as recurrent constraints that pay off in the final image. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Hartley’s “I believed the moment I saw my wife’s face” severs his skeptic identity and commits both to professional risk. Lens holds; no causality or prop jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she crosses the jigsaw frame, trading places with Kenji. Cost is visible—“the raveling silence welcomed her home.” Causal lens holds: loom pattern → jigsaw frame → crossing. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) nailed by line 3. One soft spot: “time moved differently there” is told, not demonstrated, just before the final beat, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (sap veins → silk memory → conduit forge) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options toward the final insertion of crystal roots. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spent silk and lifting branch reweight the premise—resilience over exodus—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by line 5; no prop teleporting; magician arrival is motivated by the silk set-up. The price (exhaustion, spent memory, solitary future) is legible in the last two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through iterative sensory returns (17-min cycle, taste-shifts) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the final sentence “The space between worlds tasted like goodbye”—a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior fold. The cost is unmistakable: Kael forecloses reunion to preserve infinite Mira-variations. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the act of writing and inserting the glass visibly reconfigures Vera’s identity and perpetuates the chain with tangible cost—she finally exposes her own loneliness. The causal lens holds: lamp failure → urgency → Marcus’s plea → Vera’s decision to write, each step tightening options. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The only hairline slip is the late reveal of “Reticent Skipper” as signature; the story never shows her earlier drafts or hesitation to sign, so the moment feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward-illuminating green beam crystallizes Kael's stance with conceptual cost—he must keep laughing to save a world that ignores him. Pattern is taught early by "ancient shadows," paid off when dawn rises green, satisfying Accumulatory/Textural lens. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; temporal uncertainty is motif, not confusion. Micro-drag occurs because the causal trigger for tonight's storm (why 11:14? why now?) is asserted not narrowed, keeping the tightening just short of 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to apprentice reconfigures her future with visible cost—she forfeits ordinary life below and accepts the perpetual burden of others’ secrets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of refracted light/sun-trails tightens until the final image of wings trembling with “shared understanding” reweights stakes. Causality is clean; no orientation debt; set-ups (heartbeat, morpho wings, sun-trails) all pay off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens: pattern of dream-extractions tightens tone and stakes without causal reversals; each amber bead is a visible unit of reweighting. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—fountain dissolves transformed grief into water that will “nourish new seedlings,” making future loss inherit prior healing; cost is the irreversibility of that transfer. Orientation is crisp within 120 words; no props teleport. One soft spot: no persistent constraint carried forward—Mara’s tools are intact, her body unscathed, so felt cost is existential rather than tactical, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the woven dawns ignite a shared awakening with conceptual cost—“the realm she had labored to rekindle stirred at last.” Orientation anchors within 120 words; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of luminous fruit + song → density shift → reweighting. Escalation is present but gentle; no live option is foreclosed for Elora, so the tightening feels observational rather than decisive. Causality holds, yet the beat remains a one-way triumph; the absence of a reversible stake or persistent price caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the paradox rule-set is re-weighted when Iris realizes “staying while leaving wasn’t the mistake; thinking they were the same was.” Cost is legible—she forecloses the safety of perpetual withdrawal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored paradoxes (library geometry, invitation arrival, emotional contradiction) tightens once at midnight, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clean: address, time, and impossible geometry are anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece layers vanishings and guerrilla gardens until the final image reweights the premise: remembering can be an act of planting. Closure is a Charged Poise—seeds in pocket, city still forgetting—whose conceptual cost (she must now risk failure in public acts) is undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, permissible under the chosen lens; each new garden is a because/therefore response to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: crystal-hush setting + successive slide measurements tighten the dominant stake—“can any promise survive oblivion?”—until the undiminished 528 Hz pattern breaks the fade-only rule. Closure earns Conceptual Repricing: Maren re-categorizes her life’s work as vigil for the rare irrepressible vow, a stance shift with felt professional/existential cost. Causality remains internal but coherent; no orientation or prop issues. Lacks one external obstacle or ticking clock to push tension past 9.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: “because father recorded, therefore Nelle can threaten”; each beat advances knowledge or risk. Orientation arrives before line 40 with the pier’s lantern light and Crenshaw’s shadow, then stays locked beneath the rotting planks. The climax is a decisive change—Crenshaw’s routes stay quiet, Nelle keeps the recordings—priced by her permanent exile from community and father’s name; the final image of water lapping “as she climbed toward morning” makes the cost atmospheric and irreversible. No causality breaks; even the off-stage convenience of “three copies with runners” is seeded by father’s paranoia.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass needle settles on Kael, re-weighting the siblings’ self-understanding under aurora light with conceptual cost—weather-carriers as planetary messengers. Causal chain is thin: Mira’s experiment (showing the compass) instantly converts Kael’s lifetime shame to acceptance; no intermediate tension or failure beat tests the premise. Orientation is clear by 120 words—bluff, lavender, aurora, tin ring—so no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical repetitions of taste-scents and aurora pulses tighten the texture until the final image crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave becomes a living gallery, the broken lock in pocket signals foregone secrecy, and Elena’s bleeding fingers make the cost visible. Causal chain holds—dream summons → finds mother’s hidden true portrait → draws over stone → emerges transformed. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One micro-softness: the “hours passed” ellipsis could have carried a beat of fatigue to sharpen cost, but it doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mira accepts lifelong exposure to surface lies in order to ferry authentic words upward—"Show me how to deliver what was meant to be heard" forecloses retreat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (bodily wilt, map piece, Archive vessel) layers density until the final image reweights the premise. No causal gaps; postal fragment setup pays off in the grandmother reveal; orientation anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint—her physiological lie-detector—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bells’ flawed harmony reweights the world’s post-linguistic stakes, and the melting ice’s disappearance is the felt price. Causal chain (ice → water → altered timbre → pilgrim recognition → Mira’s new purpose) holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the first “unbearably human” tone forces her to abandon purity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: burying the photograph inside the “red as blood” rose crystallizes the new stance—tending rather than erasing. Causal chain holds: miniaturize → fail → bury → harmony; the persistent constraint (daily magnetic shift) shapes the final image and keeps the lens accumulative/textural without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: locket → key → mailbox → evidence → communal resolve. Orientation is swift and spatial logic holds as they move courtyard→mailroom. Closure lands with Earned Stasis: they foreclose eviction panic by choosing collective voice; the cost is the long legal fight ahead, felt in Jorge’s “We’ll need a lawyer” and Marissa’s tighter grip on the locket. One minor scaffold: “She’d learned that…listening heals” tells us the premise we already see.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tight causal spine: because the lab was flooded → grandfather’s gear survived → Elara can decode → she can code the dance → tomorrow seventeen walk free. Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the poem-garden that is also a jailbreak map reweights all prior “memoir” entries into weapons; cost is the perpetual endangerment of her own grief text. Lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The whale-as-archive premise is taught by the third paragraph; orientation anchors (who=Maris, where=docks, when=three days post-beaching) arrive inside 120 words. Causal linkage holds: because the whale carried absences, gravity warps; because Maris scatters flowers, she locates the heart; because she enters it, gravity stabilizes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the city above regains physics while Maris pays with erasure—felt cost legible in “the lanterns burned steady through the night” without her.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the wing’s dissolution reweights the entire valley’s reality, burying the name again under mapped silence. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each fold, whisper, and mapped pause adds density until the final cadence shift releases the hush across the land. Cost is unmistakable: “no one would thank her” and the candle already lit for the next wing. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: because Elena lies about needing Latin lessons, Mrs. Kovac tests her with the cornerstone photo; therefore the hidden architectural language is confessed and the seal passed on. Orientation is clean within 120 words (fire escape, meteor shower, Thursday tea). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the city spoke in stone” reweights every prior inscription as living dialogue; cost is legible—Elena can no longer pretend her ability is academic translation. Mrs. Kovac’s line “the buildings are interrogating you” crystallizes the new rule-set. Persistent constraint is visible: she now carries the seal and the duty to answer the city’s questions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s dawn refusal forever forecloses legitimacy, the shell bisection re-enshrined as irreversible cost. Causal chain holds: resonance poisoning → quarantine habit → garden → invitation → refusal. The “velvet garden at twilight” orients within 30 words; no orientation debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each flower adds density until the final cadence reweights solitude as victory. Cost is unmistakable—“ Recognition. Legitimacy.” rejected in the same breath that names them.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jade key is revealed not as a physical opener but as permission itself, reweighting every prior forgery. The causal lens holds—each forgery exists because the Magistrate silently enabled it—and the final image of Mei adding the key to her “tools” crystallizes the new rule-set with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rule-set “echoes require a listener” reweights the nexus’s memory-logic, and the cost is felt when Mara’s hoarse voice forecloses lifelong solitude. Lens holds Accumulative: each spiral disclosure thickens stakes until the starlit chamber crystallizes a new social contract. No orientation debt; geography and causality remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ruined snow globe becomes proof that love survives drowning, reweighting Maya’s lonely vocation. Causal linkage holds—each dream transcript, each candle, therefore narrows to this dawn drive to Halifax. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no prop or motive teleporting. Cost sentence: “some things survive even drowning” makes the price felt.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moon-path spirals, firefly geometries, and net-knots accrue until the bamboo whisk reweights “hidden effort” as sacred. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Closure = Charged Poise: Kenji returns the half-mended net, foreclosing his usual fix-everything path; apprentice’s new intentionality is the visible cost. Whistle and moon-path motifs tighten the final cadence, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the stillpoint science rewrites orchard “miracle” into accident, and Vera’s choice to obscure exact coordinates imposes social/ethical cost on herself, all legible on-page. Causal chain holds—shredded paper → coordinates → dig → decision—without logistical cheat. Drive lens is clearly causal; pattern is taught early and never breaks. Only hairline slip: the off-stage “someone” who first dug and shredded is never settled, a micro-motivation gap that nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-light and fragments intensify mood until she accepts the prophet’s invitation, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she is now conspirator in a dawn shaped from darkness. Slight causality wobble: the prophet’s direct address feels unheralded, a late external push rather than an inevitable outgrowth of her listening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each jarred sound thickens the pattern until the lullaby break reweights meaning. Orientation locked by line 4. Closure is Charged Poise: Cosima hands over the music box—conceptual cost is the surrender of her private archive, felt in the “heart jingling” line. Persistent constraint: poverty that forces barter of poems for lessons; price shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: key discovery → frequency recognition → intruder threat → re-tuning → self-sacrifice; each beat narrows exit ramps. Closure is the decisive reconfiguration: her heartbeat becomes the new cipher, a living DRM key. Cost is legible in the final line—“the lighthouse sang on” at the price of her ongoing bodily subscription. Persistent constraint established: the frequency can now only be replicated if someone duplicates her living heart.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ren’s dawn touch of basalt crystallizes the cost—she has re-channeled lineage into lunar verticality, forfeiting horizontal speed. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s datum accretes until the pattern itself becomes the decisive act. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Ren had arrived three days after…”). No meaningful escalation under this lens is required; the single deepening suffices. Cost is felt in the frozen lake’s “sharp reports” and her numb fingers, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal chain is tight: lantern → hidden chamber → Malcolm’s notes → Elena’s decision to expose Reeves. The Orientation Test is met within 120 words (who/where/when anchored in tunnel flood). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lanterns’ historical “safe passage” flips to modern whistle-blowing, with visible cost—Elena’s career is now forfeit, signaled by her upload to journalists. One minor scuff: the drought-to-flood timeline is told twice in adjacent sentences, a small loop that dulls the propulsion just before the squeeze-through beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: letter reveals prior misjudgment → acceptance of restoration → donation to prison program; each beat tightens options and makes the apology material. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the heart will beat again as social witness, a cost felt in irrevocable time and public exposure. Orientation is nailed by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold trace: “she already understood” is轻微的提前总结 but does not break immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the bell tower made of light and longing re-weights the premise, and the cost is felt—Mal sails toward an impossible future, leaving safe mooring. Causal links hold: kaleidoscope upgrade → coherent coordinates → final image; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored inside 120 w (“The workshop bobbed…acid sea”). One minor lens wobble: the bell’s responsive frequency is declared rather than demonstrated, but the final image redeems the abstraction, so the Lens ambiguity cap is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patch’s materialization and her decision to “archive herself” reweight the rule-set with unmistakable cost. Accumulative lens holds: 1408 pattern, patch reprise, and song motif tighten into the final image. Orientation clean by line 5; causality intact—each discovery (patch → voice files → self-upload) is a because/therefore step. Minor waiver: the 18-layer encryption yields without resistance, a contrived beat that slightly erodes earned entry.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors progressively refract emotional history until a pattern break reweights Maren’s tactics. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she renounces predictive certainty and embraces the fragile mirror-space of shared choice; the cost is the irreversible star-shot texture of the shadows she now carries. The lighthouse apples reflecting “two families remembering how to choose” crystallizes the new rule-set without moralizing. No causal gaps; orientation is anchored by word 70; escalation is the tightening density of glimpsed hinge-moments that force her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early and held: the hum of endings layers with each village visited until the final re-pricing—“the approach itself was part of the song.” The closure is a Charged Poise: Vera’s postponement of Thursday’s appointment crystallizes her new stance while the parasol’s further wear shows time paid. Cost is legible in the single line “the parasol’s tip wore smoother in her grip.” No orientation debt; place, time, and agency anchor within 120 words. One micro-turn—volunteering before consultation—tightens the pattern without causal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine—letter summons Elena, vineyard metaphor reframes their history, dawn bus delivers parting—is lean and legible; closure achieves Charged Poise where cost is the unbridgeable space between them, echoed by the empty bus. Amber lanterns, fog, and skeletal vines recur as setting anchors; orientation lands by 80 words. No causality breaks; the mismatched-grape logic elegantly reweights the failed relationship. One near-flaw: “learning to honor the space” is somewhat abstract; crisper bodily cue could have nudged it into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whisperfield calm resettles with undeniable social cost—people must “keep noticing” or lose the clearings. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through repeated “pockets” until the final re-consecration reweights meaning. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last image of “snow.” Orientation is clean by line 3 (“three days… beneath the dunes”). No causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed arcs become a communal archive whose cost is the visible surrender of private grief to shared imagination—“reluctant to leave this place where broken things bloomed.” The causal chain is thin—Margot’s invitation directly causes the drawing—but the accumulative pattern (each layered sketch tightens the stake) holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara chooses testimony, accepting that language must break to bloom—earned, resonant, legible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The sonic library and crystal reweight meaning in the final image; no causal turns are missing, and orientation is anchored by line 7.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the compass of driftwood and chalk palimpsest become a “monument to… futures he would never fully inhabit,” reweighting the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: density of fog, chalk, tapes, tide layers until the final crystallizing image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) nailed by word 40. No causality breaks; the forgetting curse is the persistent constraint shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the still-spinning hand reweights the entire premise—capture becomes witness, cost is the moon’s measurable distance. Causal chain holds: tremor → orbital decay → recalibrate → spin accepted. Orientation clean by 120 w. One meaningful tightening: “old parameters are gone” forecloses restoration. Persistent constraint (spinning hand) shapes every tactic; cost legible in final image. Lens (Causal) stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is clean: the broken vinyl halves held together create a Charged Poise image that reconfigures the estrangement without forced symmetry; cost is felt in the “not quite fitting but no longer separate” line. Causal chain is lyrical-accumulative: Maya’s music → letter → Rebecca’s arrival → joint listening, each beat adding texture rather than abrupt reversals. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“the hospice floated…”) and time/place remain stable; one soft ellipsis jump “thirty hours later” is legible under accumulative lens. No meaningful escalation for Maya herself keeps this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the luminous noon-shadow web reframes the whole premise, felt cost is the irreversible surrender of perpetual night. Causal lens holds: key→orrery→dawn is a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by word 80; no penalty. One minor slack: the “ancient equations” tethering the isle are asserted but never shown to fail or strain, so the stakes leap is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pulsing tooth reweights the rules with undeniable conceptual cost—Marianne accepts permanent liminality. Causal linkage holds: straw-body failure → garden reveals → Iris offers alliance → mother steps into cleft. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is cleanly established by word 60. No lens ambiguity; Situational pressure crystallizes stance. Persistent constraint—“live in the cleft forever”—shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren renounces celestial fire for gentled terrestrial light, the cost legible in “amber glass…safe for small hands.” Causality is accumulative/textural—each polished shard layers density until the final gallery reweights meaning; pattern taught early via “bring their light down.” Mist/grotto anchors who-where-when by line 4; no orientation debt. Transitions are absent (single-scene default), yet the lens holds without ambiguity through the last crystallized image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the two women walk deeper into the moss nave, the offer to “see the other patterns” crystallizing Maya’s irrevocable commitment to ongoing, public tending of grief. Causality holds because every beat flows from the viral confession to this new, self-imposed vulnerability. The notebook’s arrival is not coincidence but logical consequence—Chen explicitly credits the video. The felt cost is unmistakable in the line “her protected vulnerability cracked open,” foreclosing the option of safe anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell fragment, once a broken record of growth, becomes the emblem of refusal to forget. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each apparition layers density until the pattern breaks into the insight that “the question was false.” Cost is undeniable: she accepts the “sharp-edged and terrible” burden of memory. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“feral nexus”), and the reflective block is interleaved with on-page stimuli and micro-choices, satisfying BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s overnight fruiting is the visible cost/proof that reweights the village’s forgetting. The causal lens holds—every gear-turn is a because/therefore step—though the 19-year moon alignment is off-stage coincidence rather than earned pivot. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“verdant arbor”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. The final image of baskets-to-doors crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the copper plate’s return inside the hollow tree reweights the orchard’s “impossible spring” from abstract hope to mapped electrical persistence. Cost is legible in the wax seal and whispered promise—she surrenders her only artifact to the orchard, not to human eyes. Causal chain intact: logbook → starlight sheets → pattern → map → sacrifice. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60 (“subarctic crater floor”). Lens: Accumulative/Textural; density of light/discard imagery tightens toward final image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s first tick reconfigures the group’s emotional options and crystallises Marcus’s purpose. Causal chain is tight—angle-study → gear-rebuild → public reveal—each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 5 (“marble cavern,” “eastern passage”) and the lens (Causal) holds to the final image. Cost is palpable in the moment the survivors’ faces light up: Marcus gifts away his private obsession, foreclosing lone ownership of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she leaves the crystals behind, fractals stop multiplying, and the burner’s return to daylight reweights the entire mandala of sorrow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each burden’s arrival and calcification layers density until silence itself becomes the final accumulation. Causality is symbolic rather than sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“she could not stop weaving”) and paid off when she chooses to stop. Cost is legible in the line “she was becoming the trap itself,” where the price is perpetual containment of others’ grief.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the uneven bowl crystallizes the reconfiguration—she can now “hold what remains” instead of freezing what’s gone—cost is the visible bark patch and the relinquished illusion of permanence. Accumulative lens holds: each wood ring adds density until the final cut reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; causality intact; no late convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon stills, Mira merges with her ghost, and the music she thought lost re-enters—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric but traceable: each scavenged fragment tightens the stakes until acceptance becomes the only unbroken motion. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (carousel time, floating droplets) that pays off in the final stillness. One scaffold sentence (“Ambitions that would never—”) is trimmed by the drop of the wheel, keeping the beat intact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s fate is reframed from demolition to metamorphosis, with the emailed proposal as visible wager. Causal chain holds—each discovery (stains → flow map → overnight draft) is a because/therefore step. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene arc with one time-skip (“By dawn”) keeps structure tight. Cost is felt—she risks professional ridicule—but because the supervisor’s “no” is off-stage, the price is slightly less than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she cannot invent, therefore she walks to the sanctuary; because the crystals echo buried dreams, therefore she abandons denial. The Decisive Change—sketching the sunrise/sunset clock—lands with conceptual cost: the resignation letter is now “lighter,” a tangible forfeiture of secure identity. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are crystalline by line 3; the single transition from courtyard to return path is legible. One hairline slip: “the dream wasn’t abandoned anymore” is retrospective summary that slightly blunts the immediacy of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s stance crystallizes as she pockets the sundial, accepting the liminal invitation; conceptual cost is legible in the final image of “ordinary darkness.” Orientation anchor (canal deck, twilight) appears by ~90 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of architectural misdirection holds.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira’s re-sealing of the rope reweights every prior knot into a living filament of continuity, and the cost—she will remain the invisible keeper—is legible in the final white-out image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each revealed artifact thickens the pattern until the dock itself becomes a loom of memory. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 3. The rope-map could have tightened causality one beat earlier, preventing a bare 0.1 slip.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory fragment (fog-bound lanterns, bitter chrysanthemum scent, bronze leaves) layers until the crimson thread becomes the decisive re-pricing image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; the 120-word test is waived because late disorientation (the “geography of healing”) is paid off when the thread literally maps the return path. Closure is a Charged Poise: the silk bridge reconfigures the Duchess’s options—she can now choose to walk the hall again—with the conceptual cost of admitting she had never truly left. Persistent constraint: the visible absence of wounds on her palms keeps the price of exile legible to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the phoenix’s hybrid song re-weights the premise, proving beauty can include machinery. Causal chain holds: because they splice tech into the egg, therefore a part-metal bird emerges and sings a future that cannot be un-sung. Orientation is clean within 120 words: who (prince), where (palace chained to stalactites), when (post-mechanized dusk of the kingdom). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends causal, the decisive sonic event irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: black sand, coin, and lagoon images layer until the final suspension reweights “scars can sing.” Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the suspended sand reconfigures both women’s stance with undeniable social/emotional cost. Persistent constraint: Maya forfeits immediate duty (radio) to gift the coin, foreclosing future innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: breadcrumb pattern → fountains → constellation → glass box; each layer deepens density rather than causal chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fountains fill, memories disperse, city re-perceived—cost felt in Mira’s evolved skepticism and the city’s reclaimed voice. Orientation clean by word 60; no prop teleport. The slight drag comes from the release beat being narrated rather than physically triggered; still, the final image reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the brass gear tumbles away, recalculations complete, while the humans receive “impossible light” whose price is the Keeper’s endless vigil—cost is visible. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of arrivals → sacrifice → garden-light accrues until the image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“nebula garden”) and never breaks. One minor causality waver: the pod’s systems revive instantly without physics cue, but the fantastic frame buys it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon re-weighted from family heirloom to instruction manual for communal mourning. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of poems accrues until it reconfigures her professional creed. Cost is legible in her pledge to carve “gardens of collective memory,” forsaking solitary stones. Transitions are clean; orientation anchored by line 15. Causality holds under accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each inscription adds density until the pendulum bob becomes a charged object that reweights the town’s meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“tidal obsidian ridge,” “dawn,” “Maren”). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s silent act re-balances communal memory with conceptual cost: the town will unknowingly live by Thomas’s innocence. The only snag is a mild causality fuzz: how she guarantees the engravings will remain invisible yet influential; still, the image charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that re-weights “blithe organization” into a duty to exhume buried truths, at visible social/ relational cost tomorrow. Causal lens holds—chess failure → midnight silo decoding → seven graves. Orientation anchors (who/ where/when) arrive before 120 words; no penalty. Flag droop image early teaches pattern for the later tapestry flagging; velveteen gloom reprises as earned texture.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because she maps ignorance, therefore she writes to prevent it. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“Maren stood at its base…”) well inside 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change—she now carries the written future, foreclosing the option to stop or doubt. The geothermal vents and crystalline circuitry are persistent constraints that shaped her tactics and charge the final image; cost is the dawn spent and the bodily cramp, both legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dust’s luminescent speech reweights the famine itself; the causal chain (lyrics → method → mote activation → city-wide plan) is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the amber radio pulse supplies a visible constraint. One tightening beat suffices; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragmentation (missing skies, hands, tables) tightens until mask-vision reveals curated incompleteness; that deepening reweights Elena’s ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise—her decision to scatter “components of faith” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation, transition, and causality all serve the pattern; no beats break the taught logic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure is a clean Charged Poise: Marcus cedes the cog and commits to a subterranean archive, re-weighting both their options. Causal chain holds: because Karin arrives with a concrete threat of erasure, therefore Marcus reframes his hoarding into a distributed resistance. The mid-scene switch from confrontation to coalition could feel abrupt, but the “truth survives argument” line crystallizes the new equilibrium. Cost is conceptual—future labor, future danger—but the final image (“evidence would wait”) makes it legible.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: autumn light, zitter rosette, and humming townsfolk accumulate into a final Charged Poise image that reweights “vanishing arts” as living practice. Closure lands cleanly, but the absence of any on-page tightening choice by Mrs. Chen keeps cost conceptual rather than felt; the story tells us harmony is achieved instead of forcing her to pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Linear causal chain—seed, sprout, share—holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“different future was quietly taking root”) whose social cost is legible. Orientation clear by mid-page. The single-scene default met; no meaningful reversal or resource lost on-page, so escalation stays modest. Consequence is societal, not personal; that lessens the immediacy of cost but satisfies short-form scale.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: hoard-code → drones withhold → blackout → tower meeting → confession → new open-handed design. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s spoken answer publicly reframes the catastrophe and commits both characters to a costlier, inefficient future. The amber-lit planning scene undeniably charges the final image with felt social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the house “exhales,” reweighting the entire premise—houses need witness, not occupants. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (displaced objects → life) is taught by 25 % and pays off in the hush-cadence shift. Causal chain holds: orris root pocketed → altar arranged → house exhales → Mara walks away, each step irreversible. Cost is legible in the final image: she “touched the door frame gently,” a quiet forfeiture of ever living inside.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens dominates: the ampoule discovery triggers the statue’s testimony, which in turn forces Marina’s choice to ‘tell them everything,’ a decisive change that drowns the former narrative. Orientation is anchored within 50 words—‘beneath the waves… her oxygen gauge ticking toward red’—and the closure image of slow ascent with the poison vial reweights the entire premise. No off-stage resolutions; the telepathy is the established rule, not a late intervention. Cost is legible in the statue’s final stilling and Marina’s forfeiture of scholarly innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: each stair climb because she fled her proof; Castellano appears because her guilt summons him; sideways leap therefore ruptures loop. Anchors clear by line 4. Closure unit (CR): pressing “send” reprices her rule-set— career safety traded for reopened rupture-risk—conceptual cost undeniable. One causality blip: dice roll defying gravity is over-ruled as dream logic without pre-cue, but dream frame taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each saffron stroke layers memory-density until the canvas becomes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the city’s air. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3 and the greenhouse glass acts as both lung and lens—an object that constrains and charges the closure image. The final image of rooftop greenhouses “blazing with impossible languages” carries undeniable conceptual cost: the state can police speech, not moonlit pigment; closure is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald lens reframes the ice wall, turning static despair into actionable fracture—an image that reweights the entire premise. Causality holds: because Matthias dies → hives freeze → waterfall ices → city trapped; because Celeste curates loss → she mobilizes artisans → thaw begins. Orientation is swift (grotto, post-freeze, by line 5) and the single transition (museum → streets) is legible. The lens’s earlier discovery in a donation box telegraphs its payoff, so the final image feels prepared, not contrived. Cost is visible: dwindling flour, hoarse singers, bodily cold—resources foreclosed even as hope emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the hunger stone’s warning rewrites itself, drought can be mourned before it happens, causality inverts—cost paid by the fissure in the rock and Maren’s vanishing. Causal lens holds: because she re-engineered the yoyo with backward-clock gears, therefore the axle suspends, knots unravel, light sucks reality inward. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse, tide level, night). No plot amnesia; each invented physics quirk is set up, used, then priced.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: fear shrinks, clasp becomes trophy, photographic curse flips to weapon—cost is legible in the final image. Causal chain is thin: advisor appears, gives book, vanishes; Margot speaks aloud, fear materialises; no intermediate trial or failed tactic. Orientation is clean by word 80. Drive lens is Hybrid tilting to Accumulative; the escalation is a single density jump rather than because/therefore tightening, but the final reweighting justifies the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard drifts safely, borne by the backward current Maren alone trusts, re-weighting the story’s rule-set. Causal chain holds: fractal clouds → xylophone chord → copper lattice → leeward current diagnosis → anchor swap → survival. Orientation is anchored by word 60; driftwood platform, blue hour, and prophet role are legible early. One minor causality fuzz: “salvaged rope and desperation” is summary; we don’t see prior failures that forged her credulity in counter-intuitive tactics, so the anchor crews’ instant obedience feels slightly eased rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the tightening spiral pattern and widening crack reweight the stakes rather than cause-and-effect reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren’s resolve to crack the city’s certainty—crystallized in the turtle’s first shift under her whistle call; the cost is the literal fracture beneath her feet and the social exile implied. Orientation is clean by line 4; no caps triggered. One scaffold—“the city had accepted its imprisonment with disturbing ease”—is tolerated because it seeds the thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letter’s confession reframes national myth with visible social cost. Causal chain holds: rose petal → deadline → confrontation → transfer → publication plan. Hawthorne’s capitulation is the weak hinge; his shift from absolute guardian to cooperative donor is asserted via civic argument, not forced by a new pressure. Orientation is clean; ivy station anchors by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s decision to witness rather than extract the letters crystallizes his stance, reweighting the premise—he now carries unspoken histories instead of merely mapping erosion; the cost is the unquantifiable burden he invites. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sealed note increases the emotional mass he must bear, and the final image of tomorrow’s descent shows the pattern will compound. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One minor causality bump: the tide slackens “twice daily after the distant drawbridge rose for phantom ships,” a temporal cue that slightly over-compresses the river’s behavior, but it does not fracture the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each new stamped volume tightens the pattern until the hidden press is revealed. Orientation is swift—blackout, sunken library, table, lamp by line 5. Causality is light but coherent: blackout → analog method → pattern noticed → purpose renewed. Closure lands with Charged Poise: final stamp becomes her own vow, cost legible in the last line “marking her own beginning.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane adds density, the count-down number reweights the stake, and the final image of “another lantern flickered to life” crystallizes the pattern without forcing a causal twist. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (lantern maker, Vesper Isle, now). Closure is a Charged Poise: the cycle is unfinished but the cost—endless repetition—is legible, no off-stage rescue. Persistent constraint (853 left) shapes every tactic; the craft is the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each image—geode, aurora, circuit hiss—adds density until the final Charged Poise where Mira keeps searching, foreclosing closure with felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; transitions are seamless. The only slack is the late introduction of “unfiltered awakening” as label rather than event. Closure reweights the premise: the hunt itself is the irreversible choice, the station’s drift mirroring her refusal to land.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is crisp: pilgrim arrives → chip handed → star-trails map → drones launched → closure vow. Orientation clean by line 50. Closure is a Charged Poise: mission crystallizes with implied lifelong cost of global scavenger hunt. Lens holds as Causal; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the watch hand and driftwood reweight meaning in the final image, forcing Mara’s renunciation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact—every fabricated genealogy leads to the parents’ deaths and Elias’s confrontation. Orientation is anchored by word 60; terrace, shore, dusk are spatially stable. One shard only, so default scope is met. The slight deduction comes because Elias’s entrance relies on off-stage legwork rather than a causal trigger within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange completes, both soldiers walk free, and Katrin stays behind in charged poise—cost felt in her solitary exhale and the moonlit parapet. The causal lens holds: moon-phase clock drives the beat-by-beat timing, the drawer pull anchors generational trust, and every beat tightens the synchrony. Minor deduction: the apology/forgiveness framing is declared, not dramatized, so the trust leap hinges on exposition rather than shown erosion. Still, the image of the lone negotiator under apex moon reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: grandfather’s death → miscalculation → three-year stasis → Amy’s request → incremental yes → launch. The astronomical compass re-enters as both talisman and tool, its brass patina anchoring orientation within 120 words and later re-appearing to charge closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina decides “within the hour,” collapsing her avoidance into action. Closure lands as Charged Poise: open water, island ahead, stakes re-weighted; cost is felt—utility-pole certainty is gone, only fallible multi-system navigation remains.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly: Marcus refuses memory and chooses forward motion; the cost is the forever-loss of self-knowledge, felt in the luminous ripple that answers him. Causal lens holds: because he meets the Interpreter → receives the ball → sees the future fail → therefore reweights oblivion as acceptable price. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 3: “edge of the underground lake… bioluminescent algae,” beating the 120-word window. No lens drift; the final image is a deliberate refusal, not an open loop.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: fortune warning → repeated sightings of dissolving ghost → spice ritual → transformation → touch. Each beat tightens the option space; the orchard’s moonlit rules remain consistent. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the siblings walk together, neither alive nor dead, with the permanent constraint of her non-human form legible in the final image. The only minor abrasion: Tam’s early dialogue telegraphs the price before pressure peaks, slightly softening the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repeated tracing reweights the premise—time is not found but given—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern is taught by the first cloud-ascension image and returns in the final nursery light, cadence-shifted. Cost is legible: the glade’s “choking beauty” is relinquished for mundane cradle light. No orientation debt; who/where/when land by line 4 and the moon-anchored geography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative pattern—photograph shimmer-spectra layering toward resonance—and lands a Charged Poise: the ship lights dim as grief becomes portal, cost felt in the undeniability of ‘luminous emptiness’; causality holds under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lightning-bug release intensifies texture and reweights the stake of “having nothing left to give.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stride onward crystallizes her new role while foreclosing return to prior wealth; cost is felt in the emptied jars and the barefoot solitude. Causality remains intact: detour → recognition of pattern → final release → continuance. No orientation debt; black-sand/celestial anchors appear by line 9 and payoff at final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine holds: blackout ➜ coded sundial ➜ silent coup, each beat linked by visible paint and shared darkness. Closure lands cleanly with Charged Poise: the fort now glows “from within,” re-weighting the premise of guardianship. The cost is palpable in the image but not personalized to Maren—no wound, no named loved one lost—so the resonance stays conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is solid within 120 words; lens is straightforward Causal and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the Fibonacci spiral and aurora tighten density until the final stone reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—frictionless existence is not a problem to solve but a state to accept, with the visible cost of her grandmother’s unarrested slide. Cause remains coherent: each stone is an irreversible because/therefore step toward letting go. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each 20-minute cycle layers density until the final poem-in-envelope crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; transitions clear. Closure reweights silence into testimony with undeniable cost—“the archive they couldn’t erase.” One scaffold loop: “twenty minutes of…” trio teeters on template cadence but is pattern-taught early and pays off in final cadence, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: Bellini puzzle → Adelaine stalls duel → joint solution reframes violence into collaboration. Closure is a Charged Poise: the handshake and scheduled next week crystallize a new, cost-laden ritual. The sundial angle-to-music reveal lands with precise timing and felt price—Harwick sheaths sword, Adelaine accepts ongoing intellectual combat. No teleporting props or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlit planting accretes meaning until the final image reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the library floor becomes a garden she’ll never see bloom, crystallizing cost. Causality is lyric rather than strict—seed cache hidden before evacuation → moonlit sowing → futures unmoored from any single self—yet pattern is taught early and holds. One hairline slip: the “blooming resistance” macro-narrative is referenced but never tested on-page; it doesn’t rupture closure, yet keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s backward lurch and the husband’s cloud-born return reweight the terminal’s suspended now. Causal chain holds—because she splices lived memory into film, the magnetic fog re-orients, compasses lock, and temporality buckles. Cost is palpable: twenty lost years stay lost; the clock ticks forward only by retracing its frozen moment, a permanent scar in the mechanism. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via recurring twilight, ivory cracks, and clock ritual; final image deepens the pattern rather than explains it.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kima plants the seed, trading certainty for possibility, and the felt cost (“we lose the seed forever”) is on-page. Causal chain holds: dream data → mounting urgency → luminous doubt → planting; each beat tightens options. Orientation is clean—ridge, monsoon clock, sister arrive by line 100. One minor causality fuzz: the elders’ claim is neither verified nor falsified before she acts, but the story frames this as the very wager, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira accepts that restoration is horticultural, not archaeological, and the cerule horizon re-weights “color of unspoken apologies.” Causality is intact because the lace pattern literally instructs the pruning act that enacts this shift. The reflective load is high (~30%) but anchored to present tactile cues and alters her immediate tactics, satisfying the BRR exception. One small orientation wobble: we reach word 138 before the islet location is confirmed, but the delaying haze serves the final image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of scales glowing “like stars” reweights both neutron stars and butterflies as evidence of transformation after catastrophe, with undeniable conceptual cost—beauty persists only as trace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density of observation (dust → scales → classification → cosmic parallel). Orientation is immediate (“greenhouse roof had buckled... three weeks ago”), and every beat tightens the thematic coil without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the quiet forfeiture of spectacle for residue, dramatized in her steady hands at dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vera returns to her kiln, transformed by fire but not broken, with Galloway bound behind her—a decisive reconfiguration of power. The causal chain is tight: ledger → frost patterns → cave → gunpowder → confrontation → surrender-for-clemency deal. Orientation anchors (canyon, stars, kiln) are clear by line 3. The inferred lens is Causal, held consistently, with one meaningful tightening (discovery of gunpowder) that forecloses escape and forces reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by paragraph two and held rigorously: emotional heat maps accrue meaning until the final book crystallizes transformation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—silence redefined as music via bodily resonance—with undeniable cost (lost voice, lost passengers, lost future). Orientation anchors immediately in the conservatory with precise sensory cues. Every shard of backstory (ferry capsizing, shattered instruments) feeds the installation’s logic and culminates in the leather-bound thermal atlas.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcel enables the ghosts to release their vigil by restoring their sanctuary, foreclosing his own return to ordinary practice with palpable cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via dream imagery, object resonance, and atmospheric density, culminating in a cadence shift at installation of the lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “blessedly empty” dreams imply permanent psychic toll. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell’s ring crystallizes a new stance—intergenerational continuity over survival alone—with conceptual cost (sanctions vulnerability). Structure follows Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of anonymous aid intensifies until rupture at the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (wisteria perfume, sparks, inverted light) intensifies until the climactic vision of golden threads reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“Every act of beauty is someone's unuttered love, transformed”—with undeniable conceptual cost (the acceptance that love persists but not as possession). Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; the viaduct, twilight, and jade pendant function as causal constraints shaping tactics and final offering. The past-life memory isn’t backstory filler—it triggers the present quest and is resolved through transfiguration, not recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lyra reweights time from linear loss to hyperbolic architecture, with undeniable cost—the erasure of her photographic anchors. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via density increase (photographs transforming, mazes unfolding) until the final image crystallizes options: she becomes both designer and designed. Orientation is immediate (“Lyra walked its moss-slick spans”), and the halo fragment’s payoff is rigorously set up. Cost is legible in “the photographs were gone, but she didn’t need them anymore”—a charged poise that forecloses her old mode of anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s liberation is not escape but recommitment to earth, making freedom legible only through stewardship. The causal chain is tight—bench keys → coordinates → arrow → seeds—with each step motivated by prior setup. Cost is felt in her continued binding to a scorched future, crystallized in the final image of kneeling in cracked soil.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Maya reinterprets her entire arc—not as theft but apprenticeship—when moonbeams reveal her future as creator. The Causal lens holds tightly (“because she stole portraits, therefore she was being trained”), with each beat narrowing options until the jar’s return forecloses her old path. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: she leaves behind the satchel that defined her, walking toward an untested identity. Orientation anchors instantly (“golden-hour portrait thief at Emerald Station”), and the drive remains coherent through moonrise.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density in recurring motifs (ice, glass, silence) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus shifts from solitary narration to intentional outreach. Cost is legible in the abandoned bookmark and the relinquished sanctuary—“releasing what we’re holding too tightly.” Orientation is immediate (“abandoned control room,” “Marcus,” “April sunlight”), and closure crystallizes as Charged Poise: he holds the sphere, ready to reconnect. The river’s thaw mirrors internal transformation without mechanical symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Maya enters because Emma gave her the cast; she stays because vulnerability sharpens her perception; she acts because the decrypted truth demands exposure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya walks into the dark holding truth, foreclosing anonymity but gaining agency. Cost is legible in Reeves’ shattered relationship and Maya’s irreversible commitment. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.
