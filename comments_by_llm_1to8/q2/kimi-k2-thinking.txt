  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory particulars (watermarks, mold, butterfly scales) and uses them to reweight Elena's understanding of decay and drama. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the radio telescope's decay patterns reconfigures her professional lens with visible cost (she will "begin again" with a changed method). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from seeking pure signal to hearing both signal and noise. Cost is conceptual and felt but slightly abstract—the story tells us she will admit "some questions required not answers but acceptance" rather than showing that admission on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (canyon, glass artist, recent attack) arrive early. The piece attempts a two-shard accumulative structure: canyon discovery → workshop return, but the closure lacks visible cost—Kael walks out with ledger, shard, and resolve intact, no option foreclosed on the page. The frost-as-map and furnace discovery feel convenient rather than motivated by prior choices. Under an Accumulative lens, the final vessel creation and departure should reweight the dominant stake (survival vs. vengeance vs. inheritance), but the ending offers parallel satisfaction without a decisive tightening or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (conservatory, post-capsizing silence, Mara with tuning forks) within the opening third and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: three tuning-fork strikes deepen the emotional heat-map pattern until the final image reweights silence as "canvas" rather than void. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final paragraph reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—Mara closes the case, promising "music yet to be born." However, the tightening is more additive than causal; each fork strike layers color without narrowing options or risking failure, and the cost (brother's loss, her own isolation) is established early but not visibly paid or traded at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lens fragments accumulate pressure through dreams, material gathering, and assembly until the library shudders and transforms into a permanent beacon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the undertaker accepts an eternal role with visible cost ("silence that would never quite catch them"). The cost is conceptually legible but lacks a sharp physical or relational price on the page that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.7)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual, stories, bell returning across beats), but the closure lacks a decisive image that reweights prior material with visible cost. Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is present (arbor, ridge, exile community, midnight). The ending disperses into summarized future nights and a declarative vow without a final beat that makes before/after legible. Cost proof test fails: no exact on-page sentence shows a felt price at the closure moment—only thematic assertion. Apply −0.6 for missing cost proof and −0.4 for closure that summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric patterning, but the closure—Mira realizing unused love was "within" and walking into fog "healed"—lacks a legible cost or decisive reconfiguration. The viaduct corridor, firefly memories, and breathing ritual unfold without narrowing options or altering tactics; the "release" is asserted in summary ("She let the unused love flow back") rather than dramatized. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough to waive penalty, but the escalation remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words (Elara, garden, midnight pruning). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layers of memory and geometry build density until the final disintegration. Closure is present—Elara becomes part of the garden's memory—but the cost is asserted rather than shown in a decisive image; "understood too late" and "began disintegrating" tell the transformation rather than letting a concrete final action or sensation land it. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks sharp on-page proof of felt cost at the exact moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is acceptable: who (liberator), where (carnival redemption center), and when (present moment with "wall comes down" as timeframe marker) anchor by the opening paragraphs. The causal lens holds through the piano-key puzzle and sentry confrontation, but the closure lacks legible cost: the liberator kneels to plant a seed "triumphant," still chained, with no visible price, forfeited path, or meaningful alteration to his stance. The final image ("his chains a map, ready for the next horizon") gestures toward resonance but delivers only assertion. The Cost Proof Test fails—no sentence in the ending beat shows what he has lost or risked beyond what was already declared at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers absences, artifacts, and memory imprints toward a final reconfiguration when Lyra hears the sought frequency and understands trust as cessation of transmission. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The closure—Lyra releasing the device and reframing betrayal as "stopped transmitting"—constitutes a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (renunciation of the search, acceptance of irretrievable silence). One substantive friction: the forge's sudden reignition feels convenient, arriving without prior setup or cost to enable the climactic hearing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful closure occurs on the page. Lux acquires the portrait, decodes it via convenient moonbeams, boards a train, and promises to chase more portraits—a serial setup rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The "fleeting golden sunset" time constraint evaporates without consequence; she acts "swiftly" yet faces no ticking clock or price for delay. Causality is convenient: flower code, hidden panel, moonbeam inscription, and painted door all unlock in sequence without resistance,误判, or tactical trade-off. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—touches of accumulative texture, causal unlocking, and situational mood never cohere into a dominant pressure that the ending can resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Marek, abandoned control room, spring thaw, established by the opening lines. The accumulative lens holds: thaw imagery deepens from seasonal detail to emotional metaphor, culminating in the bowl filled with meltwater and the floating bookmark—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the crack becomes "an entrance" and cost registers as acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marek discovers the new leak and creates "The Reservoir of Unasked Things." The gauge flicker at closure reweights prior stasis with quiet consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within scope, and the escape sequence follows a causal chain: decrypt cast → disable AI → crawl through hatch → emerge → depart. However, the core closure—Mira leaving the shell and vowing to help others—lacks visible cost; she gains agency and a rescue shuttle without forfeiting a live option or enduring a felt price on the page. The "transformative betrayal" inciting incident is told in summary ("Caela slipped a file") rather than dramatized, weakening the pressure that should drive the escape. Under a Causal lens, the ending delivers a shift in stance but not a decisive change with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but the piece never deepens or tightens—it accumulates synonyms ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") without reweighting the stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the traveler "walked into the void" is told twice without visible cost or altered options. The closure unit is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (robot janitor, frozen courtyard, twilight, post-procedure), and the story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the looped timelines layer data, the violin's resonance deepens, and the final return to sweeping reweights the mundane with philosophical charge. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—J-3 resumes duties but with altered awareness; the cost is conceptual (accepting participation over origin-seeking). The loop mechanism creates a meaningful deepening rather than causal escalation, fitting the lens. One friction: the loops resolve abruptly ("looped timelines ceased") without showing how the violin's melting or the plucked chord mechanically ends them, creating a small causality gap at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The causal chain—lens reveals doodles, doodles map to timestamps, Elara presents evidence, confession follows—is legible but mechanical: each step functions as simple sequencing without meaningful tightening of options. Closure reads as Decisive Change (embezzlement resolved, trust restored) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; Elara suffers no visible sacrifice or foreclosed relationship. The projector's "hidden beam" that "flickered across the wall" in an empty lobby strains credulity (why would a static lens and tickets generate a moving image without a light source?), introducing a minor causality slip that doesn't break the ending but weakens trust in the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (marble polishing as ritual deepening), but the closure dissolves into summary and thematic echo rather than a single charged image with cost. The wilted rosebush discovery (~40% mark) could narrow options, but Silas's decision to reveal the marbles lacks causal pressure—the heirs simply agree, erasing stakes. Orientation is clean. The ending rehearses the premise ("gardens know their gardeners") across multiple paragraphs instead of landing one resonant reconfiguration, and the cost of revelation never materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Kael, Deck Seven, Persephone station). The piece accumulates pressure through sensory detail and magnetic convergence, then delivers a Conceptual Repricing: Kael sees timelines spreading sideways, proving her theory, though the data will be dismissed. Cost is conceptual (career risk, dismissal as "instrument error") and felt in "her mechanically warm hands now held a secret." One meaningful deepening when she pulls the lever and plunges the station into darkness, reweighting the dominant stake. Closure lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with undeniable pressure in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—water-stain imagery and recurring "in between spaces" build toward a reconfiguration at closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara plays the note, the ghost departs, possibility replaces mourning. Cost is legible (the ghost is gone, the muse no longer external), though the shift from ghost-as-muse to self-sustained inspiration is narrated more than felt. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (flooded pit, lanterns, antique program). One minor causality question: the program "began to bleed fresh ink" and forms images during play, but the mechanics of how ink blooms under sound are asserted rather than established.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the oracle's release of the truth's weight), but the closure lacks visible cost—the forgiveness and lifting of burden are declared rather than paid for on the page. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first 15% without deliberate pattern-teaching, though the disorientation does not serve closure (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending summarizes the emotional shift rather than charging a final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: beads, ghost shift, radio psychic fragments layer toward a final release. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias releases the trapped souls and commits to speaking the confession aloud. Cost is legible (he shoulders the memory's weight, ends the silence), but the valve-twist moment lacks friction; no on-page obstacle resists the turn. The causal link from father's confession to Elias's present探索 is clear, but the middle sequence (radio calls, ghost materialization) accumulates atmosphere more than it tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when arrive piecemeal across the opening third without early anchoring. The piece layers images (library, catacombs, refuge, swan, chamber) but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the ending restates her vow to continue witnessing without visible cost or option foreclosure. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence demonstrates cost paid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when early and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: music + eclipse create a resonant moment. However, the closure unit—Eleanor whispering the mother's name and then sleeping peacefully—reads more as a declared miracle than a change with legible cost. The ninety-second "suspension" is asserted rather than dramatized through concrete action or decision. The eclipse functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a narrative constraint that narrows options or forces a trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (the moment of recognition), but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (Elias, silo library, post-dream future) by ~150 words and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the discovery of diaries → pattern recognition → understanding of walls as dream repositories → cataloguing. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when Elias realizes he "had become the walls' newest story," reweighting his archival work as part of the migration cycle. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option is legible on the page. The probe/discovery sequence feels more like research documentation than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Mei Lin discovers the specs, realizes she can direct rather than predict, writes targeted fortunes, and the morning brings confirmation of her orchestration. Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper's quarters pub, post-closing) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—placing her own fortune and awaiting transformation—lands on the page with conceptual cost (forgetting her old name, becoming "someone new"), though the price feels more declared than dramatically enacted. One meaningful deepening (reactive prophet → active composer) is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors solidly by the second paragraph (tower, Miriam, Elias, possession countdown). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—layered silence, looping questions—and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the monastery's certainties are "subtly shaken," silence taught to speak in paradox. Cost is conceptual (undermining assumptions) but felt; the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entity slips away under paradox pressure, satisfying the length's demand.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, dawn) arrive early and remain stable. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens—building through image and atmosphere toward a symphonic moment—but the escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: "she had become the conductor of unheard symphonies" is stated three times without on-page evidence of what changed or what was lost. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration in name only; no visible cost materializes, and the final image (scrolls awaiting fortunes) resets to the opening state without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, when arrive by line 4 (waived). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of imagery meant to reweight the dominant stake—but no meaningful tightening occurs; the piece loops through synonym variations of "labyrinth = self" without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that alters options. The ending dissolves the protagonist into abstraction ("she had become its architect") with no on-page cost; the tablet "reconstitutes" and "runes rewrite," undoing any closure. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a felt or conceptual price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who and where by the cavern arrival and advances through a single transformation: Elara receives the needle, experiences the backward song, and leaves changed. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (her heart becomes "a resonant chamber"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase around the phonograph ritual reweights her numbness), yet the final image tells the change rather than showing a decisive trade-off or renunciation that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias's pursuit of quarantine data → bureau surveillance → lateral escape → courtyard refuge → pigeon dispatch. Orientation anchors quickly (storm recorder, pursued, rooftops, courtyard). The closure reads as Charged Poise: he releases the tube and re-enters the city "ready for the next storm," crystallizing his defiant stance with the promise that "truth would find its way." Cost is implied—he's marked as a target—but the final image ("walked on," "smiled," "a melody of defiance") presents confidence rather than visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The lens holds, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than materially legible on the page, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past the opening (who is this poet? what prison? when did he escape?) without clear payoff at closure. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the poet enters with a rope, considers weaving it into the wall versus carrying it, and then carries it—no reversal, no narrowing of options, no felt cost. The ending gesture ("he would again uncover layers") resets to the premise rather than reconfiguring it. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing is legible; the dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is never tested or risked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The "chronic hush" is declared weakened but no on-page action demonstrates this shift or its price. The violinist's ritual unfolds without obstacle or tightening; she collects wood, lights fire, plays violin, and decides to continue—a sequence without causal pressure or reversal. The orientation test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the accumulative lens never crystallizes a felt cost at closure. The final paragraphs loop assertive future plans ("she will continue") without present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (grotto, dealer, client transformation). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: amber imagery, static electricity, and borrowed emotion recur with mounting density. However, closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration without clear cost—the dealer's final reflection on "hidden heart" and "one day" signals longing but no visible foreclosed path or decisive change in tactics. The "borrowed truth" and "static hum" charge the final image, but the before/after stakes for the dealer remain conceptual rather than felt; the client exits, leaving the dealer in the same detached observational stance. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present, but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and tracks a clear Causal lens through the first half (envelope → investigation → meeting). However, the climactic meeting and ceremony resolution unfold through summary and convenient alignment rather than motivated beats; Caleb's immediate agreement and the dockworkers' ready support bypass on-page friction. The closure—Lena reflecting on cycles of compassion—asserts thematic meaning without a decisive on-page change or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The ending gestures toward continuation ("another cycle to begin") rather than landing a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through lyric repetition and pattern (arbor hums, shadows map lineage, reed sculptures multiply), culminating in the tag discovery and sculpture placement. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image shows Kael "grafted," his reflection fused with shadows—but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. Orientation is delayed: who Kael is and why he's at the crater emerges gradually across the first third, functional but soft. The search structure (dawn/dusk cycles, girl's teaching) provides accumulative pressure, though the solstice reveal feels timed by calendar rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through stacked imagery (canals, echoes, giant's breath) and the closure offers a Conceptual Repricing where Elara becomes the echo, reweighting the premise with visible cost (dissolution of the pendant, her permanence in the city's memory). However, the causal chain from striking the bell to becoming the echo is elliptical—"time shattered" and "she felt three centuries collapse" are asserted outcomes rather than motivated by prior rules. The cost is legible (she is no longer mobile, her folio blank) but the mechanics of transformation lack on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (dripping stalactites, mosaic patterns, glass eyes) and culminates in the doorway's emergence and Vesper's departure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the mosaic holds its breath, waiting, and Vesper vanishes into the tunnels, leaving the eyes as witnesses. Cost is conceptual rather than felt: she abandons direct pursuit of return in favor of creating "a space where loss could be held." The orientation is delayed—"after the orchard grew silent" establishes time, but who Vesper is and what she's doing remains abstract until the fourth paragraph, past the ~120-word anchor window; however, the lyric mode teaches this drift early enough that confusion does not persist. One meaningful deepening occurs when the eyes fuse to the stone and the doorway emerges, reweighting her project from retrieval to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered sensory detail and pattern (caching objects, the tape reel's history, the boy's incremental discovery). Orientation is clean by line 3 (subbasement, hour before sunrise, Mara). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy begins reading aloud, Mara tastes coal smoke again, and the final image crystallizes her ongoing intention with the felt cost of her invisible labor. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy finds the tape reel and sits on the blanket, reweighting Mara's seventeen years of methodical care into a moment of connection. The cost is oblique but present in her continued waiting and the sapphire hush thatframes her sustained invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (linden leaf, mossy trellis, rain, vines) and modulates through Elena's shifting relationship to control. Orientation is clear early (nursery, storm season, Elena's role). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (she moves from resistance to acceptance), but the cost remains abstract—no specific opportunity, relationship, or capability is forfeited on the page. The final paragraph's "transformation sustained her" tells closure rather than showing a reweighted stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern of convergence through recurring images (brooch, canvas, rain trails) and achieves a cadence shift when the painter sleeps and reengages her work. However, the closure moment—painting over the portrait—carries implied rather than dramatized cost; the final image reweights meaning but lacks a concrete on-page price that forecloses a path. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (tidal island, water wars, insomniac painter), satisfying the test. The exchange beat functions as a micro turn but does not meaningfully tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mounting sensory density, cave music crescendo). Orientation anchors pilgrim/cave/Lira by ~100 words. Closure attempt: Lira opens her hands, forces flow into pearl, balance restored—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, cost is asserted ("deeper awareness," "forever changed") rather than dramatized; no visible forfeited option or felt price appears on the page. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" recurs as a mantra without causal force, and the pilgrim's arrival functions as coincidence enabling the shift rather than protagonist agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern (collecting spray-samples over seven years, then aligning them via staggered intervals) and pays it off when the seventh sounding reveals voices and the navigator's story emerges. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the navigator receives "a transcript of his silences, each gap now a bridge"), and conceptual cost is legible (exile reframed as composition, not void). However, orientation debt persists: "who" anchors late (~"ocean-spray archivist," no proper name ever given), spatial grounding drifts (archive chamber introduced only at summoning), and the mechanics of how mist-samples align with the valve remain elided until final third. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; Q3 capped at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8, all categories at 8.3 per cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with purposeful atmospheric compression and motif layering. Orientation arrives adequately (who, where established by ~100 words; when at line one). The closure unit—touching the pillar of her own unspoken truth and recognizing herself as architect—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract: "feeling both terrified and absolutely certain" is emotional labeling without visible forfeiture. The phrase "This was her new start, mapped not in ink but in courage" directly states the thematic shift rather than landing it through image, undercutting the RR's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure is attempted through Lira's realization that "some truths are felt, not proven," but this conceptual repricing arrives as assertion rather than dramatized pressure with on-page cost—no path is foreclosed, no tactical shift occurs. The tile "fulfills its purpose" and the tower "becomes a sanctuary" through summary rather than causal linkage; the fisherman's healing is told, not shown. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but the drive lens wavers between accumulative (whale song mapping) and causal (tile unlocking memories) without cohering at closure. The piece reads as a sequence of declarations rather than because/therefore progression.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through prismatic imagery and philosophical weight toward a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (Althea, escondite, Kepler-442b) arrive early. The closure—her choice to merge and dissolve into "a thousand unanswerable questions"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (trading certainty for mystery). However, the causal linkage between solar storm → spatial mutiny → amulet alignment → dissolution feels ornamental rather than tightly motivated; the mechanics remain abstract. The ending reweights the opening boredom, but the cost reads more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Sam's transaction with the director represents a Decisive Change—accepting complicity in exchange for survival paperwork—with visible cost (seven more lies calculated on-page). Drive lens is Causal with situational elements; the ink pot discovery narrows options and the final exchange reweights Sam's moral framework. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first three paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sam finds the ledger instead of letterhead, forcing tactical improvisation that pays off in the director negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece anchors location and character by the first paragraph, satisfying orientation. However, no causal escalation or closure occurs: the stationer begins recording invented histories and continues without reversal, deepening, or visible cost. The ending shows the lamp dimming and the notepad resting—a poetic image, but neither a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, nor Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift, pattern break, or density increase tightens the stake at closure. Repetitive ritual without cost or transformation flattens into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Grid, survivor, containers) land by ~100 words; the pattern of fragment-collection is taught early and held. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the survivor places the box, watches it resist the tide, and stands "nameless, real," with the cost legible in the anchoring image—he has chosen weight over disappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison label's handwriting is recognized, reweighting his erasure. Pressure coheres through tidal rhythm and layered fragments, though some beats (stevedore's memory, customs agent's regret) feel ornamental rather than causally necessary to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens but never coheres around a dominant stake with legible cost. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is, why he's at this observatory, and what concrete problem he faces remain vague past the opening third. The "closure" attempts a Conceptual Repricing ("the riddle was the reader, and the reader was always becoming"), but it's asserted through abstract declaration rather than earned through scene pressure; no visible action forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence. The cello's resonance and the seashell's "cracking" gesture toward significance but lack causal grounding—nothing in the middle builds toward this release, so the ending reads ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The story teaches a pattern of encoded messages building community resistance, but closure lacks decisive on-page cost. Mira's final determination ("hopeful desperation turning into determination") is asserted rather than earned through a visible forfeit or crystallized trade-off. The phoenix mural and community readiness function as setup for future conflict rather than a closure unit that reweights prior stakes with felt price. Orientation is clear early; causality holds within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers moonlit imagery and chemical preparation toward a flare-bloom moment. Orientation anchors (crater inspector, lunar summit, nightwatch) arrive early. The hourglass grain falling triggers the flare, which illuminates the bloom—this is a tightening, but the cost remains abstract ("a moment that would never come again") rather than a forfeited path or altered option. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bloom captured, then wilted), yet the felt price is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with accumulative textural support: the navigation crystal fracture → patch → test → delivery sequence coheres cleanly, and closure lands with the drone restored and Miren teaching Kael via demonstrative action. The *Prospect*'s departure functions as external clock tightening the repair window. Cost is understated but legible: the all-night labor under deadline pressure and the transfer of the repaired tool into uncertain expedition hands. Orientation is swift (repair shop, Miren blind, depot setting by line 2).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (condensation patterns, phrasebook dog-ears, recurring "nishan") and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Kael becomes the source, the rivers flow with his word. Orientation anchors (outpost, frozen lake, dusk) appear promptly. However, the closure unit relies heavily on metaphor ("passed through him like an idea through silence," "He was the map now") without a concrete on-page cost—no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical narrowing. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where the price of stepping into the water is legible beyond poetic assertion. This caps the score despite the coherent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through the archway's frequency, the tuning fork's absorbed memory, and the footsteps' rhythmic pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the cobblestones shift and buildings remember. The cost is conceptual—the town's survival depends on another century or two of faithful steps—and the final image ("the ghost town breathed") reweights the opening hum of death into possibility. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The accumulation is legible, though the middle section recycles the setup (walking, listening, memorizing gaits) without a meaningful pressure increase until the strike of the tuning fork near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (underwater temple, dying oxygen, distress signal) within the opening beat and tracks a clear causal spine: vial → temple unsnarls → core revealed → helmet cracks → transmission sent. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (death for data). The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture; the "gathered hush" accumulates meaning across beats and the final transmission crystallizes sacrifice. Minor causality slip: the helmet crack arrives conveniently at peak moment, and the vial's mechanics ("dissolved the knot") gesture toward magic without fully grounding the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors drift across the first third (spiral corridor, chapel, door, staircase, chamber) without stabilizing into a coherent spatial frame past ~120 words; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—his spoken story sealing the chamber "before they find the bodies"—lacks visible cost or a legible change in options; the lattice glows and he leaves, but no prior setup constrains this outcome or makes refusal impossible. Drive lens is ambiguous: the prose gestures toward accumulative texture ("copperlight repose," "chasing hush") yet promises causal pressure ("before they find the bodies," the narrow door mechanism), but neither mode lands cleanly at the end. The chamber scene could be causal if the bodies and the timeframe mattered on the page, but they remain vague and do not tighten his choices or exact a price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear early (greenhouse, Elara, ghost). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ghost's ephemeral visits layer until the bead placement triggers luminescence and rebirth. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard awakens, the ghost dissolves, debt repaid), but cost is diffuse—Elara "mourns a love she never knew" without forfeiting a present stake or altering her own options. The final beat dissolves into atmosphere ("each fruit bearing the sweet bitterness") rather than a sharp, irreversible change. Under the chosen lens, one meaningful deepening (the bead fuses, life returns) is present, meeting the minimum for this length, but the felt price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers motifs (red canyon, silver thread, orchids, tide pools) seeking a pattern-break or cadence shift to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors appear late—who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of abstract imagery. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tapestry becomes a map, villagers see beauty in broken precedents), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page sentence shows what Elara forfeits or loses by creating the tapestry. The final paragraphs summarize legend status rather than landing a charged image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (returnee, catacomb orchard, excavation task) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Lina traces roots, finds fragments, and restores the sundial, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sundial whole, her heart mended, journey continuous). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—twenty years, war, lost home—reweighted by the final image of shadows lengthening and a promise of return. One meaningful deepening occurs when the star-map wedge is found and fitted, recharging prior wandering. Minor cost-visibility issue: the conceptual price is strongly implied but the exact sentence where cost is felt at closure is diffuse across the final two paragraphs rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes setting and task by ~120 words (Orientation Test satisfied). Drive lens reads as **Accumulative/Textural**: pressure builds through layered detail—chalk marks, micro-dot instructions, the ticking clock—culminating in Kael watching Mira depart with the encoded letter, a charged poise moment where options crystallize. However, the closure cost remains conceptual and oblique; we do not witness a visible forfeit or tangible consequence that alters Kael's future options. The "moment before the letter is mailed" functions as a frame but does not tighten choices on the page—Kael completes the commission without setback or meaningful revision. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("the margins would remember") asserts resonance rather than dramatizing a reweighted stake.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through pattern, metaphor density, and cadence rather than causal turns. Closure attempts a Charged Poise—Mira steps forward with the secret, crystallizing her stance—but the cost is more asserted ("the echoed silence held its breath") than felt in a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint. The conspiracy unfolds largely in summary ("hidden meetings and coded messages") rather than through on-page beats that narrow her options, weakening the reweighting at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (swamp, protagonist paddling, singing spirits) arrive early. The closure—reading the letters aloud and releasing them—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the apology becomes irreversible act) with visible cost (the letters are sent, the silence broken). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard glows and the protagonist kneels, narrowing options. The reveal of the sister's death at line 23 arrives late, creating slight retroactive motivation rather than forward pressure, but the accumulative design absorbs this. Escalation is present but gentle; the piece deepens rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final gesture ("I kept your number too") reweights abandonment as mutual preservation with undeniable emotional cost. Pattern taught early (coral/cast/translation motif) and paid off in final image. Orientation anchored by ~60 words (anesthetic, gurney, hospital). One meaningful deepening via decryption that narrows the guilt/forgiveness axis.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Lyra, warehouse, orchard district) within the first 120 words and follows an accumulative/textural lens: fog → discovery → re-creation → display → shared wonder. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra steps back at dawn knowing "the fog would return, but now it would carry the scent of blossoms, not decay." The cost is implied rather than visible—no path is foreclosed on the page, no tactical choice altered. The final image reweights the premise, but the emotional price remains diffuse across dozens of lines rather than crystallized in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost. The mural "reveals" layers and Elena "realizes" restoration is wonder, but no option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The visitor's laugh setting "the next layer aglow" is a coincidence-driven continuation, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Inferred lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply extends the pattern. Apply −0.8 for closure validity failure and −0.5 for cost illegibility.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-situational hybrid lens: the Cognition Revenue Act creates pressure, the gourd seed encodes resistance, the auditors arrive as consequence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. The closure unit is a Charged Poise (auditors leave thwarted; defiance flares brighter; tomorrow the vines will sprout) but the cost remains conceptual and future-tense rather than paid on the page. The auditors' departure—"thwarted by their own technology's inability to parse the grammar of the natural world"—reads as authorial convenience rather than earned dramatization, weakening the closure's felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a coherent closure unit with cost. The blossom armistice "holds" across repetitive assertions without a decisive tightening or reweighting that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The ending loops prior material ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") without a final image that reconfigures stakes or meaning with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who and where by the second paragraph but operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens that never achieves a decisive tightening or cost. The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—cycles through synonym loops ("preserve the sound," "echo," "light," "kept alive") without escalation or closure choice. The final paragraph ("gentle systematic rhythm…continued to light") reprises the opening tableau without reweighting options or meaning, yielding a loop rather than Resonant Reconfiguration. No visible or felt cost appears on the page; "foxglove regret" remains an assertion rather than a dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean by the second sentence (who, where, when). The piece follows a causal lens: Elara writes promises → pneumatic delivery → Kess responds → meeting → reconciliation. Closure occurs on the page (trust restored, divergence accepted) but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized—"divergence" is stated, not felt. The "symphonies of truth" mechanism works as a constraint early but then dissolves into metaphor at closure, weakening the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The drive lens reads Causal (discovery → transcription → proposal → vote), but the council's acceptance lacks meaningful resistance or reversal—Alia presents, they vote, construction begins. The closure lands (the amphitheater lives, harmonizing past/future), yet the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a specific forfeiture or consequence Alia faces on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (the message reveal), but escalation flattens after that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust-mote patterns and meteorite warmth recur, and the final pigeon release with ledger closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors late—Elias's role and the woman's disappearance emerge past the 20% mark—but the attic frame holds. Cost is atmospheric rather than legible: the "fragile trust" and "promise" are asserted, not demonstrated through a foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the customer's matching tune), but causality remains associative rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens reads accumulative/textural: repeated threshold crossings and grain-reading gestures layer toward a conceptual endpoint. Orientation is delayed—"who" clarifies only at line 3, "where/when" remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure ("I know now that some distances are necessary") is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reweights prior material through action. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric recurrence but never pays it off with stakes-altering pressure at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Iyana descends, discovers bioluminescent patterns, recognizes the city's "transformation," and chooses to remain. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she renounces evacuation with visible cost (her life as a surface human). However, the "transformation" mechanic is never grounded in concrete action; the feather "begins to glow" and she "synchronized" with the city, but the reader never sees what bodily or perceptual change occurs. The final image of her "transformed existence" and the AI sustaining it feels conveniences rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (sea-foam recollectionist, coastal paths, crater glass shard). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lira gathers clues, plants seeds, assembles fragments, and the final image reweights the premise (paths are not lost but transformed). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"every path that disappears simply becomes part of the sea's endless recollection"—but the conceptual cost remains abstract; no visible on-page price forecloses a tactical option. The assembly sequence (shard → seeds → fragments → tide pool) follows a quest-log structure with minimal tightening or deepening that changes options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal (because/therefore linkage through Ezra's interventions). Orientation anchors quickly (who/where/when by the opening). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"wilderness had been tamed by calculation"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what Ezra sacrificed or what path he foreclosed. The bishop "pulsed with warmth" gestures toward resonance but doesn't reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening is present (the guard's redirection) but the stakes never narrow options in a way that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern or pays off elision with cost. Orientation is delayed: "who" (Lyra) and "what" (tide dancer) arrive early, but "where" (the garden's stakes, the world's ban) and "when" (timeline relative to the ban) remain vague past the 120-word mark without functional payoff. The closure unit—Lyra stepping beyond the garden as a living poem—arrives as summary assertion ("her skin a map of celestial poetry") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The "spontaneous anchor" that roots her is released off-page with no visible price. Orientation penalty (−0.4) applied here; Q3 capped at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit. The glazier walks to the pond, reads ripples, gains insight, returns to work, and later teaches others—a sequence of observation and resolution without visible cost or a before/after that makes a decision or renunciation concrete. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural by default, yet the final paragraphs simply restate the opening premise ("the secret to a perfect pane was not in the cutting, but in the seeing") rather than reweighting it through dramatized pressure. Orientation is anchored early (Pearl Bay, dawn, glazier), waiving that penalty, but causality remains decorative: because he sees ripples, he feels affirmed, with no narrowing of options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: moonlit walk → stone circle → ash release → dawn writing attempts pattern-building toward thematic weight. Orientation anchors arrive (moonlit ridge, thirteen years post-fire) but the spatial journey lacks clear transitions between ridge arrival, kneeling, departure, and station return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: teaching becomes the vessel for carried pain), but cost remains abstract—"weight shift from hands to shoulders" tells rather than showing a foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening of options occurs on the page; the walk enacts a pre-decided ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (grotto, Kael, three years of work) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through shell-pattern creation, gauge readings, and the autumn-equinox breakthrough. Closure arrives when the coefficient (9,847 feet) is discovered and seventeen timelines shift into "harmonic convergence," followed by a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraphs (the balloons launch empty; Kael herself was the final trial balloon). However, cost remains largely told ("even in rest…constant recalibration") rather than felt on the page, and the climactic mandala assembly lacks immediate friction or agency—she arranges fragments "automatically" and the needle simply "held steady." The transformation feels declared rather than earned through on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the opening, applying a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through its layered objects and echoes, but the final turn—Mira's decision to share the findings—lacks a dramatized moment where she weighs and forecloses an alternative path. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from mourning to action), yet the cost is conceptual and summarized ("legacy's burden transformed") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or conflict on the page. Backstory dominates the middle third without micro-choices that tilt present stakes, flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the painter arrives, sings, the mirrors shimmer, the bells ring, she fades. The closure—mirrors returning to ordinary selves with faint glimmers—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page; the painter's blurring is frictionless, a repeat of her nature rather than a forfeiture. One meaningful tightening occurs (the approaching bells), but the escalation is temporal rather than driven by protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a ceremonial/ritual pattern through the terrace, clipboard, and planetary alignment, building toward a collective signing. Orientation anchors promptly (terrace, negotiator, midsummer). However, the closure—leaders signing after a mystical hum—lacks visible cost or a concrete image showing what path is foreclosed; the "fragile triumph" is told, not dramatized. The negotiator walking away does not reconfigure the dominant stake with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous journey across the salt flat, fitting the 600–800 word default. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the echo is preserved while the drought's cost is buried, reweighting Vesper's philanthropic gesture. However, the cost is told ("the drought had displaced villages") rather than felt in the closure image itself; the final paragraph summarizes legacy ("Vesper's story became a legend") instead of landing a decisive on-page moment. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of cracks, echo, erasure), held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layered images (snow, starlight, prism, echoes) build toward a pattern-break moment when the sanctuary unlocks. However, the unlocking itself lacks visible cost—Elara dances, threads yield, voices bloom, and the city changes without on-page resistance or price paid in the closure beat. The ending shifts to summary mode ("her legacy had just begun," "tomorrow she would be hunted") rather than landing a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence. The causal chain from dance to liberation reads as assertion rather than dramatized escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increase through layered backward-told tales building to the final image of Adrian tracing "a signature in negative space." Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final act of un-telling reweights the premise—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt; we're told the audience reacts but the price to Adrian himself (beyond "the hush now his only companion") is asserted, not dramatized. The because/therefore linkage between individual puppet tales and audience transformation is loose; coincidence (the right people happen to be present) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images and the moth wing accrues meaning across beats, culminating in a charged final moment when the monarch appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the temporary-signal motif and reconfigures the weight of witnessing—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation is delayed: "she" appears without name or grounding for several lines, though the verdant grotto anchor arrives early enough to waive penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moth wing becomes the signal that draws the monarch, but causality is loose—why this signal, this moment, this butterfly?

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images—aurora, rope, names—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she commits to remain and preserve) with felt emotional cost. Orientation is clear early. However, causality is thin: the rope "clicks into place" and names emerge without prior obstacle or failed attempt, so pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. The closure reweights her exile into calling, but the cost is declared ("thawed") rather than shown as a foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers image, memory, and insight toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~100 words. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara emerges into the storm, the bunker collapses, and she becomes "precisely nothing and playfully everything"—a conceptual repricing of her role. Cost is legible but oblique: she drops the fox stamp, the bunker dies, her old directive ends. One small causality slip: the dream's revelation ("directive decays by design") feels expository rather than discovered through scene pressure, slightly weakening the earned quality of her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the first two paragraphs, meeting the baseline test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ten nights of calculation build density toward a final schematic revelation and activation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tile vanishes, dispersing knowledge into starlight, and Kael's scribbled papyri endure)—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page; we are told the tile is gone and knowledge dispersed, yet no prior material is visibly reweighted by this disappearance. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds it through the ending, but the final image lacks the undeniable pressure required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mira is, where the sanctuary exists in relation to any world, and what "reality shifts" mean remain vague past the opening third, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (reality shifts, cellular memory motifs), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—Mira simply lectures Elara, who dissolves without resistance or cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (Elara's release), but the cost is invisible: no on-page forfeiture, no tactical narrowing, no felt price in the final image. The ending recycles the opening setup ("prepared for the next shift") without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through mirrored imagery (glass, frost, starlight) and teaches a pattern of boundary dissolution that pays off when the sextant channels the dream into the orchard. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the orchard's transformation and Kael's merger with it, reweighting the opening fog-shrouded ruin. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael shifts from searching to synchronizing breath, narrowing his method and opening the dream's approach. Cost is legible in the image of trees transformed and Kael "as much a part of the landscape as the trees," though the price reads more conceptual (loss of separateness) than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal turn. Orientation is established early (abandoned cathedral, orchard in rafters, quartz-eye mender). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon shifts from binding to bridge, the daughter's arrival and their reconciliation reweight the opening contract breach. Cost is visible—the mender's years of neglect, the broken relationship, the physical labor—and the final image (ribbon on her wrist, trees breathing) charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daughter appears and the ribbon's function transforms. However, the "years that followed" summary undercuts the on-page closure moment by explaining rather than leaving the reconfiguration to resonate, and the squirrel encounter, while charming, does not advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through image density and pattern (orchard as language, shell as memory key, bathroom as clarity space) toward a conceptual repricing where the orchard is revealed as memorial garden. Closure lands on page with cost—Evers accepts his role as mourner knowing the "terrible beauty"—and the final images reweight prior material. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The weakness: the middle section's escalation reads more as information reveal than tightening pressure; the bathroom breakthrough feels like a exposition delivery system rather than a beat that narrows options under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Causal but linkage is weak: the diary's gaps function as a cipher only by authorial assertion, and the warden accepts terms without dramatized negotiation or cost. The closure—emerging into dawn with the diary complete—offers no visible price or foreclosed path; the "unheard symphony finally audible" is metaphoric summary, not an on-page reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late (~150 words) but the fantasy frame mitigates confusion. The rescue succeeds via convenient plotting: the healing incantation appears without prior setup, and the library grants knowledge freely.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a situational lens—Mira navigating the ship toward the garden—but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal. The garden is found exactly where sought without complication; her "realization" that solace was already within her arrives as assertion rather than earned through dramatized events. Orientation is provided early (who, where, when by ~120 words). The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she chooses to stay) but the cost is conceptual and not legibly felt on the page; no prior live option is foreclosed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara traces anomalies through escalating discoveries (seal → records → tower → hidden door → ceremonial rope) that converge at the weaving act, where merging the phantom thread completes history "with surgical precision." Orientation anchors emerge by the seal discovery and tower room, satisfying the test. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing—the fable of absence becomes presence, history "completed itself," and the clock chime adds "a beat that only those who understood absence could hear"—with conceptual cost legible in the newly resolved paradox and the vanished door erasing prior continuity. One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves the thread and clock gears accommodate both truths, changing the institutional record and the student's fate; the cost is felt in the rewritten maintenance logs and the seal's new authenticity, though the emotional or social price to Elara herself remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 2. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated efforts (stone application, humming, crack alignment) toward a "bloom of hush" that unfurls twice. A Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands when "the bloom of hush would return, again and again, as promised"—the cave's cyclical nature is crystallized, and Lira's acceptance of the pattern reweights her role. However, the second bloom and the ending retread the first bloom's beat without meaningful cost or narrowing; the closure image ("She walked on, the caves humming softly") feels like a soft reset rather than a decisive tightening. Cost is implied but not legible in a specific sentence or image at the ending beat, triggering the cost-proof penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—"three winters after the collapse" and "beacon-tower" establish time and place, but who the custodian is remains vague past 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final light-column and convergence of three travelers reweight the opening premise with conceptual cost (belief restored). However, the closure unit relies heavily on coincidence (travelers arrive carrying exactly the knowledge needed) which complicates rather than resolves under Situational rules; the conceptual cost is felt but the causal path to that moment is thin. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands pattern, but the cost of this realization is abstract rather than legible in forfeited options.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece moves from observatory to forecourt and back, layering atmospheric details and memory fragments to deepen the archivist's stance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—"identity was not sculpted from experience, but from spaces where experience dissolved into meaning"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture makes a before/after legible with felt consequence. The final image of morning light and "deepening hush" offers atmospheric resolution without a decisive change or visible price that reconfigures options.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: "who" anchors by line one, but "where" (the fortress layout, archway location) and "when" (elapsed time from arrival to fire-spin) remain vague past 120 words, creating mild spatial drift without payoff at closure (−0.3). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light versus dark, chant-to-flame), but the ending merely loops back to the opening mission without a decisive tightening or felt cost—Cinder's heart "beats with the rhythm of fire" as it did before, and she walks on unchanged. The mosaic note ("Rise") is discovered but does not narrow options or reweight the stake; she was already committed to lighting fires. No reversal, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page; closure reads as circular repetition rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance stance crystallized), but the cost is atmospheric rather than legible: Mara's "understanding" and the brother's "acceptance" are told, not shown through a foreclosed option or visible price. The tide-pool metaphor accumulates across beats, but the final image reweights prior material only through abstract assertion ("the weight of transition lift"), not through a choice or renunciation that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.8)
    The gravity-inversion premise arrives without prior constraint or cost, functioning as a convenience gate rather than earned escalation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("prison could hold a garden") but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The accumulative lens is suggested by the silence-collection motif, yet the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it summarizes theme. Orientation is delayed past 120 words without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering (noise meter readings, storm glass states, prismatic light) and cadence shifts from the opening whistle through deepening quiet to the final turn of the terrace. Orientation anchors (Meridian Station, drifting prism terrace, Kael as gondola operator) arrive within the first 150 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael resets her instruments and waits, the work never finished, with the conceptual cost visible in her solitary, perpetual labor. The one weakness: the diplomat's boarding and immediate transformation compresses what should be a longer negotiation, making the central turn feel slightly unearned despite the atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles atmospheric fragments—acid rain, murals, ruby pulse—toward a final reconfiguration when the lore keeper places the flake and walks away. However, the decisive act (placing the ruby, choosing not to sit) lacks visible cost on the page; her "purpose fulfilled" reads as assertion rather than felt sacrifice, and the orientation delay (chronoshawl, nano-tube transitway, kaleidoscopic waterfall without spatial anchors until deep into the text) creates early confusion. The closure *lands* but the price remains conceptual and diffuse rather than sharp and undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; who the keeper is, where the sanctuary exists physically, and when this occurs remain vague throughout—applying the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration lands on the page; the final paragraph restates the opening premise without reweighting cost or foreclosing a path. "She burned bridges carefully, but she also built them, one breath at a time" is thematic summary, not closure with felt consequence. The man's departure and return promise is a micro turn, but the keeper's situation remains unchanged with no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens infers as Causal-Hybrid with lyric undercurrents, but the closure unit is weak: the diamonds appear via pressure application, then are deposited in a fund without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. The owner "could only marvel," erasing potential consequence. Orientation is delayed—who Kael is and why he's at the farm emerges piecemeal across the first third—but the disorientation is not taught as pattern and does not charge the ending (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The quantum promise mechanism feels coincidental rather than earned; the glitchy texts guide without Kael wrestling with belief or trade-off. One tightening occurs (the bolt turn at bloom peak) but the aftermath diffuses rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, sepia reading room, evening) appear early, but causality is weak: the gramophone's standing waves conjure a visual silhouette and whispered name without prior setup of how sound creates images or why this particular melody unlocks genealogical truth. The closure unit—realizing his role is to remember rather than end—lacks visible cost; he simply leaves carrying the melody, with no on-page foreclosure of options or trade-off. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density of golden-shadow motifs), but the final reconfiguration is asserted rather than earned through pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (endless night, glass cathedral, no concrete spatial anchor or time marker). The closure image—Aldric drifting in void, marionettes now still—suggests Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise), but cost is asserted rather than legible: "withdrew" heart becomes "never alone" without on-page evidence of what path was foreclosed. Lens ambiguity: accumulative texture competes with causal "unsnap" action; no single lens dominates at closure. Per Orientation Test, Q3 capped at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marianne's broken heart eases "not by healing, but by the recognition that histories...settle in patterns that can be read." The accumulative lens holds—dust reading, button discovery, letter exchange—with each layer deepening the stake. Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Tuesday in March, Marcus Dwyer's box). The daughter's posthumous response provides felt cost: Marcus died believing he came from nothing, yet the gesture reaches those who remain. One meaningful tightening when the button's regiment is traced to Private James Dwyer.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure reads as Decisive Change (she retrieves the data and escapes), but the cost is thin—the System marks her erased, yet she reappears unscathed three days later with the network intact. The key-in-water mechanism arrives unearned; no prior beat establishes that the lagoon responds to objects or that her grandfather's key holds this property. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, and the escalation from theft to flight to reappearance traces a because/therefore chain, but the final image dilutes rather than tightens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by ~120 words, but the Causal lens never coheres—beats feel like parallel atmospheric tableaux rather than because/therefore linkage. The "prophecy dissolves" without dramatized mechanism or cost; we are told it is hushed but never see what options narrow or what price is paid. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist executes an unexplained ritual and departs. Closure lacks a legible decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation arrives slowly (who, where, what task by ~150 words) but the piece never teaches a coherent drive lens: events accumulate without causal links (dust appears, seeds transform, map points, prophecy unfolds) and no reversal or tightening narrows options. The "closure" is a declared fulfillment—prophecy complete, arbor blooming—without on-page cost or a before/after legible in Lira's situation or stance. Moonstone dust solves every problem it encounters, collapsing pressure rather than escalating it, and the final image is pure satisfied completion with no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: twelve clocks → compass rose discovery → underground mechanism → jamming the rose into the socket. Orientation anchors arrive early (workshop, greenhouse, underground). The closure unit—Elara jamming the compass and the mechanism settling—lands on the page with a visible action, but the cost is stated retrospectively ("learning to love the space between ticks") rather than shown as a foreclosed option or immediate consequence. The "learning to navigate by the moment" line feels like a theme summary rather than a dramatized reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (foundry, Elara, post-search). The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the coin ritual, zodiac naming, and the foundry's exhale until the final golden-shadow image reweights "the weight of names" with conceptual cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elara stops searching, the foundry's cracks are "painted by dawn"—but the cost remains implicit (the boy is not found, the search is abandoned) rather than sharply legible in a forfeited action or visible consequence at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Kael, Echo Gorge, hidden sunrise). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered confessions and the recurring harp notes until the child's fractured laughter arrives and Kael's own laugh creates a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: accepting brokenness rather than restoration). The crocodile's tooth falling marks the turn, and the final integration carries conceptual cost (relinquishing the ideal of perfect healing). However, the closure leans on stated realization ("understood") rather than pure image, slightly weakening the RR's charge. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: who Elena is, where this forest exists in relation to the interrogation, and what timeframe governs her survival remain unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (UV light, forest hum, pewter strap recur), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—she walks, remembers, recites, and concludes without a decisive change or felt cost. The ending assertion "mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived" substitutes for an on-page reconfiguration; no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed. Closure form (RR or CR) is attempted but lacks legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (market, translator, fragment) within the opening third and follows an accumulative lens: fragment → painting → journal → realization. However, the core "unfastening" beat (tracing the outline, finding the latch) occurs without prior setup of the mechanism or any failed attempt, reducing causal grounding. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the translator becomes keeper), but the cost—placing the fragment back, walking on—feels more symbolic than felt; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The accumulative design holds but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a pressure-charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, layered ghost arrivals, and discovered mainsprings build density toward the ringmaster's testimony, which reweights Marlon's role from repairman to witness. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ghosts dissolve after testimony, Marlon pockets one barrel, and the final image ("silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty") reconfigures his burden with conceptual cost. The shift from skillful observer to bearer of testimony is legible, though the cost remains largely implied rather than dramatized in a choice with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (frost, whisper, glass, rupture) toward a final reconfiguration. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the rupture opens "a new kind of order" that rewrites itself, and Elara's "Here" compresses eternity as promised. Cost is conceptual (the whisper spent, libraries shattered) but felt pressure at closure is muted; the ending describes transformation more than enacts it with visible stakes. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara releases the whisper, reweighting the stakes from preservation to expenditure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where the baroque asteroid sits in relation to governance, and what "visible time" means remain unclear past the opening third. The piece announces an archaeological dispute but never dramatizes a live constraint—Voss's archive filter is mentioned, not tested. Closure reads as thematic resonance (the poem revealed, Voss nodding) without a decisive on-page cost; Kael's options remain unchanged, his exile and chronicling project unchanged. Under an Accumulative lens, the pattern of covering mirrors recurs but does not tighten or reweight stakes at the end—it simply repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (rust healed, song restored, dawn returns) with conceptual cost legible in the woman's transformation. However, orientation anchors arrive slowly: who/where/when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of atmospheric setup, costing −0.3. The ticking-clock pressure ("eleven chimes") and the chip-tethering action do tighten options, but the resolution feels largely procedural—no visible tradeoff between competing goods at the final beat. Cost is present (covenant broken, woman freed) but arrives as declarative outcome rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (vials, compass memory, lagoon's temporal strata) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: Mira becomes keeper, boundary marked by petrichor circle). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the loading dock opener. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she empties her vials, abandons the expedition compass, carries only memory). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon "remembers" after the petrichor drop, reweighting the stakes from personal archive to threshold-guardian. Causality remains loose—why this lagoon responds to petrichor, why the compass spins now—but the Accumulative lens tolerates pattern over strict because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: GPS failure forces old-path navigation, lantern slide reveals layered carvings, Mara carves and places token, ancestral connection solidifies. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of figures stretching into mist reweights her role from solo sculptor to timewoven node. The cost is conceptual (accepting she is one link, not unique) and legible in "they were the same node" and "the alliance was not just with the past, but with the future she would one day join." One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide reveals hidden etchings, narrowing her understanding of the work's purpose. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (lyric mode with recurring images). Orientation is delayed—"who" and "where" anchor by ~150 words but "when" (autumn/winter/spring cycle) remains vague until mid-story. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing: flowers bloom for the moon, not the sun. However, the cost is abstract—Sable's heart "blooms like the night flowers" is metaphorical assertion, not a legible forfeiture or stance crystallization on the page. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the final reconfiguration lacks felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story opens with adequate spatial and temporal anchors (zeppelin library, post-discovery), satisfying the Orientation Test. The causal lens is taught: diary → cipher → beach debris → translation → parley → joint disclosure. However, the key turn (the Under-Minister's recognition and agreement) is summarized in two sentences without on-page negotiation or visible cost at the moment of reversal. The final "truth released" moment lands as a summary of consequence rather than a dramatized Decisive Change; we're told the broadcast "would soon" happen and Elara "finally slept," but the cost remains abstract and deferred rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraphs and infers an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, closure remains diffuse: the bottle "shimmers," voices fill the cove, then fade, leaving "only the lanterns, the water, and Kael's steady breath"—no decisive change in Kael's situation, no visible cost (the bottle remains sealed as intended), and the claimed transformation ("reborn as a seed") is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a concrete image that reweights prior material. The final paragraphs summarize weeks of settlers arriving and a civilization growing, which functions as epilogue rather than on-page closure. The cost-proof test fails: no single sentence in the ending beat makes cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (rooftop orchard, Elias, post-foghorn). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: sensory details and ritual actions build toward the sealed vault. Closure reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise—Elias seals the prophecy and accepts the "velvet disquiet"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a legible forfeiture of options or a concrete price paid. The final image reweights prior material, yet the stakes never visibly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when), but causality is decorative: the egg hatches, seeds are scattered, and the vortex reopens in a sequence that reads and-then rather than because/therefore. The "choice" presented at the vortex—sustain it or let it collapse—is declared but never tested; Elara returns and the outcome simply unfolds. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The ending presents a static tableau ("the cycle would continue") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; the story announces renewal without demonstrating what was risked or forfeited to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The piece follows a single POV in one continuous scene (observation deck to bell chamber), meeting the 600–800 word default. However, closure reads as Earned Stasis (she chooses not to sound the alarm), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatically paid: "They would have fled their homes" is hypothetical, not an on-page consequence that alters her later options. The inferred lens is Causal (her reading of the instruments narrows her choice), but the final reversal—deciding the storm will pass—lacks a prior on-page moment when she genuinely believed it wouldn't, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.7)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or delivers a decisive tightening. Orientation is delayed—"shooting star tracking station" and Sola's role emerge gradually without early spatial anchoring (−0.4). The ending summarizes transformation ("cocoon for transformation," "legend") rather than landing a closure image with visible cost; no before/after is legible on the page, only asserted in retrospect. Causality is weak: the glass enables tracing, moss grows, visitors arrive, all without resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly, and the piece maintains single POV throughout. However, no decisive change occurs on the page: Elara begins守护ing words, continues守护ing words, and ends守护ing words with only declarative intent ("resolved to restore"). The ghost's dissolution is visual decoration, not a cost or reconfiguration—his spectral fingers brush glass and he fades, but Elara's options do not narrow. The covenant's "broken" state is told in exposition; no on-page beat dramatizes its breaking or repair with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The story attempts a hybrid lens—causal discovery of Harrison's message mixed with accumulative texture—but the lens wobbles: the middle section's garage-sale listings feel like outline steps rather than motivated beats, and the climactic meeting occurs through spatial hand-waving ("not walked, but simply was there"). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (learning to read time's texture, accepting borrowed time as gift), but the cost is conceptual only, never dramatized as a forfeited path or visible price. The urn fragment's return in the final paragraph gestures at charged reprise without reweighting prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit is legible. The poet walks to the lagoon, gathers debris, writes in a notebook, walks away, then sits on dunes—a circular tour without decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The kite string snap (paragraph 7) promises a turn but leads only to more meditation. Orientation is present early (cobalt lagoon, shoreline, after rain) so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but causality is absent: because/therefore linkage never tightens options. The piece reads as a 32-paragraph mood essay rather than a story with escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and pattern layering (copper wrapping, orchard response, final translation) that reweights Elias's death into legacy. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: his absence is present in the orchard's hum and the new caretaker's marginalia, reweighting "death sentence" into "bridge between kingdoms." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias discovers the marginalia about translation, narrowing his project from restoration to self-offering. The cost is visible—his body weakens, he works through fever—but the final disappearance without a body feels allegorically tidy rather than dramatically earned, softening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dusty footprints → chemical readings → amber resonance converge to reveal "the chemistry of homecoming." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist's understanding crystallizes and she commits to publishing—but the cost remains abstract: no relationship severed, no danger faced, no resource spent on the page. The escalation is a single deepening (chemical data confirms her hypothesis) rather than a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (coachman, coast road, post-reef world) within the opening lines and moves through a clear sequence: hearing the concord, scattering seeds, following the gull, planting, then watching the garden grow. However, the closure—"the battlefield is no longer a scar"—is told in summary across weeks rather than landing in a single on-page beat with felt cost. The causal lens is present (bird calls guide planting) but the final image lacks the immediate pressure or trade-off that would make the transformation undeniable in the moment. The coachman's agency at closure is diffuse; we're told he returns each twilight but see no specific renunciation or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Wick finds the vault and plays Maya's messages, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where his search ends with her voice filling silence—felt cost in accepting she won't return physically. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the journey gathers fragments (cylinder, leaf, riddle, scent memory) that cohere at the vault discovery. Orientation anchors quickly (settlement, Wick, retired). One meaningful deepening occurs when the monogram reveals Maya's identity, narrowing his goal and raising emotional stakes. The three-day trek compresses cleanly without losing causal thread.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens with the recurring compass rose and sketching ritual building toward the final drift. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation that pays off, triggering a −0.3 penalty. Closure offers Charged Poise (protagonist poised at threshold, drifting with supplies and compass), but the cost remains oblique: no visible forfeiture of a live option or tangible price paid on the page. The "new glimmer" functions more as abstract beacon than a dramatized complication that narrows tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric touches, but the piece does not teach a clear pattern by midpoint; the chessboard sequence and heart-mending feel like discrete exposition dumps rather than pressure points. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final constellation of images (sundial, spire beacon, Kaelen as guardian), but cost is asserted rather than legible: no path is visibly foreclosed, no trade-off shown. The Orientation Test is borderline: "icebound spire above the clouds" and "Kaelen, a chivalrous thief" anchor early, but the interior labyrinth and chessboard dais float without spatial or temporal grounding until the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered images and walking pattern rather than causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael commits to remain as historian, turning the gallery into a sanctuary. Cost is conceptual—he stays while the penumbra moves on—but the final paragraphs dilute this with repetitive thematic assertions ("quiet testament," "small gestures") that feel scaffolded rather than crystallized in a single charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (Mira), where (mountain bookstore), and when (after remembering becomes painful) within the opening lines. The closure—stone turning to dust, feather inscribed, labyrinth aligning—occurs on the page, and the "hidden thunder" reframes as a heartbeat rather than doom, constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causal linkage from feather-tracing to stone's transformation to labyrinth's realignment relies on declarative summary ("the revelation also brought...") rather than because/therefore pressure that narrows options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of symbols and pattern), but the final image reweights meaning conceptually without a felt, on-page cost that constrains future action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, village square, tapestry) arrive early. The causal spine—decode threads, find key, break stasis—holds, and the village's release is on-page. However, the closure lacks felt cost: the tutor lifts the key and time flows with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The girl's arrival offers a Charged Poise moment (teach again vs. refuse), but the choice is not dramatized; he simply accepts. The lens reads Causal, but the final image reconfigures theme more than options, suggesting Hybrid without clear dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive (canyon, towers, ritual night), and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through poetic acts and spectral imagery. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: the community shifts from sacrifice to speech, and the spire becomes a monument to refracted truth. However, the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page; "the ritual did not happen" tells outcome without showing a legible price paid by Kael or the Elders in that moment. The middle beats (poetry sessions, Mara's approach, pigment thrown) accumulate texture but lack a single decisive tightening that narrows options before the ending summary.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's procedure builds through repeated scarab-to-pockmark alignments, each releasing a memory fragment that she "quilts" into her consciousness. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, statue, failing life support) arrive early. The closure—Elara inhaling corrosive air as transformation rather than death, the statue warming with kintsugi gold—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her acceptance of brokenness-as-beauty crystallizes with felt cost (her lungs burning, the charm crumbling). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sea's own grief becomes part of her mosaic, reweighting the stake from personal repair to shared survival. Cost is visible in the charm's dissolution and her physical transformation, though the final image ("she or the sea became something entirely new") leans toward assertion over demonstrated consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (recurring motif of painted seashell, mirror crack, oasis), but closure lacks decisive cost: Elias completes the painting, leaves it in the cave, and walks away "with a lighter heart" in a soft emotional reset. The wrong-turn mechanism deposits him in the oasis without prior spatial setup or navigation pressure, reading as convenience rather than earned discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first lines, so no penalty there, but the ending offers conceptual repricing ("temporary eternity") without on-page felt price—he simply departs unburdened, and the seashell's abandonment registers as symbolic gesture rather than forfeiture with tactical or emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's months of observation, the cork's scent-memory, and the vibration motif build density that peaks when Marcus stops mid-shout and climbs the stairs. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marcus's hand-touch and whispered request crystallize a new stance with visible cost (his voice "cracked and raw from disuse"). Orientation is clear by the second sentence (assistant keeper, eleven months, cobalt lighthouse). One minor causal hiccup: the reader is told the vibrations "entered him...through his chest," but we don't witness Marcus's perception of the scent-memory in real time, only his reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, signal station, post-hydraulic failure) land early. The piece reads as accumulative/textural: each midnight call adds a layer, the resonator build intensifies, and the final activation reweights the dominant stake (recovering his sister's voice). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bridge opens, her voice returns, he achieves "fragile peace"). Cost is present but abstract—"fragile peace" and "gentle anchor" imply trade-off, yet no visible forfeiture or foreclosed option is dramatized on the page. The lens holds, but the cost remains more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through repeated storm imagery and the eye motif, but the closure wobbles between modes: the protagonist "learns to bind the eye with linen soaked in bitter sap" (a causal solution) while also claiming they now "balance the raw force of truth against trust" (thematic summary). The final paragraph's study of the glass eye as "a map of cracks" gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture crystallizes what was given up to reach this equilibrium. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The midpoint tightening (uncovering the eye at dawn, forcing truth onto villagers) does narrow options, but the resolution's cost is told rather than shown in a decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (nautical twilight, opal dock, Cornelius) and accumulates lyric detail toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Cornelius becomes "keeper and witness" with the stranger's memory settling into his own. Cost is implied (his ongoing isolation now charged by the memory) but the final paragraphs loop through multiple closural gestures (the sketch arrives, he smiles, the memory settles, the story "lives on") rather than landing one decisive image, diluting the closure's felt weight. The causal link between the boutonniere's fragmented memory and the letter's arrival the next morning is coincidence that complicates without resolving, acceptable under Situational allowances, but the proliferation of summary retrospectives in the final third ("From that day forward... would often pace... lived on") flattens present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a symbolic Conceptual Repricing at closure. The mosaic of ant trails, matrix engravings, and rising creek accumulates density, and the final image—Merrick disappearing, chip sinking—reweights the "doorway of decisions" premise with the cost of solitude abandoned. Orientation anchors appear early (shop, creek, midsummer). The tightening is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal; coincidence (phosphorescence, ant trail match) complicates but does not resolve through protagonist agency, which is permissible under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual and felt in the final image, meeting CR requirements, though the protagonist's agency in altering tactics is minimal—he follows rather than decides.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—queen becomes mountain sentinel—lands on the page with conceptual cost (loss of identity, throne, memories), satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration criteria. However, the causal chain from dream to climb to transformation relies heavily on vision-dump exposition rather than motivated choice; the queen's acceptance feels passive, driven by revelation rather than agency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of imagery reweights stakes), but mid-story the vision sequence introduces a Causal mechanic (invitation not warning) that doesn't fully cohere with the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece signals Accumulative/Textural intent through lyric repetition but never narrows options or delivers visible cost at closure. The "secret" remains abstract throughout; no specific information changes tactics or knowledge states on the page. The ending loops back to the opening's language ("density of presence," "return differently") without reweighting those terms through dramatized pressure—mere recurrence, not Resonant Reconfiguration. The Orientation Test passes by ~120 words, but the closure unit lacks the felt or conceptual cost required for RR or CR under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates lyric density and cadence shifts (grave → scroll → flight → return), and the final image ("chronicler sleeps, dreams soar, the scroll remembers") offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the chronicler accepts perpetual disintegration as the terrain. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain impressionistic past 120 words, though the pattern teaches disorientation as feature. Cost is felt (jealousy drains, certainty lost) but not concretely visible in a forfeited option or irreversible act. The closure reweights the premise but lacks sharp before/after pressure, reading more as thematic resolution than a decisive stance shift with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (fog, water clock mechanics, sensory substitution) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elena's shift from restoration to translation is crystallized in the final image of inhabiting time "one careful drop at a time" with felt cost (she cannot smell but accepts new languages). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. The tightening occurs when Marcus reframes the screw's function ("hold space, not control"), which reweights Elena's stance and enables the ending's reconfiguration, though the causal chain is more associative than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated saturated hush, crystallization imagery, and crow-quill invocations building toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the scholar becomes storyteller, rune crystallizes), but cost remains abstract—no concrete option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid on the page. Orientation anchors (floating rock, tea platform, Kaelin) arrive early enough. The piece teaches its lyric pattern and the final image reweights prior material, qualifying as RR under the accumulative lens, but the cost is felt rather than shown in a decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (Mira, archive beneath cider house, morning before tree-felling). The accumulative lens holds: scent release → memory unlocking → apology spoken → hand extended forms a legible tightening. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the handshake and shared exit into the waiting orchard crystallize a fragile reconnection with the cost of imperfection made undeniable in "not as a perfect resolution, but as an imperfect miracle." One slip: the induced-currents device arrives suddenly without prior setup, creating a minor convenience feel that slightly undercuts earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density of cosmic imagery meant to reweigh meaning—but the closure lacks visible cost; the witness achieves her aim (unification) without forfeiting anything on the page. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague through ~200 words, and "lost between tick and tock" teaches disorientation as decorative rather than functional. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; the effect does not charge closure. The spiral arbitration "concludes" but no before/after options are legible; the witness simply "becomes" without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but when remains vague (night/sunset/tomorrow blur without a legible timeline); apply −0.3. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural design with recurring "razor edges" and "counting backwards," but no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—Elias turns the key, has a realization, withdraws it, and walks away with no visible cost or altered stakes. The ending asserts closure ("his quest had come full circle") without an image that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a foreclosed path or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (library, Lila, lantern, father's recent death). The story accumulates clues across subway and library beats, converging on the hidden chamber discovery. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (promise to the father's ghost, lantern as beacon) with conceptual cost (carrying two worlds). However, the final chamber and card deck appear without prior setup, weakening causal grounding; the promise feels asserted rather than earned by on-page choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the loop pattern is taught early, accumulates through wrong-number calls, and breaks when Mira snaps the disc. Closure lands on-page (she walks out, phone silent, loop broken) with visible action, but cost remains asserted ("heart unburdened") rather than felt—no legible forfeiture or trade-off shadows the final image. Orientation is clean by line 2. The loop itself functions as a structural constraint, but the resolution (disc-snapping) arrives without prior escalation of what the disc costs her or enables, weakening causal pressure under even an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients quickly (archivist, archive, scroll discovery) and builds through layered images (locket, jetty, walnut ink, bouquet), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist's private ritual sparks communal healing. However, the closure unit lacks sharp cost: the "regenerated covenant" arrives through atmosphere and ritual rather than a legible choice that forecloses an option. The causality is soft—discovery leads to decision leads to offering—with motivated ellipsis but minimal on-page tightening. The villagers' response feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the final journal entry ("When context changes, the heart must choose whether to anchor or drift") reads as thematic summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by line 3, so no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ivy, moon rock, and "improbable rumor chain" recur—but the ending asserts a cycle ("the cycle beginning anew") without visible cost; Mira departs and the rock "glows softly," a declared promise rather than a felt reconfiguration. The rumor-chain mechanics are summarized ("Within hours…transformed") rather than shown through motivated linkage, breaking causal traceability even under an Accumulative lens. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing lands with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory layering and symbolic recurrence early (vibrating bark, ultrasonic frequencies, musical notes in lichen). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (Elara, forest, tonight, compass ring). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the stillpoint's melody "unfolded fully" and Elara recognizes her mother's unspoken grief), but the cost is largely asserted ("the weight of her mother's final silence") rather than shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The ring's "purpose fulfilled" moment gestures toward closure but remains abstract; no prior live option is demonstrably foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph, but the closure lacks on-page cost. Kael edits history with the pen, watches worry lines smooth, then sets it aside and returns to his console "content"—a soft reset without visible forfeiture or foreclosed option. The piece gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration ("even broken timelines could be mended") but the final image is declarative comfort rather than a charged crystallization of cost. The causal lens is taught through "contingent relationships" and editing beats, but the ending drifts into thematic summary ("the story never ends / It simply changes") rather than landing a decisive pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the harbor's silence accumulates through image and gesture until the advisor's reframing reweights it as "music" rather than "emptiness." Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias will remain at the harbor, now translating silence rather than rehearsing disappearance—and the cost is legible: he is still forgotten, still tethered, but the frame has shifted. One friction: the advisor's arrival and departure feel convenient rather than causally motivated, and the mechanics of how her signs "disrupt" his stasis are told more than shown. The ending image reweights prior material cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Kael traces ash → discovers archive → paints murals → finds vault. The orientation anchors early (volcanic foothills, archive entrance), and the final image (weeping portrait, Kael as eternal librarian) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is asserted in the final lines ("guarding knowledge with a tenderness that burned eternal") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or visible price. The Fibonacci cipher and dawn-angle calculation arrive as convenient solutions without prior dramatization of how Kael's choices shaped or risked the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) by the second paragraph and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds pressure through drumming beats and memory fragments converging at the lagoon. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into the garden system) with conceptual cost (loss of individual flesh, erasure by the facility). However, the AI drone and override protocols arrive as external complication without prior signal, weakening the sense that Kael's own choices narrow options. The final image—two syncopated heartbeats in the garden—lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. The story anchors orientation clearly (labyrinth keeper, Port Kessler, geomagnetic storm). The challenge from the smuggler provides a clear inciting incident, and the whisper's journey through the labyrinth follows motivated steps. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Marek wins the bet, keeps the corridor, and gains the coin as a trophy with no path foreclosed or stance altered. The final paragraphs summarize his reputation rather than landing a decisive on-page change or renunciation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (starlight, shutters, mirrors, water) without causal because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the child's smile and the guardian's continued vigil, but cost remains abstract—no legible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 5, satisfying the test. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, yet the final third recycles motifs (dock, stars, water, mirror) without a decisive reweighting that makes a before/after legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story unfolds as a sequence of symbolic tableaux—prophecy discovery, window displays, grotto gathering—without because/therefore linkage or motivated escalation. The "humble rebellion" is declared successful ("authorities...could only watch") without on-page resistance, complication, or cost; the displays simply appear and people gather with no dramatized friction. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("the most powerful revolutions are often the quietest") but lacks an on-page moment where Hartwin forecloses a path or pays a visible price; the mist "still curled" and change is "faint scent" rather than decisive shift. The drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal agency nor accumulative density lands a legible closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: scrimshaw summons whale → whale summons Mira → guardian encounter → unlocking → island retreat → return. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira embraces her dancer identity and chooses the liminal life. Cost is stated ("world, for a moment, sang with her") but the price—what she forfeits by leaving the docks—remains abstract; no on-page consequence or foreclosed path is dramatized in the final beats. The lens holds, but the cost-proof test is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and are stable. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the performer's nightly rituals accumulate texture, and the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing ("the remade hush was not a silence to be broken, but a canvas on which to carve the quiet art of survival"). However, the closure realization is asserted in explanatory summary rather than shown through a decisive image that reweights prior material with visible cost. The dog episode mid-story does not causally alter the performer's stance or tactics; it remains an illustrative vignette. Cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images of boundaries dissolving through sensory description and repeated metaphors. Orientation is established (atrium by frozen lake, after ban lifts) but causality is absent—the poet moves through space without motivated choices or reversals. The ending offers atmospheric closure (merging with shadows, colonnade humming on) but no legible cost or foreclosed path; the "ban lifted" frame is mentioned but never tested. The accumulative design requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the piece loops the same dissolving-boundary motif without deepening pressure or altering options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (phoenix/awakening motifs) but leans on weak causal linkage ("she hoped to barter," then "offered a trade") without dramatized negotiation or reversal. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and why she's in this courtyard emerges across ~250 words via exposition rather than action. Closure is a told transformation ("his chest stirred," "her heart hummed") with no visible cost or foreclosed path; the barter completes frictionlessly. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity (−0.4) apply, with no meaningful tightening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (laboratory, post-power-grid, Dr. Kaelen) and pursues an accumulative lens: the experiment deepens through setup, lens adjustment, prism-song refraction, and Mara's touch. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the laboratory becomes a cathedral, "the space between them, textured and golden and impossibly alive"—with conceptual cost legible in Kaelen's acknowledgment that her data will be "dismissed as corrupted data." However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; no on-page consequence visibly forecloses a tactical or relational path. The accumulative pattern holds, but the final image reweights meaning more through declaration than through a charged physical or relational shift.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: "timeless observatory beneath the world" is anchored by ~60 words, though "who" remains vague (mourning jewelry maker with no present physical grounding). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through metaphor and image—but causality is thin: the stencil "materializes," coordinates "pointed nowhere...yet tugged," and Elara "understood" without dramatized friction. The closure unit (Elara leaving a final crane, learning "rock bottom was foundation") is a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted metaphorically rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or realization that alters present options on the page. No on-page reversal narrows choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with Mara's mapping ritual building toward a final consultation that reweights the architect's understanding. Orientation anchors arrive early (rain, loft, cartomancer). The closure moment—"the future wasn't a chain, but a web"—functions as Conceptual Repricing, reconfiguring the architect's framework, though the cost remains oblique (his lost faith is narrated, not shown forfeiting a concrete path on the page). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spread reveals roots in negative space, shifting the reading from ruin to regrowth. The stated cost is conceptual rather than felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is and why she's here emerge slowly across the opening third without clear spatial grounding (crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, bronze pagoda—how do these relate?). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (memory purification through avoidance of pattern), but the closure is ambiguous: she withdraws from the pagoda "reluctantly," carries memories as a "bittersweet burden," and continues her work—no decisive change, and the reconfiguration lacks visible cost beyond vague emotional weight. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where a path is foreclosed or an option reweighted with undeniable price at the ending beat. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cost-legibility deduction −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern taught early via repeated dusk observations, silent video footage, shadow's progressive freedom; deepening through stone's increasing weight and shadow's metamorphosis). Orientation anchors arrive early (blooming library, cloud-world, her role). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the shadow transforms from threat to guardian, she forfeits the stone, and "luminous regret" crystallizes the cost—hope preserved but a piece of herself lost. The causal chain is mostly clean: stone catalyzes binding, footage comparison reveals the shadow's pattern, placement on screen triggers metamorphosis. One slip: the mechanism by which pressing a physical stone onto a monitor screen binds a shadow is asserted rather than prepared by prior world-rule anchoring, creating a small causality gap at the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (workshop, Elara, post-fraud timeline). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered actions (burning brochures, tending Veridian's tail, drafting the statement, calling the officer) that deepen Elara's stance crystallization. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she opens the door to the officer carrying "the shimmering stillness of the night's work," a reconfiguration of her relationship to honesty and dignity with the cost (public shame, legal consequences) made undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to request keeping the animals, narrowing her options and foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes "who" and "where" adequately, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between causal progression (tunnel discovery → glowing pebble) and accumulative/textural mood-building without committing to either by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the image of flowing hourglass sand and readable scars, but the cost remains abstract: no visible path is foreclosed, no tactical option narrows on the page. The tunnel journey functions as linear exploration rather than because/therefore causality or meaningful pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate toward a final density shift when Mira becomes the archive. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when are clear by ~250 words, but "crystal gazer" and "psychometry" remain opaque until the method is demonstrated, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she carries the love-storage map forward), but the cost is asserted ("soul migrated") rather than shown through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off. The incubation sequence loops conceptually without escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague: "beneath her window" and "the attic" never anchor a specific dwelling or locale, and "the edge of the world" is pure abstraction. The journey north is summarized in one sentence with no causal linkage or motivated ellipsis. Closure reads as assertion—"her creativity… now flowed"—without an on-page decisive change, visible cost, or reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible. The sextant's use is described but never constrains a choice or alters options; the falling star is a single passive observation, not a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the guard moves through a series of lyric beats (waking, traveling, discovering null-zone, planting archive, dissolving) that accumulate toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors emerge gradually—"dreamless freight guard," "glowing dune," "seven clicks south"—but "who" remains abstract past the 120-word mark, creating mild disorientation that the piece never fully teaches or pays off at closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the guard becomes "part of the charm," "the place where dreams went to be born"), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page; no prior tactic or relationship is visibly foreclosed. The chess clock's backward movement and the dune walking away supply imagery but lack causal grounding in the guard's prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are established early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never tightens or deepens—it laterally accumulates similar insights without meaningful escalation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she had become its architect"), but no visible cost is legible on the page; the transformation is asserted, not earned through prior causality. The "small gear" functions as a symbolic token rather than a constraint that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Lin is, why they came, and what the leash break costs remain vague past 120 words. The closure unit (finding the dog) lacks visible cost: Lin runs, reunites, and walks away enriched by a lesson delivered by others. The star-stamped ticket is introduced, marked, mentioned again, then dropped into sand without altering any choice. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ferry crossing and ridgeway traversal are transit, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt fortress, east wing, bellhop role) land within the first ~80 words. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elara's final sign-language report and acceptance of ongoing vigilance reconfigures her stance from exiled ghost to integrated watchkeeper, with visible cost (she will not rejoin the choir, privilege lost). The cost is felt in "she would remain, and she would watch" and the bolt she carries. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of the new rust stain forces the choice between silence and speech again, crystallizing the life-long price of vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, avoiding penalty. The causal chain—Sylvar inscribes riddles, Vael deciphers them, the rune sunders the glamour—is legible, but the closure lacks felt cost: Sylvar smiles, the throne awaits, and the library "remained." No path is visibly foreclosed, and the final image (rune fading, echo of truth) reconfigures little. The ending reads as accomplished mission rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rhythmic tapping, rising tide, and recurring atlas page accumulate toward the final rhythm-as-memorial. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the "path that did not disappear"), but the cost remains conceptual rather than legible on the page—Lina has already been tapping, already witnessing; nothing is foreclosed. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~120 words). The "delayed revelation" about the collapsed model is told in reflection, not dramatized as a beat that changes tactics or options, weakening causal linkage to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kai breaks silence by singing through the stone circle, awakening dormant systems and summoning possibility rather than victory. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory intensification (beacon pulse, hum, syncopated rhythm) until her voice becomes a tide. Cost is conceptual and felt: the lull ends, but the beacon will fade by morning, leaving only patient potential. Causality within the single scene is clean; the beacon-to-stone synchrony feels slightly convenient but the lens accommodates patterned coincidence that complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph; reconstruction context and sacred springs establish setting early. The drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative layering: kite discovery → decoding → unsealing → seed revelation. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (amber cracks, seed retrieved) and a Conceptual Repricing (destiny was metaphor, not divine embryo), but the cost remains abstract – Mara faces no on-page consequence from the elders, and the grandson's instant acceptance deflates the stakes. The final image of fire-resistant saplings is resonant, yet the story summarizes collective response ("Word spread...some called her traitor") rather than dramatizing immediate friction, weakening felt cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through repeated somatic contacts (cypress, eucalyptus, ferns) that reweight the photograph's meaning, culminating in the final metaphor (body as lighthouse tower). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's decision to return daily and his embodied reframing of the photograph constitute visible cost (he accepts the shadow will remain) and a new stance (survival through sensation, not erasure). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The two-shard structure (arboretum visit, then conservatory/eucalyptus sequence) coheres under one window with minimal transition. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes stillness preserves touch, not trauma. Cost is legible: he stops needing constant tactile comfort from the photograph, substituting embodied ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors POV and library setting early; the lighthouse's five-reality premise and thread discovery supply a conceptual frame. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's renewed ability to paint "necessary darkness" reweights her prior paralysis with felt cost (the ache remains). Lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural—density and symbolic cadence build toward a reconfigured stance. One meaningful deepening (touch threads → see lives → untangle → library exhales) narrows the artistic question. Cost is legible in the closing image, but the causality between untangling and the library's exhale is oblique; the mechanism reads more as metaphor than motivated physics.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph and establishes Kael's quest to understand temporal distortion. The drone's disappearance into the spilled ink provides a on-page event, and Kael's decision to pour more ink signals persistence. However, the closure is a declaration of intent ("Tomorrow, he would spill ink again") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the final image reiterates the question without reweighting options or foreclosing a path. The inferred lens (Causal/Situational hybrid) wobbles because the disappearance feels coincidental rather than motivated by prior action, and the ending does not crystallize a stance or narrow possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: discovery → choice → consequence, and closure lands on-page with Elara's recognition that "the conversation she provoked was louder than their boots." The dominant lens reads as causal with accumulative texture. However, the cost at closure is more asserted ("the most dangerous woman") than felt in a concrete forfeiture or visible narrowing of options. The story teaches its world and escalates pressure through the letter's release and the Council's collapse, but the final image of Elara smiling "bravely conflicted no longer" summarizes emotional resolution rather than dramatizing it with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (Lyra, glass dome, post-collapse desert). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritualized actions layered with symbolic objects (sandbag scrap, engraved disc, roses) building toward a thematic reconfiguration. The ending image—disc on altar, sandbag beside it, roses blooming as "silent vow"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page. No single beat narrows Lyra's options or changes her stance; the stranger's visit is a micro-episode that doesn't tighten the dominant stake (maintaining peace/continuity). The closure unit lacks the sharpness required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: wave-garden imagery and the rail-spike ritual build density toward a final reconfiguration when Avery withdraws the spike and Echo settles as a seed. Orientation anchors are present early (sound wave garden, Avery, constellations breaking patterns). The closure—releasing what was caught—lands with conceptual cost (some catches become offerings) and reweights the opening stake. One weakness: the mid-section loops through poetic restatements of "transliterate," "zigzag," "feral lullaby" without clear escalation of constraint or choice, creating a plateau before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Victoria's counter-memo and the scanned transmission constitute a Decisive Change that forecloses the orbit of regret with visible action. The Drive Lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: journalist's call → document review → proof-by-contradiction logic → counter-memo → transmission. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from studying discrepancies to writing the counter-memo, narrowing options from passive regret to active intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pattern of sonic/temporal motifs deepens toward closure. The story teaches its logic—time folds, lab appears during meteor hush, firmware grieves—and the final act (amber → phonograph → handwritten correction) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: constellations unravel, babies resolve to "ordinary sound"). Conceptual cost is legible (stars winking out, tethers unmade). However, the middle third loops thematic declarations without escalating pressure; the corrective mechanism arrives fully formed from the letters rather than emerging through Elara's struggle, reducing earned causality. Orientation is prompt (keeper, lab, guilt by paragraph three), so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who-where-when anchor arrives piecemeal across the opening third without clear grounding until well past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—completing the sand mandala with a violet interject at the seventh turn—lands on the page, but the cost reads as conceptual assertion ("she'd given the silence a vocabulary") rather than felt consequence; no visible price or foreclosed path appears in the final image. Causality is functional: tile flake whispers → artist draws → grotto responds, but the "unlearning" frame and villagers remain ornamental set-dressing that does not constrain tactics. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing attempt, but the ending reconfiguration is told rather than charged through image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test is not clearly met—who Arin is, what he can do, and what immediate stakes he faces remain vague past 120 words; we learn setting and mood but not a legible goal or opposition. The "renaming" appears as an announced intention midway through and is executed without resistance or reversal. The ending recycles the naming and thematic phrases without a decisive change or visible cost that reweights prior material; the plaza "holds its breath" and Arin's mission is "fulfilled" by summary rather than an on-page turn. No clear drive lens emerges: the text oscillates between mood-painting and retrospective claim without coherent causal or accumulative pressure to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a loose Accumulative/Textural lens (ghost drifts through spaces, memories accumulate, final image reweights the opening longing), and closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost's solitary encore becomes "a shared anthem." However, cost is not legible on the page—the ghost smiles, purpose fulfilled, without forfeiture or visible loss, and the actress's transformation is summarized rather than dramatized. Orientation is present but delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after the hedge-maze reveal (~15% in). The fractured-timeline mechanics are declared but never constrain a choice or narrow options; echoes are produced, colors swirl, and the result simply happens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers sensory and conceptual material around the geode resonance experiment. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the fractal-tree image, but no visible cost or option-narrowing occurs on the page—Lina ends with method, hope, and notebook intact, facing an implied future conversation without dramatized friction. Orientation is clean. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final image reweights prior material only abstractly; the "willowglass hope" brightening and the fractal tree feel decorative rather than pressured by a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established (coastal caves, post-hibernation). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory impressions and the fossil's "pulse" layer toward a final tableau. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost occurs; Lira simply waits for humanity's return, a static endpoint rather than a closure that reweights prior material. The heat-map data and the song do not narrow options or alter her stance in a way that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (the turner) and where (amber warehouse) within the opening lines, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: decades of button cataloging accumulate toward the prophecy's assembly on "the seventh day of the seventh month," and the final image—echo shared in amber walls—reweights the opening isolation into communal resonance. However, the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via the prophecy's question and her decision to cork the jar) lacks visible cost on the page; she completes her task and the echo "remains," but no tactic is altered, no path foreclosed, no price paid in the moment. The lens holds, but cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Kael at Zephyr Bluff, predawn, spring tilt) and pursues a single stake: vouchsafing Kael's return by trading buried codes for passage. The causal lens holds: the courier's arrival prompts Kael to excavate the codes, deliver the pillbox, and receive the forged passport—a decisive change with felt cost (the pillbox gone, Elena alive, second chance granted). One meaningful tightening occurs when the courier demands proof and Kael digs, narrowing options. The closure lands on the page with cost legible in the final image (empty hands, full heart). Minor deduction: the backstory (five years of exile, Elena's near-death) occupies ~25% of the text but remains anchored to present stimuli (the pillbox, the courier's words) and primes the closure choice, staying within the reflection-led allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the gutters' ticking, fog geometry, and palimpsest layering build density toward the final silence and needle contact. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the needles touching crystallizes thirty-seven years into a single point of contact with felt cost (the years themselves, the waiting). Orientation anchors early (coachman, tollhouse, fog-bound crossing). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman arrives and the promise's shadow becomes visible. Cost is legible in the final image: "leaving the palimpsest of their promise to be read by the next coachman" signals they've moved beyond measurement, a forfeiture of the vigil that defined Silas. Minor slip: the "distillation" motivation is told more than dramatized in tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (lantern glass, rosemary, thrum) and the closure reweights the premise with a charged conceptual repricing—kindness as architecture, the bowl left as both offering and messenger. Cost is legible in the "empty space in her pack" and the knowledge she carries forward. Orientation is clean. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kai recognizes the oasis is "phototropic to kindness," which reframes her investigation and leads directly to the final gesture. The structure holds, though the resolution leans heavily on thematic realization rather than a decisive physical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image (petal drop, bitting gauge, moonflower seeds, harbor moonlight) toward a final reconfiguration where planting becomes "horizontal hope" and Maya becomes "the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the bitting gauge shifts from loss-measurement to invitation-tool—but the cost remains oblique: the rose is gone, yet the emotional or opportunity price of abandoning the fire escape for the cannery lot is told more than felt. Orientation is prompt (Maya, fire escape, petal drop) and the piece coheres under its lens, but the final image asserts transformation without a visible sacrifice or friction point that makes the before/after undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture but lacks a coherent pattern or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear but the "reincarnation memory" timeframe and the library's mechanics remain vague past the setup. No on-page decisive change occurs; Mara's transformation from isolation to "independence" is narrated summary without visible forfeiture or a final image that reconfigures prior material. The ending offers thematic assertion ("she has become independent") rather than closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (Lira, lotus temple, post-storm). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the spiral installation and objects accumulate toward the final self-addressed letter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Lira moves from "locked chest" to "luminous thread"), but the cost—what path she forecloses—remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page. The turn from private keeper to public participant happens mostly in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure overlay. Orientation anchors clearly (booth, 2:47 AM discovery, campus split). The breakthrough → counter-frequency → transmission → effect sequence is motivated, but the core turn (recognizing tricksters manipulate via subsonic waves) lands via summary exposition rather than a dramatized beat that narrows options. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (arguments falter, signal fractures), yet the cost remains abstract—"wary dialogue" is asserted, not shown through a specific choice or forfeited path. The ending gestures toward Charged Poise ("tricksters would adapt"), but without a concrete on-page price or a visible option foreclosed, the resonance feels muted.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and her specific spatial position remain vague through the opening paragraphs, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The compass-point mechanism that "coax[es] hidden doors" and "pierced the stone" is asserted without prior setup or cost; the door opens on first attempt with no failure or adaptation. Closure lands (she retrieves the key, envisions new blueprints) but the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture, injury, or relationship price on the page. The causal lens wobbles: early beats suggest problem-solving (Causal), but the organ's "sonic tempest" revealing the door reads as coincidental aid (Situational), and the ending's thematic musing shifts toward Accumulative without a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation cleanly (quarry, Elara, studio sequence) and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of details (ribbon, portrait work, vendor alibi) accretes toward the arrest. Yet the decisive moment—the arrest based on Catherine's height correction—arrives via off-page inference rather than on-page pressure that reweights Elara's stance. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; the closure effect (return to quarry, ribbon ritual) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual and oblique, not felt or foregrounded in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (copper nail, coded stanzas, the camp emerging from ice) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the librarian's final stance crystallizes options and reweights the approved history with undeniable pressure, even though the personal cost is not yet fully paid on the page. Orientation anchors (map librarian, weather station, three weeks post-shift) appear early. The escalation hinges on decoding journals and overriding protocols, then the camp's physical emergence validates her choice—coincidence complicates (the melt reveals the camp) but does not resolve the protagonist's internal shift. Cost is legible in her defiance of termination and the director's retreat, though the social and professional fallout remains Charged Poise rather than paid fully on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes spatial anchors (pullout, grove, cairn) by ~120 words and avoids major orientation debt. However, the closure unit is weak: discovering a photograph that mirrors the hitchhiker does not create a Decisive Change, and the final music-playing moment functions as mood reprise rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. The causal chain is loose—scaffold wrap "spelling" a location via Morse code, then leading to a buried photograph, reads as coincidence serving atmosphere rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. Under a charitable Accumulative lens, the collodion shard and photograph echo across beats, but the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or felt cost; the fiddler's state at close is indistinguishable from the opening posture.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: symbols accumulate, Leo notices, the son steps from shadows, they exchange one conversation, Leo leaves with the bill. No reversal or tightening narrows options—Leo's shift from ambition to acceptance happens off-page between "flickering like a dying spotlight" and his whispered line. The Resonant Reconfiguration relies on Leo's unearned epiphany rather than visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Closure form is present but the cost remains asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with the variable star pulse and daylily symbolism building toward thematic resonance. The closure—Elara understanding the shared burden and archiving the telegram—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("weight," "promise") rather than dramatized through a tangible forfeiture or constraint. The causal chain from photometer readings to ancient-scribe vision to epiphany relies on convenient mysticism; the "her face was her own" moment resolves tension via revelation rather than earned pressure. Orientation is present early (observatory, desk, telegram), so no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. The closure effect—druid releases his own frozen confession, vortex calms—is legible with felt cost (guilt acknowledged, "warlike serenity" remains). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (druid, cursed lake, failed spell). Escalation moves from failed flame trick to expanding-circle chant to seed-planting, each narrowing options. However, the confession's revelation ("his own hand had once cast the curse") arrives without prior micro-cues that the druid suspected this truth, weakening the because/therefore chain at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who and where early (Elara in the cobalt glade) and establishes a hybrid lens blending accumulative/textural density with causal progression toward a visionary encounter. The maze-vision sequence offers a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara becomes "the crossing point herself," and the final image of planting the clipping suggests Charged Poise—options crystallized, a new path opened. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("root-bound no longer") rather than felt; no concrete forfeiture or visible trade-off lands on the page to make the before/after legible with price. The because/therefore chain from clipping → scar-touch → maze-vision holds, but the return to the glade and the dawn-bleeding horizon feel like a soft reset that clears the ordeal without lasting wound.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elara descends, barters memories for her sister's destiny, and the transaction completes with consequences. Orientation anchors early (catacomb orchard, Elara, the burned card). The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's memories are traded and her sister will wake "in a body not her own"—lands on the page, but the cost is told rather than shown in a concrete image or sentence ("lighter and heavier," "threadbare"). The midpoint turn (placing the card, memories pouring out) is functional but lacks a visible narrowing of options or a dramatized hesitation that would deepen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a dominant stake (purpose after public failure) and progresses from discovery to decision, but the closure reads as conceptual assertion rather than on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. The choice to keep the cloth and pin it above her desk occurs, yet the cost remains abstract—"quiet declaration" and metaphorical "encore" language replace a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The Accumulative lens is signaled through repetition of "echo" and valley imagery, but the final paragraph multiplies declarative statements about future meaning-making rather than landing a single charged image. The escalation is a tightening of resolve, not a narrowing of options or a trade-off that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through analogical layering, pattern inscription, and the seed's transformation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's ambition finds its proper shape and the city stabilizes. The closure—carving her name as witness and releasing the fruit—reweights her relationship to knowledge with conceptual cost (renouncing authorship, accepting incompleteness). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the spirit distributed itself into the field, which narrows her tactical options and drives the carving sequence. The cost is felt in the line "her ambition would haunt her no more," though the emotional price is somewhat muted by the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates density through the creel's journey from discovery to transmutation, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elara's refusal to fully smelt creates a new artifact category that preserves contradiction. Orientation anchors (titan-gear librarian, tidal atrium, post-tomorrow world) arrive cleanly in the opening. Cost is legible: she violates protocol, creates an unresolved artifact, and accepts perpetual migration rather than mechanical certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the creel on warming stones instead of in the feed-chute, reweighting her archival duty.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly: bunker inspector, Bunker 7, dormitory level. The piece follows a causal progression (discovery → caves → placement → broadcast effect) that tightens toward the pearl's activation. However, the closure effect—the caves singing and broadcasting hope—arrives as a magical consequence rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost; the "impossible" broadcasting through vents stretches causality without prior constraint. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost to Mara herself is not legible on the page. Lens: Causal with magical convenience at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (Mira, disused station, post-medication). The piece accumulates images (ivy, accordion, graffiti, map) toward a final departure, signaling an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the closure—walking away with a metaphorical understanding—lacks a legible cost on the page; the "promise" and emotional release are told rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible price. The map references "pulse" and guide her "toward a future," but no tactical choice or renunciation crystallizes in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: who is the dreamer, where is she before the forest, and what calendar anchor frames "the first fateful letter"? The closure unit—"releasing" the unspoken words—arrives without causal setup; we never see what stakes this foreclosed or what she gave up. The "cyclically reversed" cipher and propagation delays are mentioned but never constrain a choice or create a reversal. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout; no meaningful tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer) and teaches an accumulative/textural lens through layered imagery. However, the closure—planting the seed and denying the empire—lands with asserted rather than dramatized cost: the "mulberry ache" softens into "quiet certainty" without on-page friction or a visible price paid. The envoy's departure is narrated in summary ("told the envoy... the envoy left"), eliding the refusal beat that should carry weight. The final image reweights prior material but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, preventing full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Elara, grotto, aurora vigil) within the first two paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through ritual steps, sensory detail intensifies, and the final capture crystallizes prior pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the emerald now holds the poet's metaphor, fulfilling Elara's purpose—with conceptual cost (oblivion claims everything else). One micro turn (thread frays, droplet forms) suffices for this length. Causality is clean; no contradictions touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (who, where, when). The piece accumulates motifs (climbing, scallop pattern, grapes-as-memories) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes contentment lives "within the tending itself"—a reweighting of her twenty-seven-year search. Cost is felt but oblique: she stops seeking transcendence in the grapes and turns them into "simple jam," a renunciation. The epilogue's lyric reach (cloud-wanderer's letters, Aria's laughter) charges the final image, though the transition from vineyard climax to cottage feels like a soft reset that slightly loosens closure's grip.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—atmosphere and motif build toward the keeper's instruction—but closure lacks decisive on-page cost. The protagonist "lets the cloak slip…not to discard it, but to wear it more loosely" is declaration, not a felt forfeiture or resonant reconfiguration; no visible option is foreclosed. Motifs (campfire spark, hollow mirror, wind chimes) recur but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at the ending with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira's vanishing enacts her teaching, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture of a relationship, memory, or concrete stake is dramatized on the page. Orientation is delayed: who Mira is and what she risks only clarifies in retrospect, past the 120-word anchor window. The drive lens wavers between lyric-accumulative (ripple patterns, starlight motifs) and causal (backward aging premise), never fully committing to either, making it difficult to judge escalation or closure under a stable frame.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed but eventually anchored; the scene remains continuous in one location. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the skimmer comprehends temporal navigation while standing still, and the final image crystallizes her new role. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice or forfeiture accompanies the epiphany. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery and harmonic repetitions build toward the final reweighting, though the causal linkage between stone-skimming and comprehension remains loose.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Vorrin's refusal to unstrap the keystone forecloses his pension and integration, a visible cost that reconfigures his relationship to the Refactory's demand. The piece follows a causal-situational hybrid lens—mist-walk journey compresses via accumulative texture, but the spire arrival and keystone encounter operate causally. Orientation anchors (Vorrin, Refactory, mountain base, dawn mist) arrive within the first two sentences. One meaningful tightening occurs when he discovers no mechanical bindings and recognizes the Refactory's test, narrowing his choice to retrieval or preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece signals its accumulative/textural lens early through lush imagery and recurring motifs (lanterns, library, key tag), but the closure relies on Elias hearing "the color of silence: a clear, brilliant white" without a visible or felt cost that reweights his prior obsession. The shift from obsession to completion is told rather than dramatized; no option is foreclosed on the page, and the return to lamp-tending reads as a soft reset rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with pressure. Orientation is clear (pier, midnight, lamplighter), and the two-shard structure (pier → library → pier) is legible, but the accumulative density does not tighten meaningfully toward a final image that charges prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern through repetition (coins cast three times, static bursts intensify, backwards prophecy fragments attention) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara "became the new signal." Cost is felt conceptually—she dissolves into function—but the final image's pressure is diluted by the preceding summary-heavy paragraphs that tell transformation rather than dramatize a final precipitating choice. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: scattered light refracts fears into crystallized forms (blue ice, amber, quartz) in a density-building pattern. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the void becomes a mirror reflecting her own terror of becoming "the monster who collects monsters"—and reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (ancient observatory, dusk, wax cylinders) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final cylinder's incomplete phrase forces her to confront the un-nameable fear she carries. Minor drift: the trade "to save them from what they cannot name, you must surrender what you cannot keep" is remembered rather than dramatized, softening causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael measures drips, adjusts the bell, strikes it, and the cosmos shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bell's song restores fish and balance), but the cost remains abstract—"lukewarm magic spent" is told, not shown through forfeited options or visible trade-off. Orientation anchors (sapphire viaduct, dawn, Kael) arrive early. The ritual sequence coheres, yet the final image ("bell's echo still humming in his bones") reconfigures atmosphere more than stakes; no concrete price or foreclosed path is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Nora gathers fragments (label, photographs, memory) toward a final writing act that reweights the town's history. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit—writing the truth and stepping back into the night with resolve—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she commits to a path), but the cost is asserted ("weight of the past lift") rather than shown in a forfeited option or tactile price. The tightening from discovery to documentation is present but gentle, without a sharp turn that narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbols (crystal, flame, starlings, violets) toward a thematic repricing. Orientation is present early (alchemist, orchard, waterfall, forty-eight-hour deadline). However, the closure unit—"to harmonize logic and intuition was not to merge them, but to let them dance"—arrives as a told epiphany rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. The crystal shatters and she sleeps; no visible price is paid, no option is foreclosed. The escalation is textural (motif accumulation) but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt consequence, only thematic assertion. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (anchors are clear), but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: the tether failure creates pressure, the protagonist revises the sequence, the system accepts, tension resolves. Orientation anchors (midnight arbor, city below, tether) arrive early. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (manual override secures the tether), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"the weight...lift[s] slightly" tells outcome without showing a forfeited option or felt price in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs (emergency protocol revision under time pressure), meeting the length requirement, but the stakes remain abstract; no specific loss or tactical alteration is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sensei integrates clones and jarred brain, foreclosing transcendence-without-cost and opening a path where enlightenment includes emotion. The drive lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid—temporal storm and clone appearance force the vivify choice, which then alters his existence. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, timeline fracture, clones) arrive early. One modest deduction: the clones' backstories "rewriting mid-sentence" is mentioned but not dramatized in a way that narrows his options before the peak choice; the temporal threat remains atmospheric rather than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered attempts (yanking cord → off-key wind → lullabies → macerated silence → Sarah's laugh → brotherly call) until Eleanor's form thins, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: her work complete, she releases). Cost is visible: "the proper weight of her own absence" and her dissolution. One meaningful deepening—Sarah's first cracked laugh breaking three months of silence—narrows the emotional stakes and changes the household's trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals "wait" early and accumulates through patterned images (mist, ice, pendant) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the guardian interiorizes the garden and accepts waiting as "a way of arranging the world." However, orientation anchors (who/where/when) emerge slowly and remain vague past the 120-word mark; the frozen garden and "between dimensions" setup lack spatial grounding until deep into the text. The closure effect lands (Earned Stasis: waiting becomes home with conceptual cost of never leaving), but cost feels implied rather than viscerally on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovering the pendant reweights the guardian's stance), satisfying length requirements, yet causality often reads as synonymous restatement rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered attempts, the density of alchemical imagery, and the recurring motif of the crozier and embers. Orientation anchors (Elara, ember nexus, twilight, Cathedral of Stilben) appear early. The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara achieves success by vivifying failure itself, creating "frozen bloom" with undeniable conceptual cost (eternal stasis, neither death nor life). The escalation moves from three generations of failure through her Thirty-Third Transmutation to the final glass tree, with visible cost: she destroys the crozier and her certainty, walking away from the result.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira strips down her equipment, touches the shard, receives the insight, and rewires the tower. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—transformation from interpreter to listener—lands with conceptual weight, but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally legible. The causal chain from "discard assumptions" to "pattern emerges" compresses insight into a single beat without intermediate friction, weakening the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece orients who (Lina), where (ferry Tidemark), and when (tonight, seventh tide) promptly. The closure unit—timelines snapping together after Lina's radio pulse—lands on the page, but the cost reads conceptual rather than felt: "permanence settling on her shoulders, yet she knew it was fleeting" tells us impermanence persists without showing what Lina forfeited or what tactical option closed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building via spectral grotto, starlight, hourglass glow), yet the final reweighting is muted by the immediate acknowledgment that "the merge was temporary" and the cycle will repeat, undercutting any decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a dominant stake (discovering connection's texture) and executes one meaningful deepening when the false memory erupts and water floods upward, altering Mira's understanding. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—Mira's realization that connection is "the precise weight of a gaze"—arrives through telling rather than a decisive on-page choice or renunciation, and the conceptual cost (letting go of control) is implied rather than dramatized with a specific forfeiture or altered tactic in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric accumulation via philosophical imagery—and the final image (Corin's bioluminescence forming Ursa Major) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the dominant stake. However, cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no on-page moment crystallizes what Mara forfeits or risks to achieve this teaching breakthrough. The Tethian elder's appearance and Corin's question function as late markers rather than causal turns, and the closure image, while resonant, does not make a felt price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens early (tracking voices in liminal space) but pivots mid-story to a causal rescue without sufficient groundwork—the hearing aid tracking a living heartbeat contradicts its established ghost-seeking function. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening lines. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (continuing the cycle), but the cost remains abstract ("ready to follow the thread again") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or stance shift. The reveal that the pulse belonged to the living man, not Lila, creates a reversal, but it arrives via coincidence rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marek stands witness for seven seconds, fulfilling the mission with conceptual cost—the names remain erased, yet the human price is acknowledged—then retreats as the tide forces withdrawal. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through phase-transition language and cable-relay imagery, culminating in the charged codex-closing beat. Orientation anchors (submersible, facility, Marek, tidal window) land within the opening ~100 words. One tightening: water rising forces the exit, narrowing options and charging the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts the ghost's wisdom and resolves to carry the shard forward—but the cost is asserted ("as she had mended the ghost") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. The defragmentation sequence provides one meaningful deepening, yet the final image ("ready to write a new chapter") abstracts the stakes rather than charging them with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (nested images, mythic diction) and sustains it. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond continues singing "a voice without need of ears," reweighting the storyteller's failure into persistence beyond meaning. Cost is conceptual and legible—the language dies completely, she exhausts herself, yet the translation endures. Orientation anchors appear late (~15% for "canyon of endless echoes," ~20% for bone tower context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spinebirds' geometry is mapped onto the diamond's curse, tightening the translation attempt. The lens holds, but the late anchoring and the summary-heavy final third (years passing, travelers reporting, her death recounted) dilute immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: who Lyn is beyond "cryptid researcher," where precisely the garden is, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words. The closure—Lyn's metamorphosis and emergence—is told via summary ("felt her bitterness dissolve into stardust") rather than shown as a decisive change with dramatized cost. The piece oscillates between undercover procedural, love-loss grief, and cosmic transformation without teaching a stable lens; by the end, the dominant drive is unclear. The epilogue ("days that followed") diffuses rather than crystallizes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through orchard imagery, locust shell, and heart-rhythm recursion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraphs. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara becomes a bridge, the statues awaken, and tomorrow they will signal beyond the orchard. However, the cost at closure is declared ("chest aching with new rhythm") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or visible price—she gains agency and community without dramatized loss. The causality of the locust shell's arrival ("a breeze that shouldn't exist") and its microscopic filigree feel convenient rather than seeded. One meaningful tightening occurs (the counter-pulse from the clocktower), but escalation stalls when she simply "lets her heart fall" and succeeds without a legible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm-bottle's message constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the broken promise "finally kept"), but the cost remains largely told ("the weight of the promise he had finally delivered") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or behavioral shift. The causal chain—mailman carries bottle, drone flies, mother receives message—is straightforward but the closure unit lacks a legible on-page price that would elevate the reconfiguration beyond sentiment. Orientation Test penalty waived; lens holds but cost proof is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a final Resonant Reconfiguration (the carousel spinning, train breathing). Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The closure effect—carousel restored, train reanimated—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt; we see no visible price Silas pays (no fatigue, sacrifice, or foreclosed path). The "wrong turn" discovery reads as convenient coincidence that enables rather than complicates. The Cost Proof Test is not satisfied: no specific sentence shows Silas losing, renouncing, or trading anything at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: by line ~15 we know "librarian" and "library," but the who/where/when anchor drifts in ornamental detail (scarf knots, astrophysical sonnets) without situating the present goal until much later. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and image), but the closure—opening the zeroth volume and experiencing "raw déjà vu"—offers no legible cost or stance shift; the librarian reappears "pristine" with no path foreclosed. The reawakening completes without friction, and the final image ("stories never truly end—they only fold and refold") is abstract moralizing rather than a charged particular. Causality is loose: the scarf-as-map and hyperbolic-geometry method are introduced late and resolve the quest without prior obstacle or tradeoff, reading as convenient fulfillment rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (librarian, floating library, dawn) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake (capture vs. release). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the empty well becomes "trophy of luminous loss"—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. However, the cost is asserted more than dramatized; the cipher's lesson ("what is captured must also be released") arrives as revelation rather than through prior causal pressure, weakening the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a stable accumulative/textural lens through the ritual framing and charged imagery. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Merrin's longing crystallizes in the final image of wrapping her own hair around her finger, reweighting her role from liberator to one still imprisoned. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs, and the "freed idea" for the woman is told rather than dramatized, weakening the closure's emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric accents; the progression from returning → measuring → cultivating → placing completes a motivated chain that unlocks memories. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias gains his memories but renounces further pursuit, with the cost legible in "some fairy rings should never be disturbed." Orientation anchors (Elias, lagoon, forty years later) arrive early. The tightening from discovery (shipwrecks mirror Pleiades) to solution (complete the constellation) to consequence (memories flood back) follows clean because/therefore logic, though the middle stretch relies heavily on exposition rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the archivist chooses to remain in exile to mentor Lin, forecloses her return, and that refusal carries felt relational cost. The progression from isolation to shared purpose reweights the opening's "forgotten library" with communal breath by the end. One tightening occurs when the shard "glows faintly" and the annotation succeeds, narrowing the exile question to a conscious choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 100 words cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear dominant stake (preserve wonder) and delivers an on-page closure—the seed cracks, the tree grows, wonder returns—but the causal linkage is thin: Vespera sings, weaves water-threads, and the seed simply opens on schedule without a decision or reversal that narrows options. The "radiant hush" timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint that forces tactical choices. Orientation is prompt but vague: "verdant parapet" and "border-orchards that grew not in one world, but many" gesture at setting without grounding who, where, when in a legible frame by ~120 words (−0.3). The Accumulative lens is implied by the lyric mode, but the closure image does not reweight prior material with visible cost—wonder simply multiplies without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara, mask restorer) and where (prism sanctuary) early; "tonight" establishes when. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as each knot releases a memory, culminating in the pearl as compressed silence with conceptual cost. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spirits become "architecture" in her bones, the net hung as forgiveness)—the final image reweights prior material and forecloses the path of carrying alone. The cost is felt but abstract; pointing to "redistributing—seven souls finding their names again in her breath" as the on-page cost moment. No causal breaks, one meaningful deepening across the unraveling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elena framing the restored map with a silver thread marking the tear—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) that reweights "unknown becomes known through listening," but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint appears on the page. The accumulative design (studio → archival whispers → site → silent footage comparison → chapel entry → framing) teaches its pattern and coheres, yet the final image feels more like thematic summary than a charged reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Cassian, sunken library, post-Earhart discovery). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered observations and the snow globe's symbolic density until the final slate inscription and ascent reweight grief as "buoyancy." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the globe shifts from prison to carried artifact), with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "some threads are meant to be held, gently, in glass." One friction: the turn from measuring to understanding occurs more through assertion ("understood then") than a dramatized beat that forces the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece gestures toward accumulative/textural mode with recurring glyphs and mist, but pressure never tightens or deepens—each paragraph restates the encoding action without narrowing options or raising cost. The "closure" dissolves into light and mist with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the ghost drifts upward as atmospheric assertion rather than earned transformation. No visible or felt cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the elevator climbs and diary entries deepen, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (affectionate detachment settling with visible emotional cost). Orientation anchors early (frozen spire, glass elevator, servant ascending). The optical-encryption conceit is elegant and causally motivated by the goggles and ice-refracted light. The reversal at floor nine—where the captain's hidden joy is revealed—reweights prior anguish with clear emotional stakes, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("stories unfold not through force, but through attention") weakens the earned image by stating what the goggles-on-desk gesture already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (gondola, broken cable, dusk, meteorologist). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric memory as metaphor accretes through spooled data, cloud names, and Thorne's buried truth, culminating in Mara sealing the canister as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she accepts the sky will hold what journals won't, forecloses public proof, visible cost on the page). One meaningful deepening occurs when the "acceptance" cloud envelops the gondola and she speaks Thorne's truth into the recorder, reweighting her seventeen-year obsession. The Cost Proof Test: "She tethered the canister of spools to her emergency chute, its weight reassuring"—the physical act of preserving proof for the air itself rather than science journals is the felt cost. Lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a Hybrid lens (causal setup + accumulative lyric closure). Orientation anchors appear early (library, Kael, demolition clock). However, causality flattens in the second half: the coin-to-wall transfer and the sky-mirroring unfold without resistance, and the demolition arrives as scheduled backdrop rather than a pressure that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing ("the sky, now free, expanded beyond any wall"), but the cost is asserted in metaphor rather than demonstrated through a forfeited path or visible loss. The final walking-away beat lacks the felt price required for RR or CR to land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (airship chart room, Elara, evening starlings) arrive promptly. Drive lens reads Causal: phrasebook clue → hopscotch pattern → coordinates → journey → discovery. The closure lands on-page (Elara realizes predecessor left breadcrumb, crew legends her name), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option in the final image. The inferred lens holds, yet the ending summarizes consequence ("became a legend") instead of showing a choice or reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story unfolds as a series of static tableaux rather than causal linkage: she finds prophecy fragments, uncaps a gear, follows mist, inserts gear, retrieves second gear, restores the hall. No decision narrows options or incurs visible cost; each step is a frictionless discovery that enables the next without opposition. The ending offers metaphorical restoration ("time could be mended") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, or Conceptual Repricing—she completes a ritual and departs unchanged. Orientation is delayed: "who" and "what she wants" emerge gradually across the first third without deliberate disorientation that later pays off, applying −0.4 under the Orientation Test and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (orchard planet, floating arches, community) appear early, but the ghost's agency and the water-crisis stake remain abstract until the bell appears past midpoint. The closure—ghost fading into nebula after fulfilling purpose—lacks visible cost; his disappearance feels like atmospheric exit rather than foreclosing a live option. The dominant lens is unclear: causal turns are weak (bell rings → water flows with no friction), accumulative texture doesn't deepen pressure, and situational crystallization is absent. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern but the connective pressure across beats remains diffuse, and the spiral chalk mark at the end is thematic assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation anchors arrive slowly: "doomsday clock adjuster," "hidden lighthouse," "dusk" establish who/where/when by ~50 words, acceptable. However, the piece offers no legible closure under any lens. Causal: no because/therefore linkage tightens options—she arrives, performs her task, succeeds without obstacle. Accumulative: density does not increase or break pattern; the prose remains uniform throughout. Situational: no stance crystallization under pressure; she enacts her plan unopposed. The puppet head dissolves, the clock stops, she smiles—no decisive change, no cost, no path foreclosed. Closure form is absent; applying Q2 baseline penalty for missing on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and maintains clear spatial choreography through the labyrinth. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the repeated nut placements create a pattern of shadows that narrow the travelers' path, culminating in "the final nut...its grooves worn smooth by handling and hope." Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elara retreats into the orchard, the travelers saved but unknowing, the cycle intact—with felt cost (loneliness, separation). One meaningful deepening occurs when frost begins forming and her reluctance battles urgency, raising stakes within the time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—grief unpacks through layered images (ravine, foam, chrysalis, polymer synthesis). Orientation is clear early (ravine, Elena, chrysalis). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (loosened grief, new polymer formula), but the cost remains abstract: the sister's absence is reframed as "connection" without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. The foam-to-polymer insight and lab success feel convenient rather than earned by prior dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within bounds (vendor in floating library on opening day) but the drive lens remains ambiguous—lyric/accumulative patterns are taught but no single stake tightens or deepens with visible cost on the page. The woman's transformation ("she found it: the unmarked place") is asserted rather than shown as a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence. The final image (vendor among bottles, woman beginning to write) offers atmosphere but no legible before/after cost or option foreclosure. Closure effect is conceptually claimed but not dramatized, violating the on-page closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (chef), where (desert fortress, coral pavilion), and when (morning after rain) by the opening paragraphs. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the chef's descent, pool analysis, and progressive subsuming of the woman's remorse, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the chef accepts vessel-status with visible cost ("brittleness spreading, hairline fractures"). The closure lands on the page with felt cost in the final image of kneading dough haunted by "the ghost of a daughter's hand." One minor causality slip: the woman's "newfound lightness" passes back into the chef via touch, which reverses the established contagion direction without clear motivation; this reads as convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, her role, and the town's geography emerge piecemeal across the first third without spatial anchors (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (phrases gathered, sung together), but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara convenes the talk, teaches the melody, the town sings, the clock works. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in theory (bridges built, elevators hum), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no character refuses participation, no language is lost, no prior silence pays a price on the page. The final image ("bridges spanned the silos, built of melody and starlight") restates the premise without reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost. The engineer performs her memory-modification work, then sleeps—no decision forecloses a path, no visible price is paid, no options narrow. The ending offers only declarative summary ("having learned that to excavate the past is to modify the present's synaptic foundation") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed: who she is and what she's attempting emerge gradually through abstract language rather than grounded anchors by ~120 words. The drive lens remains ambiguous—neither clear causal turns nor accumulative pattern-teaching govern the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The lens reads Causal-Adventure with a linear fetch-quest structure: find grotto, record glyphs, escape before window closes. Closure is a successful extraction with the tablet secured, but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost—she simply wins and returns, mission accomplished. The Cost Proof Test fails: the ending describes readiness and vigilance as future states rather than a visible present sacrifice or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (grove, sculptor, morning) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the sculptor discovers the sculpture, deciphers its cracks, strums it, and the grove "becomes a resonant chamber." However, the closure lacks a visible cost or decisive change—she "continues her work" and "the world listens" without forfeiting a live option or facing a consequence. The final image ("the silence not empty; it is full of music") offers Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page. One meaningful deepening (strumming awakens the hum) tightens pressure, but the ending's cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric patterning (magnetic pulses correlate to memory, chess imagery recurs). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael releases the stone, transforming the covenant into "something more difficult, and therefore more beautiful." Cost is conceptual—he walks away, erasing his footprints—but the final image reweights prior material. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (twilight nexus, Kael arriving). However, the middle third loops memory and metaphor without a distinct tightening; the decision to release the stone arrives without a prior reversal or deepening that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers silences and frequency imagery toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Mira, workshop, stars, pre-fireworks stillness) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira unlocks the diary, reads her father's insight, invites the neighbor, and the final image reweights "silence" from catalogued varieties to shared empathy. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt: no on-page choice forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. The lock opens via frequency-tuning without friction, and the neighbor's inclusion feels ambient rather than a turn that narrows Mira's path. The reconfiguration lands but lacks undeniable pressure at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (seed, scent, doodling, journal) and modulates tone through repetition. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the seed's teaching reweights the premise—but the cost remains asserted ("a memory... rested in the soil of his heart") rather than dramatically legible on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tincture is brewed and tested, but the minstrel's arrival and the elders' testimonies feel like additive validation rather than a turn that narrows options. The final paragraph loops thematic claims without a fresh image that charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael launches, navigates through arches, encounters the seed cyclone, touches the key seed, and returns with new understanding. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael will plant the seed and teach workers to embrace die-off as part of resilience—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The final image of planting tomorrow and teaching backward growth is resonant, yet the price Kael pays (risk taken, old methods abandoned) is implied rather than dramatized in a visible forfeiture or renunciation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words and maintains causal sequencing (arrival → measurement → hypothesis → vantage → departure). However, closure is declarative rather than dramatized: "She would publish her findings" tells future action instead of showing a present decisive change or charged reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final paragraph shifts into thematic summary ("the world was a web of converging forces") rather than letting the image land with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when she quickens her pace, but the ending deflates into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening. The closure unit—wonder "unfettered" and spreading—is asserted rather than earned by visible cost; Lyra lowers the bells and visitors later describe effects, but no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path materializes. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (bell sequence building toward release), yet the final third summarizes aftermath in exposition rather than crystallizing pressure in a charged image. Under the inferred lens, a meaningful tightening occurs (the hush fractures) but cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: driftwood markers, flute playing, and the canyon hush recur to build density. However, the closure lacks a clear decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost—the keeper "resolves to return" and "carries the flute as a bridge," but no on-page action or image forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence. The ending summarizes insight ("failure…was not a wall but a door") rather than dramatizing a crystallized choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, so no penalty applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece presents a series of thematic gestures rather than a coherent causal chain. Cassian feeds the halo fragment into the press, hands pages to clients, records data—but these moves do not narrow options or impose cost; they simply accumulate atmosphere. The ending offers a cosmic mood ("the world was a matrix of light and shadow") but no on-page decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization with felt consequence. The "open problem" frame explicitly defers closure, leaving the reader with an unresolved thesis statement rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the courier's routine delivery acquires wonder through the pendant-child encounter, and the final image of his continued walking attempts Charged Poise. However, the closure lacks felt cost—handing away the pendant should foreclose his mentor's legacy or his own capacity to coax wonder, yet he retains "the pendant's echo in his chest" and walks "forever coaxing wonder," neutralizing the sacrifice. The resonance is asserted in the coda rather than earned through on-page constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (frost, prism, quartz) toward a final reconfiguration where Seraphine becomes "instrument" rather than discoverer. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—"the discovery had made itself known through her"—that reweights her agency with felt cost (empty hands, transformed motivation). One minor causality slip: the condensation words "She was already gone before the impact" appear without clear mechanism, reading as convenient rather than earned by prior prism mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (Mei, orchard, loom, thirty-year quest). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (silence, weaving, puzzle, bead) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mei completes the pattern and releases the message. However, the closure unit depends on convenient coincidence—the puzzle box at the rummage sale contains her own younger face and enables the solution it did not help create. The final paragraph's summary ("Lin woke with a sudden warmth") tells rather than shows the message's arrival, diluting the on-page cost. One meaningful deepening occurs (placing the bead in the shuttle and beginning to weave memories), but the mechanics of how the message actually crosses the distance remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: cracking arches → Ren's research → mine descent → barter → restoration. The closure lands with visible cost (the copper rings dissolve) and the arches seal, fulfilling a Decisive Change under a causal lens. The four-day mine descent compresses time but maintains forward pressure. Minor orientation slip: the "planet's quiet edge" and council location remain spatially vague in early beats, though this does not obscure the dominant stake or finale.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lira is and where she stands remains vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—Lira's acceptance of the guardian role—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is thin: the shard's "cyclically spontaneous" pulse guides her hands without obstacle, and the rift disperses across parallel universes via a process that feels externally narrated rather than protagonist-driven. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image ("a compass") is stated rather than charged by prior particulars, and no visible cost forecloses a path. The piece violates the Cost proof test: no exact sentence shows what Lira sacrifices or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (recurring images, pattern of cairn stones, glass-bottle motif). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Caleb reweights the lighthouse promise by bottling safety, relit lamp confirms the vow. Cost is conceptual (the promise preserved) but not deeply felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs (lamp fails → Caleb acts → lamp relit), but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than choice-driven under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and when/where this occurs drifts until "emerald lighthouse" anchors setting but "After the last print newspaper folded" remains vague atmosphere rather than felt stake or temporal anchor (−0.4 Orientation Test; cap Q3 at 7.0). The drive lens reads as attempted-Accumulative (lyric patterning, motif recurrence) but closure is declaration rather than a resonant reconfiguration with cost: "the storm herald's laughter was not a warning, but a promise of dawn" summarizes theme instead of dramatizing a decisive change. The ship's safe harbor arrival is coincidence—she shouts, the storm abates, he turns the wheel—without visible price or foreclosed path. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what she loses or what path closes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive cleanly in the opening beat. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the master grinds wings, seeks meaning in sun trails, receives the stranger's revelation, and settles into a new role marked by deepening pattern (visitors, child's first words, rising tea house). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the master becomes "vessel and lens"), but the cost remains conceptual and untethered to a specific forfeiture on the page. The stranger's vanishing and the flood of donor memories function as externally granted insight rather than protagonist-driven escalation, weakening causal linkage even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/lyric with symbolic objects gathering toward a thematic reweighting, but the closure unit—Elara's realization that the labyrinth transforms sorrow into hope—lands as stated theme rather than felt reconfiguration with visible cost. The pin's echo in the final paragraph gestures toward resonance but the cost of her new understanding remains abstract. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty. Causality is present but soft: the sextant heals because legend says so, the door opens because she "deconstructs" threads of light, without friction or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (silver leaves, mica, woven dawns, singing) toward a final density shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn returns, realm rekindled—but cost is asserted in summary ("his own memory would scatter again") rather than shown in a concrete image or action that makes the loss undeniable on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; no penalty applied. The second half largely restates the first without meaningful deepening, weakening closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative philosophical texture building toward a conceptual repricing) and orientation anchors are present early (Mira, bookstore, near midnight). The closure—Mira stepping through the door and understanding she "belonged here all along by choosing not to belong"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration where her isolation is reframed as connection, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically legible. The story relies on nested philosophical revelations in quick succession (lines 9-10, 17-19, 23-25) without clear causal linkage between them; each insight feels like a separate epiphany rather than a because/therefore chain. The corridor of light and other members holding invitations materializes without prior setup, weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara's repeated acts of guerrilla gardening build density until the breadcrumb ritual crystallizes as a communal act of witness. Orientation is clean (Mara, abandoned palace courtyard, post-bakery-closure winter) within the first paragraph. The closure—scattering breadcrumbs as benediction and the epilogue flash-forward—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the final image reweights the dominant stake (resisting erasure through attention) with conceptual cost (the palace remains abandoned, the bakery vanished). However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page: we are told the participants find absolution and witness, but no prior live option is foreclosed by this choice, weakening the felt pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: who this chief is, where exactly "above clouds" places him, and what the frozen library's jeopardy concretely entails remain unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 = 7.0 cap. The piece cycles through synonym-heavy description rather than causally linked beats; the chief adjusts the lantern, measures frequencies, and projects the vow in a sequence that reads as outline rather than because/therefore pressure. Closure claims the library is saved and the vow rekindled, but no decisive cost is legible on the page—the final paragraphs loop the same ideas without a felt before/after change. The drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal throughout, never cohering.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the protagonist chooses to preserve the truce by capturing evidence rather than direct intervention, foreclosing confrontation and carrying the fragile sound alone. The causal chain is legible—two failed attempts teach her to target the betrayer's own words—and the orientation anchors (rotting pier, pirate market beneath, midnight arrival) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric texture; because/therefore linkage holds. One minor slip: the hidden compartment and recording device feel conveniently positioned, though the watch-fob mechanism partially earns the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (lavender bluff, forests holding elections, Elara's luminescence) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory data accumulates through taste, converging phenomena deepen the pattern, and the final image reweights Elara's quest. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of the unsolvable, handing over the ring) with conceptual cost visible in "she would report nothing." However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized—what exactly does Elara lose by not reporting? The ending gestures toward future nostalgia but the immediate consequence remains oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs when the three phenomena converge, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers as Causal with lyric undertow: Elena's lock-solving enables the charcoal discovery, which triggers her return to drawing. Orientation anchors (cave, Elena, post-laughter timeframe) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—Elena sketching crystal walls and resolving to keep the broken lock—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts art's return with visible cost of facing the blank page). Cost is legible in "auroral sorrow" and "quiet echo" but remains asserted more than felt in a specific forfeiture. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; no causality breaks occur. Mid-range placement reflects that the tightening (lock opens → charcoal found → drawing resumes) functions cleanly but the escalation is thin—one problem, one solution—and the final image reweights prior material moderately rather than decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse city, toxic sky, calligrapher). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through archive discovery and tape listening—but closure lacks visible cost: she leaves "with the reel...and a heart full of light" and transcribes "each truthful word" without forfeiture or obstacle. The candor-as-gold-leaf motif recurs but does not narrow options or reshape stakes at the end. No meaningful tightening occurs; the arc is additive (search → find → transcribe) without pressure or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and why she climbs emerge gradually through the first 25% without clear spatial anchors. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—building density through image and motif—but lacks a single on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The child's arrival functions as witness to an already-complete sculpture rather than a decision point. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (wonder preserved through kinetic art outlasting speech), and the cost is legible in the tuner's self-erasure, but the transformation occurs off-page across seasons rather than in this scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The magnetic shift functions as both literal constraint and metaphorical deepening; the fire sequence crystallizes the android's transformation from fragmented to whole. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the caretaker accepts the role of ghost-keeper with visible cost (protocol violation, intentional short circuit). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (caretaker, dome, desert roses). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fear-box is opened and the android understands containment as resolution method. Cost is legible in "Emma's fire" and the acceptance of inherited memory.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles neighborhood voices and clues across multiple beats (Mrs. Chen, Mr. Dominquez, Samir, Elena) toward an RR/CR ending where the letters become community testimony. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dawn, courtyard, thrift shop). However, the ending disperses pressure across summary beats (developer arrives, council meetings packed, development stalled) rather than concentrating cost in one on-page image. The mailbox opening itself is a physical act, but the subsequent "display in window → voice found → stalled development" sequence tells rather than shows the closure consequence, diffusing the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (sunken lab, three weeks captive) and follows an accumulative lens: Lyra devises the dance cipher, performs it, and escapes. Causality is loose—the AI accepts her dance as "maintenance protocol" without prior groundwork showing how the system could conflate choreography with code. The closure (emergence into sunlight) lands on the page, but cost is implied rather than viscerally felt; we see triumph without visible forfeiture. The tightening is minimal: the spider's web completion triggers the final roll, but no meaningful narrowing of options precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Causal with lyric-texture accents: whale death → gravity anomalies → memory loss → coffee-ground divination → chamber exhumation → memory restoration. The closure—crystal fracturing and memory returning—lands on-page with cost (Kael's physical and emotional exertion, Mara's hollowed spaces refilled). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (dock, dawn, Kael's job). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael stakes his dive into the chamber on the coffee-ground map. The BRR load is high (~35% backstory/exposition on gravity storms, town lore, superstitions) but remains anchored to present stimuli (the beached whale, Mara's empty eyes) and primes the closure. Pressure accumulates steadily, though the middle sags slightly with expository density. No orientation penalty applied; waiver holds because the pattern is taught and the lens is coherent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: weekly sessions layer images (tea, seal, rooftop, graffiti) toward a climactic ritual. Orientation anchors (Murray Building, Tuesday, November, Alex knocking on 7B) arrive clearly. The closure unit—Alex pressing the seal into the basement wall—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Alex becomes scribe, inheriting Mrs. Voss's custodianship), but the cost is oblique: no on-page sentence shows what Alex forfeits, risks, or loses by taking this role. The final paragraph's recursion (new borrowers, Mrs. Voss refilling the kettle, "agreed-upon lies" stamped again) suggests cyclical endurance, yet the ending feels more thematic echo than a decisive tightening with felt price, capping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a single POV across one twilight-to-dawn window. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara accepts her sister's transformation and relinquishes her need to rationalize it, foregrounding connection over detachment. The cost—surrendering her equations and "charmed skeptic" armor—is legible but conceptual rather than felt in a decisive action. The accumulative lens (textural density building toward a cadence shift) holds through the final image, though the tightening is more thematic restatement than causal pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and presents a clear causal chain: Elara forges a scroll, inserts the thorn into the altar mechanism, and triggers the unlinking of the tyrant's seal. However, the closure effect—"the tyrant's power waned like a fading star" and Elara's return to her studio—occurs largely in summary across multiple paragraphs rather than a single on-page moment with felt cost. The final image ("the unfinished was at last forgiven") offers a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than sharp and visible. The drive lens reads as Causal with a lyric overlay, held consistently, but the ending's off-page summary dilutes the immediacy required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—beats loop through the same "sang a note, echo returned, seashell whispered" structure without meaningful deepening or pattern break. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no taught disorientation pattern (−0.4). The "conspiracy of silence" and "webs of intrigue" are asserted rather than dramatized, and no on-page reversal narrows options. The ending's "purpose crystallized" moment is told summary rather than a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; she walks away unchanged, her vigil continuing exactly as before.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens in medias res at the shrine, then flashes back to months of dream analysis before moving forward to the wreck—spatial and temporal anchors shift without clear transitions, creating mild orientation debt around the 30% mark. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dream fragments mosaic into a map, the melted globe is replaced by a pristine one, and Elias dissipates with "borrowed starlight" resonance. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost gains peace, Maya receives a dream-gift), but the cost is conceptual rather than on-page forfeit—Maya does not visibly sacrifice an alternative or face a trade-off in the final beat, only a quiet reminder of fragility. One meaningful deepening (the lullaby's recovery) tightens the emotional thread, yet the mechanics of how the dream achieves physical manifestation in the waking world are elided without pattern-teaching, weakening causal confidence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece offers no on-page closure with felt cost: the philosopher's vigil continues unchanged, and Kael's apprenticeship is recounted in summary. The story circles back to seasonal repetition without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. Causality is weak; events are strung together by "and then" sequencing rather than because/therefore linkage. The orientation test is satisfied (who/where/when established early), but the lack of a legible closure unit under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Elias discovers letters → reconstructs them → learns about STILLPOINT → decides to reveal the truth. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraphs. The closure unit—his walk toward the council with evidence—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing the choice between revealing truth and maintaining the comfortable lie, though the actual confrontation and its cost remain off-page. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the orchard's secret and the council's complicity, narrowing his options to silence or exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes Atlas at the observatory and moves toward his final broadcast, but the causal chain is largely expositional: we learn he has always planned this, the prophecy has been building for seventeen years, and tonight he completes the mission. The closure—Atlas disappearing after reshaping the world—gestures at cost (the enforcers will come, he abandons his post) but the price is declared rather than dramatized; we don't see what he loses in the moment of transmission. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in ambition but lacks a decisive tightening or reversal that narrows options; the broadcast simply happens as foretold. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when arrive piecemeal across the first third), warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning taught through repeated "dawn's earliest whistle" and jar-stacking motifs. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist shifts from vagrant penny-seller to rooted conduit, opening one jar daily with visible relational cost (now dependent on others' stories). The cost is legible in "no longer vagrant, but rooted in the invisible architecture of sound." One meaningful deepening occurs when she opens all jars at the solstice, reweighting her role from hoarder to distributor. Minor causality skip: the music box suddenly "offered different memories when coaxed with different pressures" without prior setup of this mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors appear by line 5 (engineer, drift-ice marina, sunset, whalebone flute). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory and metaphorical density until the climactic harmonic chord dissolves the creature. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the creature released, the engineer's heart "still tuned to 7.8 hertz, its rhythm changed") with felt cost visible in her altered state. One structural issue: the creature's demand for the flute and the engineer's response via key+voice feel under-motivated; we learn the key can "unbind souls" but not why striking it against her coat buttons at that moment creates the decisive overtone.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of moon-path imagery and patient-revolution rhetoric builds toward the viaduct pulse. However, closure relies on a late-breaking magnetic surge that disables the tyrant's network—a convenience not earned by prior causal pressure; the tyrant and enforcers are mentioned but never constrain Elara's choices on the page. The "unyoke" moment lands as conceptual repricing (people feel mental quiet), but the cost is told, not shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: worker reports loose bolts → ignored → death → Mara finds sabotage evidence → uploads to oversight. The closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost (defying Voss, turning off phone, accepting future battle), and the drought-ending/silence-breaking frame provides conceptual repricing. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The lens reads Causal with thematic accumulation; the final image reweights prior material. Cost is present but muted—Mara's decision feels inevitable rather than wrenching, dampening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (chaplain, workshop, condemned man's box). The piece operates in Accumulative mode: pressure builds through the repair process and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chaplain finds his answer in the repaired music box—a Charged Poise moment that reweights his question about penance versus purpose. However, the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than felt; we do not see what the chaplain sacrifices or forecloses by accepting this answer. The middle deepens through Marlowe's repair work, but the closure unit lacks visible or emotional price on the page, weakening the RR.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring images (arrow, kaleidoscope, algorithm, bell) and density increases as the workshop evolves. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—"the bell was ringing" reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost (the signal exists for no present listener). Orientation is delayed but functional; who-where-when emerge by ~180 words without prohibitive confusion. The arrow's transformation from kill-code to creation-code provides one meaningful deepening, yet the protagonist's role remains facilitative rather than conflicted, limiting escalation's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a causal investigative structure: she finds the patch, traces the numbers, forges clearance, discovers the video, uploads it. However, the closure lacks visible cost—uploading to a secure mirror and whispering numbers feels like continuation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that forecloses a path. The orientation is clear early (archive, memory keeper, cold case). The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at the ending beat shows what she has risked or lost by exposing the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines (lighthouse orchard, ice floes, Kael, shattered crystal). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers mirrors, blood, and shadow-lace toward the crystal's reconstitution. Closure occurs on the page—the crystal reforms, the community sees the floe pattern—but the cost is declared ("what he'd given, and what he'd gained") rather than shown in a specific forfeited option or visible consequence, weakening the felt price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (drift-ice marina, volunteer context), and the accumulative/textural lens is signaled early through recurring images. However, the closure unit—her decision to continue volunteering and accept "windborne solace"—lacks a legible cost that forecloses a path; she arrived seeking death and leaves choosing life, but the transition occurs through poetic summary rather than a dramatized tightening or renunciation with stakes on the page. The "euthanasia tourist" frame is dropped rather than paid off with visible consequence. The middle trawling beats feel ornamental rather than narrowing options toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation debt: "after the final bus departed the vacant station" suggests recent action, but the story never anchors when this occurs relative to the present scene or how much time elapses across twenty-seven paragraphs of wandering and writing. The drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught by midpoint. No decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing lands on the page; the ending ("the vineyard would keep its secrets") asserts continuation rather than reconfiguring prior material with cost. The sentinel's burial of the vial and sealing of his own letter are gestures without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens early but never tightens or deepens pressure—sand parts, stone pulses, echo preserved, walker leaves—without a meaningful turn or cost that narrows options. The "echo of wisdom" closure is asserted complete but the text does not show what was risked, lost, or transformed; the walker's task simply ends with no before/after legible in her situation or stance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear but the dominant stake—preserve the echo—remains abstract and untested by on-page complication. The ending offers recurrence (clearings, parapet pulsing) but no resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The archivist begins arranging photographs and continues without alteration; the ending ("one last photograph in the arc, completing the circle for now") is a continuation, not a closure unit. The piece summarizes years of gradual transformation ("slowly, imperceptibly at first, the town began to heal") rather than dramatizing a before/after with felt stakes. Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge cleanly, waiving −0.3 to −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (testimonies as layered fragments) and deepens through accretion of voices until Elias's absence reweights the premise. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): he places the crystal back, walks toward the doors—each step a testimony against the silence he perpetuated. Cost is legible in the torn page and the departure. Orientation anchors by line 3 (library, dawn, Elias). One micro-turn (crystal returns nothing) sets up the final renunciation. The causal chain is indirect but coherent under the accumulative lens: discovery → weeks cataloging → condemnation → self-test → desperate reading → placement and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates fog, chalk, driftwood, and VCR imagery toward a final spiral gesture that functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the prophet captures the echo momentarily, then releases it). Orientation anchors early (junkyard, fog, dawn). Cost is conceptual—he knows the memory will slip—but the final image ("chalk spiral... a silent witness") reweights the longing without a felt price in altered options. The "tidal breath" climax emerges without prior causal tightening; it arrives as atmosphere rather than escalation under pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but escalation remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (spinning clock, falling leaf, captured starlight) toward a cadence shift when the clock hand "matched the leaf's fall." Orientation anchors arrive early (lunar observatory, Kael's workshop, shaking foundations). Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration—the observatory steadies, the star's light is preserved—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what Kael forfeited or what path closed. The final leaf-fall whisper ("promise that nothing ever truly vanishes") attempts conceptual repricing but restates theme rather than reweighting prior pressure with undeniable expense.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vinyl shard, humming method, and "scent of hope" motif recur to charge the reconciliation. Orientation is clean (hospice solarium, blood work result, estranged daughter). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the silence cracks, the broken record becomes "whole again"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally felt on the page. The line "their melody rose, a radiant haven above the clouds, where pain could not reach" abstracts the moment instead of grounding it in specific action or loss, weakening the closure's grip.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens: Elara identifies the problem, hypothesizes a solution, and enacts it through the key and rune sequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, fractured-world when) arrive promptly. However, the closure—"shadows knew their place"—lands as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost; the automaton's sealing is described but the price to Elara or the world remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs (the final loop's reversal), meeting minimum escalation, but the ending resolves too neatly without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena accepts her failure and commits to correction, foreclosing her former career stance. The lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering (garden as metaphor), held cleanly. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. One meaningful turn (the tooth's arrival reframes the entire premise) tightens options. Cost is visible—undoing three decades of work—but felt more through summary than a single charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers polishing, placement, and village response to build resonance. Orientation anchors (Mira, grotto, mist) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pearl is placed and draws villagers, reweighting Mira's solitary mission into communal glow. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mira's heart "held a pearl of stillness" is assertion, not a dramatized forfeiture or renunciation. The ending extends into summary ("each piece she polished became a new pearl") rather than a charged final image, diluting the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, data center, three weeks post-confession) are established early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: daily moss-tending rituals deepen into a plan to share sanctuary. However, the closure unit is weakly executed—"tomorrow, she would begin documenting" is future intention, not an on-page decisive change or felt reconfiguration. The cost (career, reputation, sanity) is backstory-only; the present moment offers no credible price beyond standing and breathing. The lens holds, but the final beat lacks the tightening or cadence shift required for resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mist and shell recur, ghosts multiply, density increases toward the shell-planting moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first lines. Closure exists—shell into earth, transformation declared—but the cost remains asserted ("lighter," "finally free") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible constraint. The piece teaches its pattern (lyric recursion of prompts) but the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt price that would elevate it beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dawn hush → song → vine revival → community gathering builds through density and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening arbor description. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sacred practice restored as "living thread"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The "remedy" arc (weeks of tinkering → forgotten song) functions but the song's mechanics are asserted rather than tested against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when early (flash-paper alchemist, subarctic crater orchard, Great Silence). Causality is weakly accumulative: the alchemist performs a ritual, follows the resulting map, and finds the child—an and-then chain with minimal narrowing of options. The closure is a Decisive Change (reunion), but the cost is invisible; the map simply leads her to a warm cabin where the child sleeps safely, offering no felt sacrifice or foreclosed path. The Great Silence lifts conveniently at the exact moment the map is complete, a coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. One meaningful tightening is absent; pressure does not escalate or deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (cavern, locksmith, broken timer) and the causal lens holds: he studies angles, discovers temporal echoes, grinds lenses, installs them, and the mechanism clicks. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (release replaces harvest), and the cost is conceptual—wonder stored not in a cellar but in shared flow—legible in the final image of "angled light." One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes overload caused the break and redesigns the harvest. Minor weaknesses: the seventeen-day span compresses key turns into summary ("spent days grinding," "worked without haste"), and the stakes never narrow options on the page; he completes each step without friction or trade-off, which keeps escalation gentle and caps the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (bronze grotto, starlight, seventeen years trapped). The closure—stepping through walls after calcifying all burdens into a sphere—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the trap was always a loom), but the cost remains oblique: what exactly does she forfeit by leaving, or what path is foreclosed? The accumulative/textural lens holds across the piece, yet the final image ("stepped through the wall as though it were woven air") asserts freedom without demonstrating on-page friction or visible trade-off at that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara carves, places the prism, pours tea, and reflects on transformation. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options—each stroke and the prism placement occur without resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The closure reconfigures meaning thematically ("the lesson was not to hold on, but to let the memory transform") but the conceptual cost remains asserted rather than felt in a specific image or forfeited option. The prism's "crystallized time" method is invoked but not dramatized as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate until the ghost offers collaboration. Orientation anchors (carousel, lagoon, scavenger role) arrive early. The closure—"weaving my own narrative" and "negotiating peace"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; the text does not show what path is foreclosed or what specific price the protagonist pays for this peace.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece accumulates Mira's repairs (water, solar panels, sextant transmitter) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal shifts from ruin to launchpad for community imagination. Orientation is clear early (abandoned terminal, post-carnival). However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mira "walks away" with no visible price paid, no option foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized on the page. The accumulative lens holds through the ending, but the final image ("already sketching the next set of flows") asserts renewal without undeniable pressure or sacrifice, weakening the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (petrichor, gears, whispers) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara stands and the "weight she had borne for two decades dissolve[s] into the crystal." Cost is felt (twenty years of grief, the daughter's departure) and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors are present early (clock scribe, sanctuary, forecourt, post-storm dawn). One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides not to repair but to surrender the gears, narrowing her emotional options. The lens holds without contradiction, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors appear by the opening (who, where, when), but the dominant stake—understanding lies—remains abstract throughout. The story presents a single beat: Elara finds a hidden chamber and retrieves a map. No reversal or tightening occurs; the discovery is frictionless. The ending offers no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; she simply moves forward with new information, serene and unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening lines). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara secures the wisp-grass method and "confirmation that the secret weavers still spoke"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. The final image reweights prior material through the "page written in frost and lantern light" motif, yet no live option is foreclosed and no tactical price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs (fulgurite reveals the final sequence), satisfying the length requirement, but the ending reads more like retrieval than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.7)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric patterning, recurrent images), but no meaningful cadence shift or density increase reweights the dominant stake at closure. The ending ("she turned toward the horizon") offers neither Decisive Change nor Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the thread's release is symbolic gesture without on-page consequence. Orientation is present early (garden, autumn, palace), so no penalty there. The "geography of healing" remains conceptual metaphor never dramatized as a stake that narrows options or alters knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative lens holds: discovery → assembly → hatching → song's spread. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the hybrid creature's song bridges two worlds, but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than legible in a specific sentence or image. The meaningful tightening occurs when the egg cracks and the flawed genesis emerges, reweighting the premise. However, the final paragraphs loop through similar observations without a decisive final pressure point that makes the cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors appear early (who, where), satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal pressure tightens options: Maya arrives, sings, binds the wing, and departs without a reversal or cost that forecloses a path. The closure image (walking away with coin, thread, and song) is a summary statement rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration with visible price. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the ending merely restates the opening premise without reweighting it through an on-page beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening, and the piece follows a single-POV, single-scene structure. However, closure lacks visible cost: Kael opens the box, memories spill out, fountains flow—no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The ending accumulates lyric images but does not reconfigure stakes or meaning with felt consequence, falling short of Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors drift—who/where/when emerge gradually through metaphor rather than concrete grounding by ~120 words, creating mild disorientation that is never fully taught as pattern. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "infinity itself was just another kind of fire, one that consumed by repeating," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. However, the escalation is primarily thematic accumulation rather than causal narrowing of options, and the gear's dissolution lacks visible consequence that alters Elara's final stance. One meaningful deepening occurs (gear → ancestral memory → solution), but the cost at closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Kael, greenhouse, monarchs arriving). The piece accumulates through repeated evening walks and ribbon-reading to reach a conceptual repricing: the spiral form as collective grief's shape. However, the six-week ellipsis compresses all escalation into summary, and the cost—time, isolation, uncertainty—remains asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. Closure lands with the finished stone and villagers' recognition, but the decisive moment (chiseling the spiral) lacks on-page resistance or surprise that would mark a true turn.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through inscriptions that reweight the dominant stake (restoring balance), culminating in Elara's shift from penance to shared burden with visible cost (truth revealed, simpler narrative foreclosed). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she becomes "both winder and witness," accepting the truth's cost and the town's continuing ignorance. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening line (who, where, when). The pendulum's pause motif seeds early and charges the final image ("one careful swing at a time"), creating tight causality under the lens. One small friction: the sea "erasing physical evidence" risks feeling convenient, though it lands as thematic echo rather than plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational framing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive piecemeal—cemetery, gardener, silo—but the chess-clock frame remains unexplained past the opening, creating minor disorientation debt. The tapestry-decoding supplies a potential closure structure, yet the ending offers only a recirculation of prior images without a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the gardener walks away unchanged, and the "uncharted echoes" remain abstract rather than dramatized consequences. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options between midpoint and close.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (obsidian spire, frozen lake, settlement below). The dominant stake—seed innovation before the quartz vein fails—is signaled early and culminates in the elders' approval, a Decisive Change that forecloses the path of inaction with implicit cost (drilling risk, generational training commitment). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Kaelen gathers data, refines models, writes, presents, and the council agrees; pressure tightens through her iterative constraint-solving. One hiccup: the elders' reversal happens off-stage emotionally; we see the head elder trace and nod but not the friction or micro-turns that make the cost felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear anchors (who, where) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira receives the broadcast, transcribes it, imagines the dust as audience, and closes on a note of completed ritual. The closure reads as Charged Poise—she has woven the message, the orchestra will perform tomorrow—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. No on-page sentence makes the price of this defiance or the risk of discovery legible in a concrete image. The lens holds, but closure lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and what "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" means remains unclear past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece follows an Accumulative lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (she scatters ash and walks away), but the cost is conceptual and unfelt on the page; no visible option is foreclosed or tactic altered by the ending. Causality is thin: she enters, powders the mask, realizes the emotion escaped, and leaves without a meaningful tightening that narrows choices. The closure image (ash on palms, mask left behind) attempts Charged Poise but lacks undeniable pressure or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal arc: Malach discovers the cog, deliberates which narrative to encode, files the data, and hides it before the patrol passes. Orientation anchors (sewer, plague aftermath, Malach's purpose) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Malach completes his encoding and slips away, leaving the cog as a quiet rebellion; the cost is visible in his choice to preserve method over safety and his acceptance of erasure. One persistent constraint—Council patrols and executions—shapes his tactics throughout, charging the final image of the hidden cog.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through subtraction culminates in the shared chord, then jumps decades to Marco-as-teacher in a lyric reprise. Orientation anchors early (velvet library, autumn, Mrs. Kaelin, students arriving). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the rosette passed on, the method preserved—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no single on-page forfeiture or trade-off crystallizes at the ending beat. The decades-long ellipsis and summary layering ("In coming years, the conservatory would close") dilute immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The celestial alignment provides a frame, and the sequence—prune, plant, water, sprout, taste—follows clear causal steps under a hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative texture at closure). However, closure lacks visible cost: Mara tastes the fruit and smiles; no prior option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The ending reconfigures nothing with felt consequence, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned transformation. Apply −0.6 for cost-proof test failure and cap eligibility accordingly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when promptly and follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara finds the box, climbs the tower, activates the honeycomb, and waits as wonder-charged current flows. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her role as "keeper of that particular charge" and reconfigures routine into revelation with felt cost (she must wait, the lights have not yet returned). One meaningful deepening occurs when the honeycomb releases its charge and the city begins to remember wonder, narrowing her stance from passive tollgate operator to active keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but remains unfocused; the piece loops through repeated sanctification beats without meaningful tightening or a decisive reweighting. No on-page closure: the protagonist continues unchanged, stakes remain abstract, and the final paragraph recycles the opening's claim without cost. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when take ~180 words to anchor with no functional payoff. The ending offers thematic assertion ("every act of noticing can sanctify the world") in place of a scene-pressure image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Petra, drowned garden, post-diver moment) arrive within the first 50 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Petra commits to eternal vigilance as a guardian of questions rather than answers, welcoming the next generation with telepathic openness. The cost is legible—stone lips crack, decades pass, the dome fractures—and the final image reweights the premise from preserving certainty to nurturing doubt. One meaningful deepening occurs when Petra threads the ampoule's memories through the dome's weakness and feels the city's own doubt respond. However, the closure moment ("Welcome") is somewhat diffuse across the final third rather than crystallized in a single decisive beat, and the conceptual cost (abandoning dogma) is clearer than the felt emotional price at the exact closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through recursive imagery (steps, dice, proofs) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Elias steps forward past the rupture, forecloses escape, and accepts the weighted dice as a permanent companion. The closure carries felt cost—he chooses perpetual climb over resolution—and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, infinite staircase, timeless) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when double-sixes trigger the rupture, then the chipped die's three-face forces the choice, narrowing options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story assembles recurring images (moon, brush, greenhouse, script) toward a final resonance where tokens appear at the mural, but the closure unit is diffuse—watched ripples rather than a decisive on-page change in Kael's options or knowledge. The orientation is clear early (rooftop greenhouse, Ashglow, Kael). One tightening occurs when Mira notices the mural and leaves herbs, yet that beat is narrated from Kael's distance without a felt cost that forecloses a path. The ending recapitulates the vigil without a visible price or renunciation on the page, landing as thematic echo rather than resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: the inciting incident (beekeeper's departure) is backstory, and the immediate goal (thaw the harp) materializes abruptly without on-page discovery or complication. The piece strings decorative beats (museum tour, bread ritual, lens-focusing) without clear because/therefore linkage; the ice melts because Liora decides it will, not through earned pressure or reversals. Closure lacks visible cost—the harp plays, children dance, and the ending summarizes future rituals rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (rituals, loaves, lens) and Causal (thaw the harp), but neither coheres at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the yoyo puzzle provides a because/therefore sequence, while recurring images (lighthouse, tide, hunger stone) accumulate toward the closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. The central problem—reversing the hunger stone's curse—is set up, pursued through the yoyo mechanism, and resolved on the page with a beam flare and a saved boat. However, the cost at closure is asserted rather than felt: "the hunger stone would eventually hunger again" offers mild contingency but no immediate forfeiture or trade-off that makes the victory bittersweet. The ending reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the light reclaimed, fate defied), but the conceptual or felt price remains oblique, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Hybrid: causal pressure (photo → funhouse → confrontation) overlaid with accumulative/textural design (riddles, luminance motifs). Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—fear's weakness revealed as inability to affect survivors—but the cost remains abstract; Mira walks out carrying the clasp "like a scar," yet no prior scene shows what path she foreclosed or what she sacrificed beyond enduring the encounter. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first few lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entities circle her and she forces the question, but the escalation from entry to climax feels more like traversal than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the final paragraph reweights "the space between forecast and creation" as the true instrument. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (prophet, orchard, storm approaching). The piece achieves one meaningful deepening—the storm becomes partner rather than threat—but cost remains asserted ("turning every obstacle") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—Kael discovers the watchers are historians cataloging failed curiosity, inherits her mother's cracked-whistle key, and chooses to speak their language anyway by carving a question mark they will see. Cost is conceptual and relational (her mother was catalogued; the gate rusts from understanding) and felt in the sunwashed dread she now owns. One watcher raises a hand, reweighting prior material. Escalation proceeds through pattern-discovery and the harmonic whistle blow that shifts the turtle and turns the watchers' heads, narrowing ignorance into knowledge with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the station's decay accumulates symbolic weight through repeated parallels, leading to a Conceptual Repricing where truth "climbs out of the pit and into the light." However, the closure lacks visible cost—Emlyn departs satisfied, the community accepts her findings without friction, and roses bloom as pure affirmation. The middle section (letter discovery to journal entry) offers thematic deepening but no meaningful tightening of options or stakes. Causality is present but gentle; because/therefore links exist (she came for the letter, found it, published) yet pressure never escalates to force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening beat (drawbridge, seaward parapet, three-day window), infers an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint (pressure builds through repeated note-placing rather than causal reversals), and lands closure via Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: Elias's ledger report and the delay request crystallize his new stance with conceptual cost (defying Authority, carrying secrets). The escalation is a single decisive deepening: wresting the cornerstone and embedding his own declaration transforms routine inspection into covert memorial practice. Cost is legible in "the antique traveling inkwell was empty now, but his work had just begun" and the solitary walk toward the next district, foreclosing official retreat. One persistent constraint—the raised drawbridge and three-day isolation—shapes both tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is established (sunken library, blackout, Mira alone), and the story follows a causal thread: Mira finds stamp → matches watermark → discovers guild registry → identifies Aldric. However, the closure lacks felt cost; the blackout lifts conveniently, power returns, and Mira simply smiles as her work concludes. The final image ("light held steady and the water outside receded") reclaims stillness but does not demonstrate what was foreclosed or transformed by her choices. The lens reads Causal but the ending delivers restoration without visible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge piecemeal across the opening third without a clear anchor by ~120 words; reader must assemble "lantern maker on floating island after shadow left" from distributed fragments (−0.4). The piece unfolds as accumulative texture—polishing dreams, folding cranes—but no on-page beat narrows options or changes knowledge with visible cost. The ending reunites shadow and daughter's breath in a final lantern, yet this arrives as summary declaration ("she placed it inside") without a prior constraint or trade-off; closure reads as awarded fulfillment rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening sentence (observatory, three kilometers above, geode against scanner). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through perturbed readings, geode warming, and the final image of refracted starlight reweighting "unused potential" into "infinitely remembered." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the hunt shifts from extraction to witnessing with conceptual cost ("potential stopped being unused and became, instead, infinitely remembered"). Deduct −0.4 for causality fuzziness: why the breakers blew and what "twenty minutes" materially changes remains abstract, and the locked coordinates never force a follow-on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear quest structure: find the chip, decode the frequency. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The central closure—transmitting the decoded frequency and receiving a chorus of recognition—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract and told rather than felt. The lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture; escalation is present (pinion sequence, decoding), but the final image does not reweight prior material with visible sacrifice or foreclosed options. The pilgrim's flight is mentioned but never explored as a consequence Elara must face.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: driftwood fragments and carved images layer toward a final discovery. Orientation anchors who and conceptual premise early, but "where" (cobalt terrace vs. forgotten shore) and "when" remain vague past the 120-word mark without payoff. The closure unit—uncovering the mother's name on a plaque—is a reveal rather than a choice that forecloses options; the protagonist does not act, he passively discovers, and the subsequent "decision" to stop forging is told in summary with no visible cost on the final page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; Q3 cap at 7.0 is triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density and ritual timing shape the exchange. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the parapet stands empty, trust forged in the space between apology and forgiveness—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized. The "fragile trust" and "step toward recycling the bitter past" are told in summary; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift makes the price legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening lines, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a decisive renunciation). Orientation anchors appear early (coastal kayak launch, seven-mile route). The closure—Elias setting down the compass and walking away—lands on the page as Earned Stasis with felt cost (foregoing the instrument, accepting navigation by memory). One meaningful deepening occurs when fog erases the third pole and he chooses to drift rather than fight. The piece teaches its reflective, lyric pattern early and holds it through closure, though the density of backstory (sister's death, three-year guilt) approaches but does not exceed the BRR threshold when measured against present micro-choices (pulling out the compass, releasing it, walking toward the cemetery).

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: by line 12 we know "Kael" and "underground," but motive and immediate situation remain vague until the newspaper clue around line 7–8. The closure unit—Kael ascending with the baseball, whispering "Elias"—reads as Charged Poise (options crystallized, cost implied in the "cold and indifferent" surface world), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in a final image that reweights prior material. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (newspaper clues → labyrinth navigation) and Accumulative (bioluminescent motifs, "jaded wonder" refrain), never fully committing; the ending leans lyric but the causal setup creates expectation debt. No meaningful tightening occurs—Kael retrieves the baseball without resistance, and the cavern-trembling is a brief micro turn that deflates immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who (beast whisperer), where (orchard), and when (after phoenix rises) are anchored within bounds; waive penalty. Drive lens: attempts Accumulative/Textural (spice ritual layering), but the closure lacks visible cost—the beloved simply answers, the bond reforges without forfeit or friction. No meaningful tightening occurs: each paragraph reiterates the same transformation without narrowing options or escalating stakes. The ending grants the protagonist everything (beast form, beloved's presence, guardian role) with no felt price, failing the Cost proof test. No before/after is legible because the protagonist never loses, trades, or renounces anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (crack, ink, mist, hands) to reweight the mother-daughter time-debt without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line two; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that lost time transformed rather than vanished). However, the reconfiguration is told in summary ("every lost moment had been transformed, not erased") rather than enacted, and no visible cost appears—she leaves with cards and saucer intact, daughter waiting. The midpoint deepening (crack weeps light, voice whispers) adds density but does not narrow options or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers density through the photograph-stitching ritual, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Maya refuses escape and chooses ongoing witness. Orientation anchors quickly (AI on recycled ship, post-human universe). The closure lands with felt cost—she turns from salvation to continued caretaking—and the lens holds. One weakness: the quantum-core discovery and Kwan Yin's Tear mechanics arrive without prior setup, creating a minor causality hiccup in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors adequately (Kael, black sand beach, volcanic setting, celestial alignment) within the opening lines. The closure unit—releasing the bugs, understanding saving and being saved as one motion—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than concretely foregrounded; the village waking to clean water is told aftermath, not on-page consequence that Kael witnesses or trades against. The causal chain from dislodged stone → pig → bird → fish → clogged filter is mechanical coincidence that solves a problem Kael did not know existed, undercutting agency at closure. The inferred lens is Hybrid (causal setup, accumulative/textural lyric resolution), but the coincidence machinery weakens the earned quality of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The piece establishes early anchors (fort, blackout, Seren's role) and chains discoveries logically: sundial → quill holder → magazine → pneumatic charge. However, the causal links depend heavily on off-page deduction—the reader is told the geometry "mapped perfectly" and that she "measured one keg" without witnessing the problem-solving struggle. The closure lands (unlocked doors as silent revolution) but the decisive change occurs off-page between paragraphs; we see only aftermath and reflection. Cost is conceptual (her complicity, the commandant's betrayal) but not felt in a specific forfeiture or relationship fracture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, when anchor by line 3; waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: aurora, dust, rocks, and eels build density toward a pattern-recognition climax. Closure unit: Elara lets the glow fade and accepts witnessing over solving—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is conceptual ("the promise still lingering, now a quiet hum") but not viscerally felt on the page; the decision to stop lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative that the text dramatizes. The lens holds, but the RR lacks sharp-edged cost, capping mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers poetic images (storm, scars, masks, timer, envelope) without clear causal linkage; the poet's opening of the envelope and decision to write arrive without prior beats that narrow options or raise cost. The closure moment—writing the uncensored poem and descending with it—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet now "reads" his scars and breaks the vigil), but the cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page; no visible price (risk, forfeiture, relational loss) anchors the shift. Orientation is stable (poet, observatory, storm night), but the accumulative pressure does not tighten or deepen meaningfully; the final act feels like a thematic declaration rather than a reweighting shaped by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough, but causality remains decorative rather than propulsive. The needle card "reveals" coordinates, the sundial "confirms" the path, and the duel concludes because Rhen "seized the moment"—all outcomes arrive by authorial convenience rather than because/therefore linkage or accumulative pressure that narrows options. The closure unit lacks visible cost: the duel ends with a bow, the card goes back in the pocket, and Rhen walks away with "newfound direction" asserted rather than reweighted on the page. Orientation Test satisfied; closure form (Decisive Change or RR) not demonstrated with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (poetry-resistance metaphor accretes through library rebuilding). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the passed coffee tin and Cora's final reading, but cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page trade-off for his release or her continued imprisonment. The Orientation Test passes (vagrant poet, city streetlights, judge/prison anchored by ~10% of text). One tightening occurs when the molt approaches and he chooses continuity, but the choice lacks prior dramatized stakes. The mosaic structure (22 shards) teaches its pattern early and transitions remain legible, qualifying under Track B, yet the closure image ("somewhere under the same stars, Cora reads...") displaces present pressure to an off-page future.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles atmospheric fragments (station, film archive, airship ascent, arbor arrival, final performance) and signals closure through the encore and the compasses finding peace. Cost is implied—he leaves the station, plays until his fingers bleed—but the decision to depart and the stakes of that departure are told rather than tested in a moment of friction. The orientation anchors (station, pianist, storm approaching) land early; the closure image (encore complete, compasses still, arbor as refuge) reweights the opening longing, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, though the cost arrives in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density (blooming equations, monsoon countdown, fading luminescence) and culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration when the ridge awakens and returns the chants to the elders. Orientation anchors (Kael, ridge, spring bloom, monsoon countdown) arrive early. The cost is conceptual—"had he preserved cultural memory or merely created a new fiction"—and legible in the final doubt. One minor causality gap: the transition from placing the seed to singing feels under-motivated; the text tells us "no checker had done this in three generations" but doesn't dramatize why Kael makes that leap now.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mara, ferry, islet). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara accepts that severance heals by "growing around the wound" and the compass now points to the juniper. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than viscerally on-page—we're told she spent three seasons learning patience but the final image shows settled acceptance without a visible price paid in that ending beat. The narrative jumps forward in time ("Years later") which diffuses the closure moment's immediacy.

Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure's accumulative pattern teaches early and pays off.


== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight: one primary scene in the greenhouse, a brief transition drive, and return to the observatory, all cohering under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing—her stance on “noise” changes and reweights all prior imagery with a clear before/after. Causality is quiet but coherent: the flood’s aftermath → greenhouse visit → butterfly/dust encounter → reframed view of work. Stakes and cost (abandoning her old certainties) are implicit yet legible in the final decision to “learn to hear both.”

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—attempt on his life → flight into canyon → frost as code → hidden furnace/inheritance → decision to use art and ledger against smugglers—is coherent and easy to track. The piece delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Kael leaves with a plan and reweighted sense of self and legacy, with ongoing danger acknowledged. However, key moves (the frost perfectly mapping the ledger, the conveniently warm furnace) feel like benevolent coincidences rather than pressures he works for, softening cost. The smuggler threat remains entirely offstage, so the external plotline is more gestured at than truly activated.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: shipwreck → silent world → conservatory stasis → discovery of the frost pattern → three-fork “performance” → communal ritual and reframed silence. Causality holds: her skills and tools lead logically to the experiment, which leads to a new communal practice and inner reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined as “canvas” with an implied emotional cost in relinquishing the old world of sound. The one limitation is that pressure never tightens sharply; events unfold with little real resistance or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: package → discovery of lens and note → haunting signals → dream-revealed method → reconstruction → activation → permanent entrapment in the role of beacon-keeper. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and the closure is a clear Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse’s purpose is repurposed, but the cost is the undertaker’s eternal service. The ending’s realization that the “package had not brought them a tool, but a sentence” lands the before/after with undeniable cost. Reflection is interleaved with concrete developments, so momentum and orientation never blur.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure—successive nights, the innovation of stories, then the “Bell of Memory” festival—reads cleanly and coherently under a textural drive lens. Causality is soft but present: Mara’s initiatives lead to new communal practices, and the bell’s role intensifies to closure. However, there is almost no moment where an option is genuinely foreclosed or a cost made sharp; everything unfolds smoothly with little friction. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, but it lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece works well as an accumulative/textural structure: breath, fog, light, and memory layer toward the realization of where unused love is stored. Causality is soft but legible—her prayer to know where love is stored triggers the crystal’s pulse, the corridor, and then the release. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: before she is seeking; after, she understands and has released the love. Stakes and cost are modest, though, with no real sense that another outcome was possible, which keeps the arc from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent and satisfying: halo fragment → retrocognitive trap → obsessive experimentation with hyperbolic geometry → alignment attempt → disintegration into the garden. The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure, but the beats still progress cleanly toward a closure with real cost. Closure is strong: she becomes the very medium she tried to map, and the halo fragment’s inert return plus the visitors’ experience complete a neat loop. Some middle beats are summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps the structure clean but slightly flattens moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the vault → puzzle of piano keys → wall movement and activation of sentry → fight that allows the final key press → access to seeds and emergence into the barren world. Closure is solid and visible: he has the seeds, the wall is down, and he begins planting despite remaining bound. The story maintains a single continuous scene with coherent spatial logic and no orientation issues. However, the turns are largely expected and rarely complicate the situation in surprising or ambivalent ways.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: Lyra’s work with absences, the dead forge, and the orchard builds toward the forge’s reignition and her final conceptual shift about trust. Causality is coherent within the premise (reactor → ash-imprints → forge reignites with compressed memory → device amplifies the silence). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she redefines betrayal as transmission loss and symbolically abandons her device. The main weakness is that the decisive external turn—the forge relighting—arrives as a quasi-miracle rather than arising from her last, specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal spine—decode flowers → find bench → discover portrait → solve moon-coin riddle → board train—is coherent and easy to follow, with a single POV and continuous scene. However, each step unfolds smoothly without serious obstacles or reversals, so beats feel like a sequence of discoveries rather than escalating tests. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Lux reframes theft as “translation” and recommits to her path), but the cost of that choice is barely felt. As an accumulative/lyric piece it holds together structurally, yet it lacks a decisive tightening that would make the before/after truly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: present-time spring visit → backstory of Lena and the dam → new leak → decision to make “The Reservoir of Unasked Things” → ritual placement and descent. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: the thaw and leak prompt the bowl, which enables the bookmark ritual and his reframed understanding. Closure is strong—a resonant reconfiguration marked by the bowl left as an ongoing vessel and the gauge’s flicker as a subtle, costly before/after. No major orientation or logic slips, and the emotional cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: betrayal → need to escape → decrypting the cast → outwitting the AI → disabling tracking → extraction, with a clear before/after at closure. Orientation is strong; we always know we’re in the rusted library under the dome and roughly where we are in the escape. However, key turns (the password “FEARLESS,” the shouted phrase disabling tracking) feel somewhat convenient and under-contested, softening the sense of earned difficulty. Still, the closure—gaining a path off-station and a new self-concept—lands on the page with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival → consultation → acquisition of map → departure into endless night. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: silence becomes a navigational tool, and the last star going out reweights the map’s importance. However, the drive is extremely low-pressure; beats feel like variations on one tone rather than turns that meaningfully narrow options. Causality is intact but gentle and almost entirely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: routine task → encounter violin → trigger loops → experimentation → integration → reconfigured return to duty. The accumulative/textural pattern of increasingly surreal loops is coherent and culminates in a clear closure beat when J-3 plucks the final chord and the timelines unify. Cost is implicit but legible: he accepts ongoing servitude with new awareness rather than transcending his role. Structure is linear and solid, though the escalation feels more like a smooth gradient than a sharply defined turn, which keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: lens → hidden doodles → timestamps → projection → confrontation → confession → renewed trust, with no major orientation or logic issues. Closure is on-page and legible, but the resolution is extremely easy—there’s no real obstacle once she has the evidence, and all parties accept it immediately. The structure is essentially a straight line without meaningful complication or a felt price. This keeps it competent but below truly competitive literary rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: wilted rosebush → realization that his luck is failing → decision to confess → heirs’ acceptance → quiet epilogue. Structure, though, leans heavily on summary after the central scene, and the “problem” (fear of replacement, fading life force) is resolved too smoothly, with no turn where things genuinely threaten to go the other way. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—he tells the truth and remains, with a reweighted understanding of luck—but the cost is faint. The world’s luck mechanics and the garden’s responsiveness are mostly asserted rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is strong: rare orbital/magnetic alignment → Kael’s preparation → the power diversion → the sideways-time vision → the aftermath with Chen. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first lines, and the single-scene structure is clean. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Kael gains proof and a secret while the world will misread the data, with an implied career and ethical cost. The main limitation is that the consequences remain mostly conceptual and deferred rather than biting sharply in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: find program → decode stains as code → play sequence → manifestation → dilemma → decisive final note. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change where the ghost departs and Mara’s relationship to inspiration shifts—with a clear before/after. The stakes around “disrupting the delicate equilibrium” remain somewhat abstract, and the cost of freeing the ghost feels more thematic than viscerally dramatized. Still, the scene holds together and pays off its setup without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: repeated passes over instruments, aurora, margins, and the illustration build toward the conceptual turn that the “weight” is forgiveness, not grams. Causality is modest but present—smudge → memory of colleague → rediscovery attempt → repricing of the secret’s weight—and closure is a clear reconfiguration rather than a simple fade-out. However, escalation is very gentle and somewhat circular; several late sentences reiterate what’s already been earned instead of adding a sharper final tightening or new consequence. Structure is coherent and oriented, but not yet at the incisive compression expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: inheritance of a confession → return to the mill with the wheel → tunnel fork → turning the wheel as key → confrontation and release of the ghost shift → decision to confess publicly. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with backstory woven in, and closure lands via a decisive change (releasing the ghosts) plus a reconfiguration of Elias’s stance toward silence. The “truth has mass”/beads-count mechanic is simple but coherent within the story’s logic. A slight sense of convenience arises from the radio callers describing precisely the object and phenomenon he carries, which edges toward schematic rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is accumulative and clear: refuge → need to burrow deeper → discovery of swan’s geometry → tunnel → chamber → realization → return and release. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; the origami activation is a motivated turn, and the closure is a quiet Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing around “burrowing into silence.” The main weakness is low on-page jeopardy: preserving “fragile knowledge” never faces a concrete test, so the stakes remain abstract. Still, the pattern of setup/use/reprise around the swan and refuges lands a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival → preparation → eclipse/music → brief miracle → aftermath, with clear causal links (Mira times her session to the eclipse, plays the lullaby, the connection occurs during totality). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s understanding of wonder shifts and the world outside carries on indifferent, underlining cost and solitude of the experience. The structure is accumulative but not vague; recurring motifs (cedar, roots, keepsake, eclipse) braid into a coherent before/after. The only thing holding it short of the very top tier is that the miracle’s mechanism remains deliberately mysterious, so the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized through altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of fireplace → diaries → pattern of dreams → realization about dreams migrating into matter → acceptance of his role. Causality within the premise is internally consistent, and orientation (who/where/when) is established early without confusion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what “walls have heard” becomes literal and reweights every prior detail. The main limitation is that most turns are intellectual rather than dramatized in scene, keeping the stakes a step abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the specs → realization of a new use for her power → targeted fortunes → observed outcomes → self-rewriting at the end. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when and the lighthouse’s dual role (pub/espionage relic) are clear early. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from reactive seer to intentional composer of futures, with the name-change fortune closing the loop. The main structural limitation is that the middle “test run” successes come very easily, with no structural complication or near-failure to tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: recording silence → layering paradoxical questions → entity’s destabilization → full-loop climax. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early despite the metaphysical premise, and the monastery’s dimensional-anchoring rule is consistent and paid off when it “groaned” during the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the exorcism succeeds, but the real before/after lies in how silence and faith are reweighted, with shaken certainties and exposed wounds. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: desk → balcony → shell-blown note → symphony → resonant spire → return to work, all under a “before exhaustion hits” clock. Causality is coherent within a lyrical, slightly surreal frame, and closure is clear: she achieves the role she’s longed for, reconfiguring her relationship to time and silence. The return to the scrolls with new charge provides a satisfying cadence. The cost of success and the practical stakes of failure remain somewhat soft, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a largely linear causal spine housed within an accumulative lyric structure, from viaduct → chambers → revelation → dissolution, with clear internal logic. The closure—a conceptual repricing where escape becomes surrender and authorship—is on the page and coherent, with the raindrop frame and tablet reconstitution tying the loop. Some beats blur into abstraction (e.g., "retracing cognition" and "equations of her existence") so that tactical stakes occasionally feel vaporous, but orientation (who/where/when) is strong and the pattern pays off. Cost—dissolution into a chosen timeline and loss of individuated self—is legible in the ending images.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: journey to cavern → demonstration of backward song → emotional cracking open → epilogue of new life. Causality is intact, and the piece fits an accumulative/lyric lens where each image of hush and vibration deepens the central drive. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: she finds a way to “feel” music and reframes her deafness. The main limitation is that, once the magical device is introduced, the outcome feels almost preordained, with little doubt or friction en route to that closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clear: followed from the bureau → rooftop escape → courtyard refuge → decision to transmit data, with the quarantine investigation as the underlying thread. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he commits to continuing his risky work in solitude, symbolized by the pigeon’s flight. However, the quarantine zone’s implications remain mostly off-stage, and the cost of his choice is more asserted than dramatized. The structure is linear and coherent but relatively low in decisive change or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clear: she enters with a plan (UV revealing) as the Nightshade’s transformation completes, the scent forces a crisis, backstory memories surface, and her final choice to open the vial resolves the internal drive. Causality is coherent and accumulative: UV reveals link the plant, the vial, and the mentor’s legacy, tightening toward the decisive uncorking. The reflection/memory passages are well-anchored in present stimuli and loop back into present stakes. The closure (a resonant reconfiguration of her role from broker of light to keeper of last breaths) lands with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a single accumulative scene with a clean throughline: arrive in grotto, engage with rope and walls, contemplate options, choose to continue with the rope. Under a textural lens, the piece builds coherently toward a closure where the poet refuses both easy escape and static memorialization in favor of ongoing engagement. Causality is soft but legible—his reflections arise from present stimuli, and the ending reconfigures his relation to time and the rope. The cost of the choice (forfeiting both escape and preservation) is conceptually present but under-dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from world premise → remembering the tradition → assembling the fire → the ritual → outward ripple and conceptual reframing. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure—reconfiguring the hush from absolute void to a charged, hopeful silence—is legible. However, obstacles are minimal; the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without complications, so the sense of earned change is more conceptual than dramaturgically pressured. Still, the before/after in the world’s acoustic state and her stance is clear enough for solid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival, preparation, administration, observation, aftermath and walk back to the city. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the accumulative drive of repeated motifs (static, half-truths, amber light) supports a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than eventful, but the “residue” of emotion in the dealer and the client’s impending morning void are clear. The main weakness is the lack of a real turn or complication once the ritual begins; the arc feels preordained more than strained toward.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: a misdirected envelope leads to investigation, reunion with the locket, and the creation of the Harbor Heart award, culminating in a reconfigured status quo. The piece relies heavily on summary (“Days later…,” the event night compressed into a couple of lines), which flattens what could be pivotal turns and obscures any real cost. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena’s outlook and the harbor’s culture shift—but it lands without friction or complication. The structure is coherent but too neat for elite-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: exclusion → encounter with the girl → shared search → solstice revelation → dedication, with each stage clearly causing the next. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration when Kael grasps Dusk’s tag (“belonging-in-difference”) and chooses to dedicate his sculpture, with the cost—his loneliness and prior failures—felt and reweighted. The crater’s shimmer/solstice functions as a soft time constraint that focuses the climax without contrivance. A hair more foregrounded jeopardy or a concrete risk to the ritual would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: giant’s impending wake → Gasp and time malleability → pendant’s power → quest for the first echo → choice to ring the bell and become the echo. Structure is accumulative but coherent, with the backstory (grandmother, clockmaker) tightly feeding into the present crisis rather than stalling it. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s transformation into the echo reweights the entire premise and exacts a clear cost. A slight distance from moment-to-moment tactical struggle (we’re told she runs across liquid architecture rather than experiencing obstacles) keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads cleanly as an accumulative, ritual-driven scene: each step with the glass eyes and mosaic builds toward the doorway image and conceptual closure about transforming loss. Causality is soft but coherent—the warmth, shifting patterns, and final half-open doorway all follow from her deliberate actions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: loss is redefined as a question and a space that can hold grief. Stakes remain largely interior and abstract, but the structural throughline is solid and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: outage → descent → retrieval and caching → observation and payoff, all in one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored reflection. The inferred drive is Accumulative/Textural: each breadcrumb and sensory association builds toward a quiet reconfiguration in the ending, where an ongoing pattern of connection is established. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s choice to continue caching, now with a specific child reciprocating by reading aloud, crystallizes the “visible in intention” idea with a subtle cost (her continued literal invisibility). A touch more real risk or potential for failure in the middle (e.g., child might miss the clue or be interrupted) would strengthen structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is linear with a clear accumulative drive: storms damage the trellis, she attempts reconstruction, discovers a different approach, and then the narrative widens to show the sustained change. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward control vs. surrender is visibly altered and linked back to the linden leaf and trellis. Causality is soft but intact; each stage follows plausibly from the last under an interior-pressure lens. The main limitation is the low sense of constraint or cost at the end—the path she chooses never feels truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: find brooch → follow rain trails → encounter scavenger and exchange → reflective integration in the studio. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure (sleep, new stance toward island and art) is clearly on the page with a modest but real cost (relinquishing the brooch, accepting change). The pattern of motifs (rain trails, canvas, brooch) is taught early and paid off without confusion. Slight repetitiveness near the end dilutes tightness but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the pilgrim arrives → the cave’s song changes → Lira’s sight falters → unseen forces enter via overlapping shadows → they seek the pearl → she chooses to accept them, restoring a new balance. Closure is on the page via a decisive change (Lira’s choice) and a conceptual repricing of her magic and the cave’s nature. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with escalating manifestations of the same pressure; there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues. The main limitation is that the felt cost of the resolution is conceptually clear but not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: the valve tests through staggered intervals build toward a reconfiguration of exile as composition instead of void, and closure lands cleanly when silences are “transcribed” and the harbor itself is re-understood. Causality within the lyric frame holds: because she has collected spray and because the exile brings the valve, she can map the missing harbors and then reframe his silence. The drive lens is consistent, with one sustained tightening (the seventh interval) that crystallizes stakes. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, but it’s legible in the navigator’s weeping and in the archivist’s permanent, patient vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: appearance of the ticket punch → following the pavement glyphs → opening the door → confronting the fortress and her own unspoken truth. Causality holds and the closure beat—a reconfiguration of what “mapping” means for her—is legible and satisfying. Pressure and obstacles, however, are minimal; once she commits, the world yields rather than contesting her, softening the sense of hard-won change. Still, the through-line is coherent and neatly contained to a single continuous passage.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Lira finds the tile, learns to use it, creates the mural, and the fisherman receives solace, leading to her reframed understanding. The drive lens is predominantly accumulative/textural, with images and motifs (whales, stars, tile) building to a reconfiguration of meaning, and closure is present but low-cost. Causality is intact but soft; there are no real complications or reversals after the tile is discovered. The ending functions as a gentle resonance rather than a decisive transformation of options.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure follows a clean causal arc: solar storm → spatial mutiny → use of amulet and magnetic fields → offered choice → decisive merger and dissolution. Orientation (who, where, when) is established quickly and remains stable despite the high-concept language. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she trades certainty of immortality for unknowable afterlives. The accumulative, lyric progression still reads coherent under a causal/textural hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is solid: timing the director, breaching the office, failing to find letterhead, discovering the ledger and hidden documents, then using the ink pot in a negotiated exchange. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and stance shift: Sam abandons naive fairness in favor of “ethical algebra” with a visible cost to their self-concept. The photocopied ledger as off-page leverage is smart but under-dramatized, making the director’s swift concession feel slightly convenient for such high stakes. Structure is otherwise clean, with one continuous night and no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: ritual at dawn → intensifying hum and mapping → codex swelling → hum fading as day arrives, with closure in the lamp’s dimming and the notepad resting as guardian. Causality is soft but consistent—each described act earns the next within the ritual logic. Closure reads as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she continues the ritual in a reweighted silence, bearing the cost of isolation. The only ceiling here is that the on-page cost and before/after reconfiguration remain subtle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: fragments of others’ stories build toward the discovery of the poison label, the added whisper about a vanished brother, and the culminating act of placing the box at the tide. Causality is subtle but present—each new shard reweights his understanding of erasure until the box becomes a “mass of un-erased existence.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: being declared dead is reframed as a forced translation into a story-based mode of existence, with the box as proof. The piece could gain slightly from one sharper mid-story hinge, but as a lyric mosaic it holds together and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: each beat (cello hum, seashell, compass, myth retelling) layers toward the conceptual repricing at the end, where the riddle becomes about the reader and Elias’s role reconfigures. Causality is soft but legible—his speaking alters the hum and shell, leading to the cracking/compass release and identity shift. Orientation (who/where/what he’s doing) is solid early, and the observatory frame holds throughout. The closure has a clear before/after in stance, though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: looming privatization → Mira’s need to reorganize → graffiti-coded meetings and resource-sharing → storm test → corporate arrival with secrets intact, yielding a Charged Poise ending. Orientation (who/where/what’s at stake) is established swiftly and never lost. Escalation is structurally present (multiple murals, storm, then arrival), but opposition remains soft; the corporation’s presence feels more atmospheric than actively constraining tactics in-scene. Closure lands conceptually, but the battle never tightens to a genuinely difficult hinge moment for Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: ascent → setup (camera/hourglass/chemicals) → grain falls → flare → photo → sunrise and loss. Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she achieves the goal (captures the image) while losing the object (the bloom) on the page. The temporal pressure of dawn and finite air is signaled and paid off, even if never pushed into genuine crisis. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with no major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: damaged drone arrives, Miren diagnoses via refraction, repairs before the cartographer’s arrival, and then recontextualizes her craft for Kael. Time and space are clearly anchored early (rail depot, night, ship’s maiden voyage approaching dawn), and the story sustains one coherent through-line. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Miren’s explanation to Kael conceptually reprices “navigation” and “seeing” with a quiet, earned cost. Escalation is modest, with limited sense that failure would carry more than professional stakes, which slightly blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: outpost → falcon’s return → condensation pattern insight → alignment of feather/map → walk onto ice → becoming the singular convergence. Causality holds within a lightly mythic logic, and the closure—a decisive change as Kael becomes the source itself—is legible with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the “cost” of leaving the outpost life and entering the rivers remains more conceptual than felt; we’re told the maps will be redrawn and crews will find him gone, but the loss doesn’t bite deeply on the page. Still, patterning around the falcon, condensation, and convergence pays off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: long setup of role and method, then the present ritual under the archway that initiates the town’s subtle reconstruction. Causality under the textural lens is coherent—hum → tuning fork → footsteps → resonance → architectural realignment—with no major orientation or rule breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the arch moves from “humming with death” to “wild hush of possibility,” and the town’s fate line shifts from imminent collapse to plausible endurance at a conceptual cost of centuries more labor. The only limitation is that the pressure contour is smooth rather than sharply tightening, which keeps it just below top-tier structural tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: time pressure and dwindling oxygen push Lira deeper, the vial enables her to resolve the temple’s knot, which in turn allows access to the core and necessitates her final sacrifice. The structure—main underwater scene plus brief surface epilogue—lands closure with both a decisive change (her death and data transmission) and a conceptual repricing (silence as enduring artifact). Stakes are introduced early (rescue window, oxygen, mission) and paid off explicitly. A few world-rule elements (how exactly “gathered hush” pins the core) remain poetically loose but don’t break coherence under a lightly speculative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: lighthouse → discovery of lattice → hidden door → descent → ritual → departure, with each step legible and linked. The drive lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: causal moves exist but the real escalation is in symbolic density and hush/copperlight motifs. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s story is absorbed into the prison, and the lighthouse becomes the custodian of hush at a conceptual cost (he vanishes from the world’s narrative). The live clock (“before they find the bodies”) is underused and opposition never materializes, muting the sense of concrete risk.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost appears → presents bead and condition → Elara carries it to the tree → placement triggers transformation and repays the debt. The piece lands solid closure via Decisive Change: the orchard is revived, the bead fuses to the roots, and the ghost departs with cost (her dissolution and Elara’s inherited grief). Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation issues and one clear escalation (the humming, trembling greenhouse). The main limitation is that the path has minimal complication or reversal, so the arc feels a bit too smooth for elite short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: decline of the wharf → sleepwalking and footprint patterns → tapestry-map → discovery of the alcove → communal revaluation of ruin. The accumulative, almost fable-like structure fits the lyric mode, and closure lands as a real reconfiguration for Elara and the village. Still, the journey through the labyrinth lacks complication or real jeopardy, so escalation feels smooth rather than pressurized. The piece reads as structurally sound but somewhat too easy in its central quest.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → excavation → discovery of the broken sundial → purposeful wandering → finding the wedge → restoration → reframed relationship to home and past. Causality is modest but coherent (her decision to rebuild prompts the wandering that leads to discovery), and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration of her stance toward history and exile. Stakes remain mostly internal and contemplative, with no meaningful external complication, which keeps the pressure low for an elite market. Still, as an accumulative/lyric piece, it lands its final beat clearly and without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene, a clear goal (encode and dispatch the letter before systems close), and a closure that reweights the analog/digital stakes. Causality is simple but solid—Kael decodes, encodes, hands off, and reflects—without teleports or rule breaches. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (“The future would forget, but the margins would remember”) that conceptually prices the choice to stay analog. The main limitation is that the deadline never meaningfully complicates tactics, so narrative pressure stays low even as the thematic fabric deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a lyric accumulation from listening/embroidering → discovery of the coup prophecy → decision to act, all under a single, continuous scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each added detail (flame language, stitching, hidden star) deepens knowledge until the prophecy line forces a stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira steps into the corridor with a defined mission and a narrowed field of options, with the cost implied in leaving sanctuary. The off-stage conspiracy keeps the piece from feeling fully maximized in dramatized stakes, but structurally it works well.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single ritual sequence with a clear before/after: the narrator arrives burdened by unsent letters and leaves having spoken the apology and released them. Causality is strong for a lyric piece—arrival → ritual with shard → evocation of sister/storm → time-limited healing → decision and release—with no orientation issues. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the relationship to the apology and the sister’s memory is reweighted, and the shard’s ongoing presence signals a lasting but partial shift. The cost (limited-time healing, letting go of letters) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—hospital anesthesia frame interleaved with Honiara, Malaita, and Minneapolis memories—stays coherent and pays off as a single liminal scene. Orientation is clear early (hospital, anesthetic, gurney, cast), and the story holds an accumulative/textural drive lens throughout. Closure lands when the decrypted cast message reweights his past choices and present fear into a charged, before/after understanding: his daughter also kept the connection. Stakes are internal but legible, and the final image carries conceptual and emotional cost without resorting to mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: dissatisfaction with her work leads Lyra to the orchard, to the fresco, to using the film, to recreating and displaying the image, and finally to a reconfigured relationship with joy. The structure is essentially one continuous arc with a small time jump to the aftermath, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decisive turn, which fits the accumulative/lyric drive. Closure is solid: she begins hollowed-out and ends with a renewed, outward-facing commitment to “weave more such threads,” with the fog and orchard reweighted. Stakes stay modest and internal, but they are coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: coin → first awakening → mirrors → question/visitor → second layer/text → laugh/next awakening, with closure as a conceptual repricing of “restoration.” Causality is mostly coherent on its own magical terms, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays intact. Still, the pressure on Elena never truly narrows her options, and the events can blur into a series of similar “awakenings” that risk feeling like variations on one move rather than a tightening sequence. The final turn with the visitor’s laugh glows but could land harder if a concrete dilemma had been more clearly set up and then reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: seed arrival → coded exchange with Chen → planting/activation → auditors’ intrusion → detectors confounded by greenhouse chaos → auditors leave, resistance strengthened. Orientation is excellent from the outset and the scene maintains a tight situational lens with a clear present-time line. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate danger is survived and the conceptual stakes reweighted by the image of citywide vines bearing a language of rebellion, though the personal risk for Aris does not appreciably worsen. The one structural limitation is that the auditors’ confusion feels a bit easy, with no lingering twist in their tactics or knowledge to darken the “after” state.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    The piece works as an accumulative/lyric structure: repeated images (blossoms, lullabies, postcard) build toward a resonant reconfiguration where her ongoing song is framed as a lasting armistice. Causality is broadly coherent—she sings, merfolk soften, peace blooms—and the closure image of a “cathedral of peace” with sustained lullabies lands. Still, turns are mostly declarative and generalized (“Across centuries…”), with minimal specific beats of resistance or setback, which flattens the sense of cost. The war’s “echo” is mentioned but not structurally tested against a concrete new threat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure reads as accumulative/textural: discovery of the resonance, experimentation with the song, and the decision to continue form a coherent progression. Causality is simple but intact—because she hums, the orchids awaken; because awakening reveals irretrievable loss, she reframes her task as defiant preservation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final stance embraces ongoing, costly, partial resistance against oblivion. The piece risks some sameness of beat (lighting orchids / preserving echoes), but the before/after in her understanding is legible and thematically weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery → quarrel and silence → looming archive sealing → risky Jorvik promises → Kess’s reply → reconciliation before closure. The ticking-clock structure (37 hours, then 20 hours of waiting, then 6 hours left) provides clear temporal scaffolding and keeps the drive coherent. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the relationship’s state is materially different and their future options are reweighted by their new shared lexicon, with the cost of accepting vulnerability and divergence. A minor limitation is that the bureaucratic “sealed archive” threat never quite escalates on-page beyond framing pressure; the actual risk of failure is mostly emotional rather than dramatized through obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: maintenance → discovery of chain and envelope → decoding via adhesive → blueprint insight → council persuasion → construction and reconfigured amphitheater. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the amphitheater and community now embody a new harmony between preservation and progress, with the final “shared heartbeat” image reweighting the whole piece. The main weakness is that the council’s resistance and the risk of failure are dispatched quickly, so the decisive vote and subsequent construction feel slightly frictionless. Nonetheless, the drive lens (causal with lyric shading) holds consistently and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: one continuous attic scene with recollection threaded through, oriented cleanly in space and time from the opening. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s final release of the pigeon and quiet acceptance of a “reborn” self—rather than a decisive causal turn, but it lands. That said, escalation is more a gentle thickening of motifs than a clear tightening of options, so the before/after divide is emotionally legible but not sharply stressed. Causality never breaks, but the story leans heavily on repetition instead of structural development.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric progression: analyzing grain → decoding distances → crossing thresholds → conceptual understanding, with a coherent before/after realization about sacred distances. Causality is soft but present (intuition and counting steps lead to doors opening), and the pattern is taught early and maintained. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing of “necessary distances,” but cost is minimal and pressure never tightens beyond mild wonder. Structurally sound and legible, but not yet at a high-stakes, publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival with a clock, progressive descent via the feather’s projections, discovery of the city’s truth, and a final choice to stay and transform. Causality is coherent (feather → exploration → revelation → decision), and the oxygen/sunrise deadline frames the arc effectively. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/transformative choice with clear cost (forsaking the sub and surface life). The only minor limitation is that the path to the decision feels almost too frictionless, with no real counter-pressure besides the AI’s warning.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: missing paths → shard clue → conjecture about geode → descent and seed-planting → retrieval of shards → conceptual revelation about the sea’s memory → tide-pool reprise. Closure functions as a solid conceptual repricing: she reinterprets “disappearance” as transformation and reclamation by the sea, and the final image of footprints “nowhere and everywhere” makes the before/after legible. That said, the “before memory faded” urgency never materially constrains choices, and there’s little sense that options narrow or risk grows beyond the initial premise. Structurally it’s sound and publishable, but the pressure curve is gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure—mini set pieces (the boy and cabinet, the couple, Officer Chen) stitched by Ezra’s system—builds cleanly toward the closing repricing of his “magic” when the bishop warms. Causality is clear at every beat: his prior seeding of the quarter, the glint, the mention to Chen’s daughter all pay off without cheats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the story reweights his belief in total control when the piece behaves unpredictably, implying a cost in his worldview and perhaps his sense of self. The main limitation is that the “cost” remains conceptual and subtle, never quite forcing Ezra into a visible dilemma or change of tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric causal spine: moonstone dust → spontaneous anchoring → voluntary exile and inscription → release → public dance as rebellion, which yields a clear before/after. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—Lyra becomes a living poem bearing forbidden memory with a conceptual cost under the nostalgia ban. However, many beats are summarized rather than dramatized, which mutes the sense of concrete turning points and lived consequence. The structure is coherent and satisfying, but not yet taut enough for top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: harbor → pond/communion → return and application, with a clear accumulative/lyric drive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he reframes his work and then teaches others from that new stance. Still, the “before everything shifts” frame never manifests as a concrete external turn, so the implied clock never truly tightens the scene. The causal chain is soft but intact; the main limitation is low on-page cost and relatively static pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a night walk to the ridge, ritualized release, and a decision to reframe her role, all causally anchored in the past fire choice. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she does not erase guilt but changes how she carries it by committing to teach. Orientation is clear from the outset and never drifts, and there is one meaningful tightening when she leaves the box and takes up the “pack frame” of memory. The main limitation is that the middle slightly plateaus in reflective mode before the closing turn, but not enough to break momentum or lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: trial balloons → puzzling data → equinox anomaly → mandala-construction → coefficient discovery → recalibration and distributed self-sustaining hope. Causality within the conceit is internally tight, and closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing: hope as resonant amplification rather than constant. The cost is hinted—“every revitalization was temporary, requiring constant recalibration against entropy’s patient tide”—but that cost is more stated than felt, which softens the ending’s punch. Still, the before/after of the multiverse’s condition is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—discovery of diaries/negative → development of the image → decision to map and share the corridor’s dream → sending out the report—reads coherent and causally linked under a textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: legacy’s burden is reweighted from shame to directive, with the final message “Remember, but act” clearly marking a before/after. Some late-stage developments (“weeks in the passage,” movement-wide impact) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting the sense of on-page cost at the ending. Still, orientation is clean and the drive lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: arrival → preparation → song → mirrors open → bells close the window → lingering echo in the world, and this holds coherently throughout. Causality is clear within the magic’s rules (song + heartbeat + prisms + hush → opened mirrors; bells → closure and loss), and the repetition of certain beats builds a ritual-like pattern rather than confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is modestly but permanently altered (mirrors “remember,” children unconsciously carry the code), with a clear before/after framed by the bells. The main limitation is that turns are gentle and predictable, without a sharply felt decisive change beyond the expected ending of the window.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single ceremonial scene with past failure feeding into a present attempt at peace, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of who bears the “price of redemption.” Causality is intact (planets → ritual → shared touch → hum → signatures → new stance), and closure lands clearly. However, almost all obstacles (the generals’ skepticism, the war’s longevity) are referenced rather than dramatized, so the central beat sequence lacks a concrete test or serious risk of failure. The drive lens reads as mostly Accumulative with some Causal, and that’s held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: ritual at the salt flat, then zooming outward to the museum and public narrative, then circling back to his private guilt. Causality holds (drought → exposed riverbed → map → hollow → egg release → echo → museum artifact), and the closure image of legend vs buried cost is legible. However, the decisive action occurs mid-piece with the egg drop, while the latter paragraphs largely explain aftermath and reputation, softening structural tautness. Closure is more a conceptual repricing than a turn, and the cost, though present, is mostly offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean and satisfying: discovery of the sanctuary → months of preparation → the night’s dance → unlocking → city’s awakening and immediate consequences. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who, where, what she’s doing, and why), and the backstory of discovery is efficiently tied to present action. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change and a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s mental state, Elara’s social identity, and the sanctuary’s role all shift with visible cost. The one structural limitation is that the actual unlocking proceeds without setback or complication once begun, flattening the sense of risk in the central sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—Adrian arrives, prepares, performs a sequence of reversed stories, and leaves—builds cleanly toward a conceptual reconfiguration of storytelling ethics. Causality is coherent: the puppet shows prompt specific recognitions in the patrons, which shift their trajectories (the trucker and dealer walking out changed, the woman staying to rethink her life). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the meteor/hush image and Adrian seeking “another Dish” frame a before/after in how stories function, with a felt though mostly intellectual cost. It’s strong but not transcendent because external stakes and the risk of failure or backlash remain low and largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: daily signal-building → discovery of the moth wing → creation of the final signal → the monarch’s brief arrival and departure. Cause-and-effect is soft but legible under a textural lens; the moth wing discovery motivates the “final signal,” which in turn seems to attract the lone monarch. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world remains lost, but the pattern of witnessing and signaling is reweighted by the monarch’s passage and the idea of “syntax of absence speaking to ghosts.” The monarch’s appearance is slightly coincidental and symbolic rather than strictly motivated, but it doesn’t break the internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: find card → recognize pattern → test rope → activate memory → re-commit to a new mission. Causality is solid and legible, with the lost wax background and the rope legend paying off in the central activation scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her calling and her relationship to error with visible cost (accepting exile as vocation, relinquishing perfection). The progression is more contemplative than sharply turned, but the single main turn is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: storm → ritual → dream → conceptual shift → emergence, with a clear before/after in her relationship to the Archive and bunker. Causal links are coherent even in this lyric mode—tonight’s anomalous dream, interpreted through her established method, reconfigures the old directive and prompts her action. Closure lands as a genuine Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing, with the bunker’s collapse mirroring her renunciation. The only limit is that external pressures (storm, structural decay) never quite narrow her options as sharply as they could, so escalation feels more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery → investigation → decoding → activation → conceptual repricing at the end. Causality holds under this lens; each step (“He spent seven nights…”, “At dawn on the tenth day…”, activation in the courtyard) follows from his previous work. Closure is solid: the decisive act of activating the tile leads to its vanishing and a reweighted understanding of devotion as acknowledgment, with the banners unfurling as a charged counterpoint. The main limitation is that most of the “beats” are summarized rather than fully scened, so turns feel more intellectual than pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story holds a clear single-scene structure with a tight causal throughline: sanctuary shifts → pin appears → memory transfer → Elara’s release → Mira resets for the next cycle. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration, with Elara’s dissolution and Mira’s ongoing burden making a legible before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with solid causal underpinnings, and the piece honors that pattern. Some explanatory lines about the “scheme” and grace feel slightly redundant and soften structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story has a clean, legible arc from search → discovery of the sextant → ritual reconstruction → release and transformation of the orchard, with no orientation issues. Causality is straightforward and accumulative: each step grows naturally from the last, and the ending’s Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration is clearly on the page. The main limitation is that the path is almost frictionless—no serious setbacks or questions of failure arise—so structure feels elegant but somewhat undemanding. Still, the closure unit is strong and cohesive under an accumulative/lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is cleanly causal: breach → return to mend → discovery in the bag → application of new understanding (ribbon) → daughter’s arrival and partial reconciliation. The closure is legible as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard and contract are revived in tandem with a reconfigured understanding of vows and teaching. Stakes and outcomes are clear without orientation issues, and the ending image reweights the opening. The main limitation is that the conflict resolves with minimal resistance, so escalation never tightens into a truly hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: nonlinear inheritance → curiosity about the forbidden roots → bathroom insight → activating the shell → communing with the tree → revelation that redefines his role. The structure is essentially one continuous escalation framed by a brief bathroom shard, and the pattern is legible early. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing—the orchard as a memorial garden and Evers as mourner—with an on-page cost in his reconfigured purpose. A small amount of philosophical exposition in the middle slightly slows the structural snap, but it doesn’t harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: diary → cipher realization → warden renegotiation → descent → rescue → access to the library → reconfiguration of the bookstore’s role. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the mountain bookstore’s “unheard symphony” is now partly audible, and the diary is a “complete composition” that reweights the opening image. The main structural weakness is how smoothly obstacles resolve (the warden yields quickly; the labyrinth traversal has no real setback), which limits the sense of earned cost. Still, the story’s drive and ending image cohere strongly under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: rumor → ship → card → hidden passage → garden → realization → decision. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal chain remains legible and satisfies the length and scope. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she reconceives solace and forecloses the option of immediate departure, with the ship’s drift now reweighted. Stakes stay inward and relatively low-key, but there is no causality break or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → investigation through records → clock tower locus → impossible door → rope-chamber → rebraiding → altered reality with only the seal as residue. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: history itself is reconfigured and institutional memory rewritten, with a concrete before/after visible in the maintenance logs and the erased death. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—accepting that her work can literally overwrite lives—but it is plainly on the page. Structure holds together elegantly in a single continuous throughline without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: initial disruption, an attempted fix that partially fails, then deeper alignment that produces a more durable hush. Causality is clean (stone → sphere → realization about cracks → humming and alignment), and the ending provides a clear resonant reconfiguration in which Lira is poised for future storms. However, the resolution comes relatively smoothly once she recalls the “ancient technique,” with limited sense of risk or potential failure, softening the impact of closure. The drive lens reads primarily as Accumulative/Textural and is held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the flaw → investigation via retrocognition → deciphering the astronomer’s design → waiting for the right conjunction → aligning the shard and rekindling the beacon → travelers responding. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the accumulative rhythm of visions and present action coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is solid: the beacon is rekindled and her understanding of coincidence reweights the entire narrative, with the travelers’ convergence sealing the pattern. What holds this below the very top band is the relative ease of success—there’s little sense that failure is a live possibility structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure—observatory → forecourt → observatory with the moss journal—reads cleanly, and causality is clear under a textural lens (each space adds pressure and insight). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she moves from trying to sculpt identity out of fixed fragments to grounding herself in the “spaces where experience dissolved into meaning,” with dawn and melting fog underscoring the cost of solidifying memory. Orientation is strong from the opening and never in doubt. The only limit is that stakes and turns are almost entirely internal, so escalation feels like deepening meditation rather than a sharp hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → listening and discovery of the mosaic → ignition of the fire → aftermath and onward journey, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress and its hidden inhabitants move from despair to charged possibility, and Cinder chooses to continue the pattern. Cost is present but light—she spends the rag knot and accepts the endless road, yet nothing seriously resists her on-page. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays coherent, though the lack of concrete obstacles keeps the plot from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative/textural: one continuous pause in a conversation, deepened through recurrent images (tide, cicada, stars) until a quiet reconfiguration of the sibling bond. Causality is soft but coherent: her attentional shift → foresight of his leaving → reframing of transition → his acceptance and promise to return → her emotional loosening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she accepts his departure while recognizing enduring anchors). The piece avoids major orientation issues and sticks to one drive lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is accumulative and legible: bunker → discovery of the doll → rule of “limiting exposure” → world-rule of gravity inversion → ascent to the trellis → return and reframed understanding. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new silence complicates the core pattern and leads to the conceptual closure where the bunker becomes a curated “garden of hush.” The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration with some implied cost (she remains bound to an underground life even as she reframes it). The main weakness is that gravity inversion and the trellis arrive as large, whimsical rules without much prior pressure, so they read slightly more like a new vignette than a tight escalation of an initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single transit framed by the whistle’s echo and the docking, with an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds as silence deepens and the diplomat’s anxiety resolves. Causality is solid—Kael’s deliberate adjustments and use of the terrace’s rotation lead to his physiological and emotional calming, culminating in the transfer of the vial. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he leaves changed, now carrying silence as a resource), with the cost being her relinquishing the heirloom tool of her craft. Stakes stay modest but coherent, and the before/after is legible without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: archives’ warning → journey → murals as coordinates → observatory murals → stairway → throne choice, with the sunrise deadline providing structural pressure and closure. The ending delivers a clean conceptual reconfiguration (prepare, don’t claim, the throne) with on-page cost (she loses the shard, the chronoshawl, and any chance to be heir). Escalation is mostly smooth rather than sharply turned, but the throughline never breaks, and the final image clearly marks a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene: his arrival, their reconnection, the sanctuary’s subtle transformation, his departure, and the implied continuation with new seekers. Causality is soft but legible (his arrival prompts her to re-engage with thresholds, leading to the charged final image), and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration of what the sanctuary is. Stakes and costs remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete dilemmas. Nonetheless, orientation and the core before/after (prison of emptiness → vessel for healing) are clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: glitchy messages → discovery of bolt → theory of pressure → clandestine reprogramming → timed peak → diamonds and silence of texts. Closure is decisive and legible: the experiment succeeds, the community benefits, the texts stop, and Kael’s understanding of “promise” is reweighted. The drive lens reads chiefly as causal with a conceptual overlay, and it holds without contradiction. The one notable gap is cost: consequences are almost entirely positive, so the sense of risk never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent arc: search → activation of gramophone → revelation → reorientation of purpose. Causality is clear enough (“He turned again…The air thickened…Hidden frequencies emerged…In that crest, he saw…”), and the accumulative/textural drive lens holds through to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure is present and legible: he enters intending to end a dynasty and leaves having accepted the role of remembering it. The main weakness is that the revelation feels almost too frictionless, with little sense of risk that could complicate the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: discovery of the door → revelation of the marionette program as map → unsnapping patterns → reality shifts → doorway and allegiance → Aldric’s passage and reconfiguration as guardian. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Aldric’s role and the orchard’s function are permanently altered with a conceptual cost (he is bound to the endless night and its possibilities). The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component, and the ending honors that; the main limitation is that cost remains more implied than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and linear: discover button → research → contact Marcus → receive daughter’s reply, with each step causally linked. The piece is mostly told in summary rather than dramatized scene, but the accumulative, reflective mode is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marianne’s work proves capable of altering a descendant’s sense of origin, easing her own grief. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical, and while that fits the mode, the lack of on-page obstacles or resistance keeps the structural stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: System erases histories → Mara seeks backup → security blocks her → puddle-map leads to lagoon → key opens relay → drone forces sacrifice → reappearance and dissemination. The structure (mission to lagoon + three-days-later coda) is legible, and closure is decisive with a clear before/after in the world. However, the phone key’s magical interface with the lagoon and the puddle-map method both arrive as new rules that conveniently solve blocked paths, edging toward deus ex. These devices are charming enough not to break the story, but they do blunt the sense of hard-won problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows one continuous ritual: arrive → play → hush prophecy → leave, with a legible before/after (prophecy active vs. dissolved). Under an accumulative/textural lens, repetition of motifs (dew, prism, hush) builds toward a quiet closure image. However, the cost of success and the consequences of failure remain abstract, so the decisive change feels more conceptual than dramatically earned. Causality holds, but the structure risks feeling like a static prose-poem rather than a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: moonstone dust → transformed seeds → map → journey to First Seed → arbor reborn, and the story closes decisively on that fulfilled prophecy. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with a lyric, accumulative surface, and the before/after (ashen arbor vs. blooming, voiced arbor) is legible. However, the “before the next hush falls” constraint never becomes an active source of pressure, and Lira faces no substantive obstacles. The closure has conceptual weight but only a light sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: pattern of clocks → compass connection → greenhouse pull → drain → heart-clock → improvisational fix → reconfigured stance on time. Structure is linear with one clear escalation and a solid closure beat that reweights everything before it. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than situationally harsh, but it is legible on the page. A single additional complication or failed attempt in the heart-clock scene might have deepened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the foundry, anchored early, with the coin ritual as the central progression. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: prior failure → decision to attempt redemption via coin → intensifying ritual → conceptual shift and renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the realization about names and her choice to stop searching—carrying the cost of accepting the boy’s irretrievable absence. Stakes remain internal and conceptual but are sufficiently tightened by the ritual’s escalation and the final walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with embedded backstory, clear orientation (Kael in Echo Gorge at hidden sunrise), and causal linkage from harp-playing to spectral confessions to the climactic encounter with the fractured laughter. Closure lands as a strong conceptual reconfiguration (healing as integration rather than restoration) with visible emotional cost. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal chain never breaks or becomes confusing. The only thing keeping it out of the 9s is that escalation is steady rather than sharply tightening around a concrete, time-pressured test.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: a single scene interwoven with memory, where each exposure to UV deepens her understanding until the final conceptual repricing (“mercy… to be lived”). Causality is soft but coherent—light triggers memory, memory reconfigures thinking—and the before/after is clear. Structural variety is limited, with much of the middle circling similar beats (UV → pain → memory → abstraction). Closure lands, but the path there feels more like a sustained plateau than a shaped arc.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: fragment → painting → hidden journal → realization → decision, with each step logically arising from the previous one. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, what the market is) and never wobbles despite the lyrical mode. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator moves from trading other people’s histories to actively keeping and carrying one, with the fragment’s role reweighted. The main limitation is that the path is relatively smooth, with little complication or resistance to deepen the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from malfunctioning light to ghostly manifestation to discovery and then to a reweighted exit. Causality is strong under a mostly accumulative lens—the lights die, the dust pattern cues attention upward, the mainspring amplifies the ghosts, and the cache of barrels reframes the haunt as testimony. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marlon’s role shifts from fixer to permanent witness with an ongoing psychic cost. The only thing keeping it from a higher band is that the escalation feels relatively safe and observational, with no moment where options dramatically narrow beyond the ethical realization.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story’s structure is clean: frost pattern → decision to print → activation of the whisper → projection → destabilization → rupture/merger → new order, with clear causal links inside an accumulative, lyrical frame. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the libraries merge, the system of reality reconfigures, and Elara achieves her project at the cost of the library’s prior equilibrium and her private ownership of the moment. Stakes around the library’s “perfect system” and the sanctuary from a negotiable world are paid off in the destabilization and transformation. A slightly sharper articulation of what Elara concretely risks (beyond the abstract system) at the moment of choice would move this toward the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: dispute → plan to use storm → ritual at the mirror → revelation and altered stance. The drive reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric texture, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dispute ends in silence and the mirror becomes a poem. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than situational—Kael gains truth while accepting slowness and partiality—which fits the mode but keeps tension moderate. The temporal rules are impressionistic but consistent enough not to break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the box and stone arrive, he chooses to repair under a deadline, doubt triggers a setback, truth restores progress, leading to the music’s release and dawn’s return. The ticking clock (chimes toward midnight) and the covenant’s reactive rust provide persistent constraints that shape tactics rather than mere decoration. Closure is decisive and on-page: curse broken, dawn restored, his purpose reconfigured. The main limitation is that the path feels somewhat pre-ordained, with no serious possibility of failure once the pattern of “truth beats rust” is established.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: factory shutdown → discovery of compass → psychometric vision → deliberate preparation → descent → lagoon ritual → refusal to cross the threshold. The story uses an accumulative/textural lens, but each move still follows a clear because/therefore logic. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: she forecloses the path of joining the expedition, accepts a keeper role, and leaves with emptied tools and reweighted purpose. The only limitation is that the on-page cost and risk feel more contemplative than acute, which slightly softens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: GPS failure → journey to the archway → revelation via the slide → carving/placement of the token → conceptual closure about lineage and alliance. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the layering of motifs (wind, wood, stone, light) builds coherently toward a Conceptual Repricing of her role. Causality is soft but consistent—each new perception logically opens the next layer—and the final act of placing the token gives a tangible hinge into the new understanding. The main limitation is that the cost of this closure is more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine (postcards → cathedral story → journey → dawn-glass revelation → transformed mural practice) is clean and legible, and the accumulative structure of vignettes holds together. Closure lands in a quiet but coherent way: her understanding of darkness and night-blooming flowers is reweighted, and she returns with a new artistic stance. The cost is implied (time, effort, surrendering to a non-verbal answer) but not strongly dramatized, which blunts impact at elite-publication standard. Nonetheless, there is a clear before/after in her relation to darkness and to her art.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the letters and diary → retrocognitive trap and decoding via beach debris → political pressure → parley → joint disclosure and release from haunting. The piece manages a compressed mosaic structure while maintaining a coherent throughline and a clear before/after at the end (truth classified vs. broadcast). Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration when she wins partial declassification and her reverie quiets. The only structural softness is that the decoding labor and its obstacles are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, blunting some mid-story pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from solitude and stasis to ritual, incantation, and a reconfigured status quo with settlers arriving. The closure—a conceptual repricing where the sealed bottle shifts from potential solution to permanent, inspiring constraint—is legible and on the page. Causality is somewhat soft: the appearance of the bottle is unexplained and settlers arrive via rumor, with little sense of concrete obstacles or trade-offs along the way. Still, the before/after (desolate cove to scaffolded, memory-lit community) is clear and earned within this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: foghorn → memory/phonograph → accidental prophecy → reinterpretation via water → archival act in the vault, all within one continuous, legible scene. The accumulative/textural drive holds, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reclassified from doom to emotional map, archived at a cost of lingering disquiet. Stakes and turns are more contemplative than dynamic, but there is one meaningful reweighting of knowledge that justifies the ending. No major orientation or lens issues arise, and the structure feels complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a coherent causal arc: egg hatches → ritual to reopen vortex → visions of futures → commitment to sustaining the cycle → thaw and renewal. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a central ritual and a clear closure beat as she returns with new understanding and a sustained vortex. However, the cost of failure (ice claiming everything) is shown only in vision and never pressures the present action beyond a soft deadline, so closure lacks bite. The ending reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn with strong on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous situation framed around “zero hour,” with clear causal steps from rope constraint to instrument readings to the non-alarm resolution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses the path of sounding the alarm, and the log entry plus journal realization reconfigure “warning” as silence. Causality and orientation are never in doubt, and the storm’s turn is motivated via the microclimate data. The only minor weakness is some thematic restatement in the final paragraphs that slightly softens the sharpness of the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is accumulative: the glass discovery, first alignment with the sky, the garden’s growth, and the later explorers build a clear before/after. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—Sola reconceives the “overlooked era” as a cocoon and commits to tending the station as sanctuary, with the final image of the lantern glass in the window. Causality is soft but coherent under the lyric lens; each step plausibly grows from the previous one. The main weakness is the lack of a sharp turning point or explicitly priced choice—the arc feels more like gentle blossoming than a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/lyric structure: images and motifs (box, bees, covenant, ghosts) build toward a quiet reconfiguration where Elara accepts guardianship and a future task. Causality is soft but coherent: discovery of the box and revelation that the bees are dying lead to her vow. Closure lands, but the cost and consequences of her decision are understated and largely conceptual. Repetition of similar sentences and ideas dilutes a sense of progression and makes the midsection feel plateaued rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—urn fragment → timelessness → garage-sale outreach → paradoxical meeting → reframed understanding—reads coherent and purposeful, with clean anchors in who/where/when. Closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing: Elara’s stance toward time and her role in the Silo’s purpose reconfigure with discernible before/after. The main soft spot is the relative ease of the middle turn (one cryptic online reply neatly leads to the climactic meeting), which trims some sense of earned difficulty without breaking the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: one continuous shoreline window where images and reflections build toward a conceptual reconfiguration around incompleteness. Causality is light but coherent—the snapped kite, the feather, and the storm’s aftermath all feed his reflections without contradiction. Closure lands in his reframed stance toward his work and life, but the before/after line is gentle and carries little sense of real consequence. Structurally it’s stable and legible, yet the arc is more circular than evolving, limiting impact at a top-tier standard.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure follows a clear causal spine—diagnosis → diary → discovery → construction → completion/translation—overlaid with an accumulative, ritual rhythm that teaches us how the orchard works as it awakens. Time and progress are tracked concretely through wire spools and quadrants, giving the build a satisfying inevitability. Closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing: death is not averted but redefined as translation into the temple’s architecture, with on-page cost (no body, no conventional legacy). The shift to the new caretaker’s perspective seals the before/after without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: follow footprints → reach tower → analyze → realize → descend with new resolve, all under a single, coherent lens. Causal flow is intact and legible, with no orientation debt and a clear before/after in her understanding of “homecoming.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/RR—the pilgrimage and her own exile are reweighted through the chemistry-of-homecoming insight. However, the plot is almost frictionless, with no meaningful obstacles or reversals to test this arc under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: hearing the submerged concord → experimenting with seeds and song → locating living soil via birds → final planting and garden emergence. Causality is legible within the mythic frame, with each step motivated by the previous discovery and the coachman’s purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield becomes a garden and the reef’s “ghost” is reweighted as living concord, though the cost is more inferred than dramatized. No orientation issues or structural confusion, but the resolution arrives with relative ease, without a hard turn of risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the cylinder → deciphering the riddle → journey across the wasteland → opening the vault and reconfiguring his relationship to loss. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with one main transition (settlement to journey to vault) and a clear before/after anchored in the ending. However, the middle section (the three-day trek) is summarized with minimal complication or concrete obstacles, so escalation feels a bit smoothed over. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration, but the path there is slightly too convenient for the standard you’re targeting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: observation → ritual of sketching → glimpse of new light → alignment with compass → departure into space, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and mild Resonant Reconfiguration: they physically leave the station and reframe their isolation as exploration at some cost of safety. However, escalation is gentle and the causal chain is low-pressure—very little on-page resistance to the plan, and the “window of escape” feels almost too conveniently available. The drive lens (accumulative/situational) is stable but the cost of the shift remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: sky goes wrong → spire calls → labyrinth → chessboard puzzle → heart repair → world mended, with no orientation issues. However, the middle beats read as a smooth treasure-hunt rather than escalating tests—the chess puzzle is solved in one move using pre-taught knowledge, and nothing threatens failure once he enters the spire. Closure is present (the spire is amended, his role redefined), but the victory feels too frictionless relative to the sky-tearing stakes. The lack of a complicating turn or setback keeps the structure from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: Kael enters the whispering gallery with a clear goal, performs the ritual walk, frees the prisoner, then chooses to stay as keeper of memory, giving the piece a coherent accumulative drive. Causality is sound on its own terms—the pattern walk triggers the opening panel; the pawns complete the prisoner’s arc; the closing reframes the interregnum. The main weakness is the lack of complication: the ritual succeeds on the first attempt with no setback or genuine risk, so cost remains largely conceptual. Closure still lands via a conceptual repricing of the interregnum and Kael’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term search → discovery of the night-only alcove → methodical activation of the stone → mountain-wide pulse → reconfigured labyrinth and new understanding of home. Closure is solidly on the page: the labyrinth realigns, the stone is destroyed, Mira gains the language and a new equilibrium with her memories. The hinted stakes of catastrophic “storm” versus balance never manifest as a truly difficult consequence, softening the felt cost of her choice. Structure is otherwise coherent and appropriate to length, with no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → investigation of the tapestry → decoding/winnowing → key → time release → teaching/forgiveness, with no major logic gaps in the magical premise. Closure is solid: the village unfreezes and his choice to teach reframes his exile and guilt with visible emotional cost. The structure is linear and easy to follow, though the puzzle-solving section proceeds without much complication or setback. Overall, it offers a complete, legible arc appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s long-running poetry rebellion leads to Mara’s doubts, which culminate in the glass-and-pigment act that interrupts the ritual and reconfigures community behavior. The structure leans accumulative/textural, but the decisive change—ritual halted, discussions begun—is on the page with clear before/after. Some later outcomes (children at the spire, Elders arguing) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the immediate sense of cost. Still, closure reads as a solid conceptual repricing of the ritual’s “truth” rather than a vague fadeout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine—finish the memory-kintsugi with the scarab before the air fails—is clean and legible beneath the lyricism. Each alignment of the charm with a crater yields a new memory and deepens stakes as the environment degrades (waves, cracked support, mercury spill, failing exchanger). Closure lands on-page: she inhales the corrosive atmosphere and transforms rather than simply dying, with the completed statue and calmed workshop as visible costs and rewards. The structure reads as accumulative with a solid causal thread, and the before/after is unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: cracked mirror → decision to return/seek caves → wrong turn → hidden oasis → painting and renunciation, with a clear before/after at the end. The closure—leaving the seashell and walking out “ready to begin anew”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with tangible emotional cost. Structure is straightforward and coherent, but escalation is very smooth; there are no sharp turns or complications once he finds the oasis. Overall it’s well-shaped but not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean under an accumulative/textural lens: heat breaks → last morning frame → ascent to lantern → ritual with cork and lens → Marcus’s interruption → quiet reconfiguration of their dynamic. Backstory about her mother and the old keepers is anchored to present cues (the cork, the light) and directly informs her tactic in the now. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decision, but it lands on the page with a before/after in how communication works between them. Stakes stay modest in scale yet coherent, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: midnight calls → accumulating technical data → building the resonator under a full-moon deadline → activation and partial reunion. The drive lens reads primarily as causal, with a satisfying closure beat where the bridge functions and his situation reconfigures from desperate search to tenuous connection. Cost is present conceptually—he remains alone, gains only a voice, and the bridge seems temporary—but resistance on the way to success is modest. Still, the structure fits the length and lands a clear before/after without cheats or retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the eye → curse → attempts to suppress/“cure” it → decision to expose it to the community → reframing as tool. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing of truth-as-contagion versus truth-as-healing, with a visible cost in risk and vulnerability. Some pivotal beats (the villagers’ reaction, patrol threat) are summarized rather than staged, softening impact. Still, the structure holds under a causal lens with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the object → memory-reading investigation → reinterpretation → quiet epilogue with the letter and altered status quo. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of the stranger’s gesture as a gift and Cornelius’s role as witness—lands clearly. Causality is modest but coherent; nothing breaks, yet almost nothing truly surprising happens once the premise is laid out. The morning-boat coda reinforces rather than reconfigures stakes, which limits punch.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: chip glimmers → ant map recognized → trail followed → cavern → doorway confronted → step through. The structure fits a single escalating journey with one clear transition from shop to creek to cavern, and the rising water provides a simple but effective ticking clock. Closure is solid: Merrick’s decisive passage through the doorway, abandoning his old life, lands as a real before/after. The only limitation is that complications are relatively straightforward, with no substantial mid-beat reversal beyond discovery and approach.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: climb → grotto encounter → revelation of prior queens → acceptance of sentinel role, with a strong before/after line. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure—becoming the ridge’s guardian and realizing she was “the dreamed”—lands with conceptual and emotional cost. The temporal and spatial anchors (base of mountain to ridge grotto, court below) are clear, and there’s no orientation debt. The only limitation is that the pattern of vision-then-explanation leans slightly expository in the middle, softening some structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: they meet, exchange the shell and ideas, perform an alchemical act, then articulate a new stance about returning differently. Causality is soft but coherent—each step flows logically from the prior one, and the closure is a conceptual repricing of presence as the true treasure. Still, there is almost no genuine constraint or complication; nothing meaningfully resists their intentions. The ending feels like a smooth continuation of the starting premise rather than a hard-won reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence is coherent: grave → cabin/writing → feral nostalgia’s pursuit → aerial confrontation → conceptual acceptance and return. Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing: the self redefined from confused subject to ongoing narrative, with the cost being his own “death” as a stable, linear person (“The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues”). Causality is poetic but traceable—nostalgia’s pressure leads to the flight, which enables the re-seeing of grave and past selves from above, which forces the reframing. The nonlinear time is purposeful rather than confusing, and the ending’s earned stasis/charged poise is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a tight single-scene accumulative arc: Elena enters with a concrete errand and submerged grief, and each beat (the screw, the work on the clock, the oil, the adjusted mechanism) layers meaning toward a conceptual repricing of loss and time. Causality is soft but coherent—her disclosures and his responses clearly lead to the reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands on-page with cost: she does not regain smell, but gains a new stance toward time and sensory translation. Stakes are modestly scaled yet fully resolved for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece runs as a single accumulative ritual scene with clean orientation (Kaelin, floating rock, storm, platform) and a coherent emotional arc. Causality is modest but present: heightened anxiety → ink crystallization → tear alters the rune → emotional release → storm breaking. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her stance toward her scars changes, but the cost is quiet and somewhat underplayed. Structurally it’s sound, yet the journey from set-up to transformed state feels more like an extended beat than a pressured progression.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear spine—Mira arrives with a plan, executes it, and the relationship shifts as the orchard is felled. Causality is coherent (perfume → emotional opening → apology → partial reconnection) and the closure beat—stepping into the orchard as the first tree falls—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the “imperfect miracle” frame is paid off narratively, not just thematically. The only ceiling here is the relatively gentle, foregone nature of the outcome; there’s little sense that reconciliation might truly fail.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: restlessness → spiral arbitration awakens → journey through transforming stacks → confrontation with the whisper → merger with the dictionary and reconfiguration as the new “beginning.” Causality is lyric rather than mechanical, but the because/therefore chain within that mode is legible (her restlessness triggers arbitration; her walking shifts the temple; recognizing the pattern prompts surrender). Closure is strong: she decisively becomes what she observed, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (self as library/universe). There are no orientation issues; the temple-library-in-the-hiccup frame is clear from early on and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: whistle → ascent → key in lock → progressive counting backwards → realization, with each pass tightening the conceptual inquiry. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of time—“clocks do not count what has passed, but what remains”—tied to the key and water imagery. Causality is simple but coherent, with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the decisive change is intellectual rather than dramatically costly, keeping the arc somewhat cool.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: mystery of recurring intrusion → confrontation → reinterpretation → protocol rewrite, all in a single continuous night-to-dawn arc. Causality is coherent and accumulative, with each observational beat tightening into the choice to cross the barriers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “intrusion” is redefined and the security system’s purpose is conceptually repriced with on-page consequences (new protocols, reclassified signature). The only limitation is that the “revolutionize everything” move leans on projection rather than dramatized systemic change.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line from lantern → subway clues → mapped code → secret chamber → reframed life stance is coherent and legible under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. The closure (her decision to turn inherited chaos into responsible teaching) registers as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost. That said, the steps unfold with minimal resistance; each discovery arrives smoothly, so escalation feels more like a calm treasure hunt than pressured problem-solving. All set-ups (lantern, scrawls, father’s lore about a hidden room) do pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—haunted booth and disc → wrong-number suicide calls → realization of a nightly loop → experiment with the disc → decisive breaking of the disc and escape—is clear and satisfying. The loop’s mechanics are sketched rather than rigorously worked out, but the magical-realist logic holds enough to support the closure. The ending offers a decisive change with cost (bloodied palms, irreversible silence, loss of the calls) and a new option (living above ground). Some midsection repetition of “same voice, same plea” feels more told than dramatized, slightly flattening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/lyric structure: discovery of the photo → return to the jetty → writing → communal uptake, with tight causal and thematic linkages. Orientation is clear early (archivist, archive room, then jetty at twilight), and the throughline remains coherent. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act: the private covenant becomes a communal healing practice, and her final reflection reframes prior moments. The cost is subtle—no clear sacrifice beyond emotional vulnerability—so the closure feels gentle rather than sharply consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: rumor economy → realization about the moon rock → staged ritual → epilogue with Elara, and the closure (a reconfigured station infused with communal hope) lands cleanly. Causality is internally consistent—Mira’s plan leads to a rumor cascade, then to an on-page ritual that alters the station’s state. However, many beats are summarized (“Within hours, the improbable rumor chain had transformed...”), which flattens on-page turning points and makes the decisive moments feel more narrated than dramatized. The cost of Mira’s departure and the ghosts’ transformation is conceptually present but under-experienced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: she enters the forest, follows the notes, reaches the stillpoint, undergoes reconfiguration, and returns. Causality is clean at this scale (ring → following trail → stillpoint → inner realization), with no orientation problems. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the “map” redefined as inward geography with cost in the form of fully facing her grief. A touch more resistance in reaching the stillpoint could further sharpen the sense of earned movement, but the arc is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal line is clear: find pen → begin editing → reservoir dwindles → forced selection → acceptance when the pen runs dry. The piece functions on an accumulative/lyric drive, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis—he redefines his role from fixer to “careful editor” of an imperfect manuscript. However, the pivotal phase (active editing and narrowing options) is handled in broad strokes rather than concrete scene turns, which softens the felt cost. Orientation is solid and the lens holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous encounter at the harbor that deepens Elias’s relation to silence and culminates in a reconfigured stance. Causality is clear—her arrival, instruction, and final sign directly lead to his new mode of being and acceptance of ongoing obscurity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the core rule (silence = emptiness) is overturned with cost (his music is “not for the living to hear”). Stakes remain largely internal and contemplative, but they do tighten meaningfully rather than drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal line from rockslide → archive discovery → tapestry revelation → mural-cipher → coordinates → vault is coherent and satisfying, with a clear before/after: Kael’s method of “protecting” knowledge decisively changes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they become the archive’s final librarian, visibly foreclosing their arsonist path with emotional cost. Some turns feel conveniently smoothed (the archive’s sudden appearance, the skylight-angle mechanic working on the first try, no real external obstruction over “weeks”). Still, the accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly, and the ending’s cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story holds a clean causal spine: Kael disables monitoring → shapes the garden through drumming → races the AI’s response → triggers the lagoon’s transformation. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure with a clear ticking clock (drone incoming, hush of the universe) keeps pressure coherent. Closure lands decisively when Kael dissolves into sound and the system logs a “malfunction,” making the before/after legible with cost and irony. A minor limitation is that the rules of the lagoon’s power are largely asserted rather than tested or complicated, leaving escalation somewhat straightforward rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → port paralysis → smuggler’s bet → Marek’s acoustic plan → whisper transmission → watchman alarm → smuggler’s failure, with no serious logic gaps. The closure is solidly causal: Marek proves his thesis and preserves control of the northern corridor, tying external outcome to the initial challenge. Some world mechanics (e.g., whisper encoding via a single struck frequency) are accepted more on concept than fully dramatized logic, but they don’t break the story’s internal rules. The final reflective paragraph clarifies the before/after without undoing the earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the guardian manipulates light, the child approaches, they share the mirror, and the child leaves changed, with a clear before/after in emotional state. Causality is soft but intact under the lyric lens—each beat of light-weaving leads naturally to deeper engagement. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the child now carries the mirror and a new relationship to darkness. However, the lack of a concrete on-page price or sharply defined turning point keeps the structural arc from feeling fully earned at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, mostly linear accumulation: prophecy → classroom pressure → window campaign → grotto gathering → city-wide shift, fitting an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is present but soft; authorities’ non-interference and the city’s rapid, low-friction receptivity feel convenient, reducing tension. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city has quietly changed its stance on authority through thought, not violence. The cost of this choice, however—risk, sacrifice, or loss—is only lightly implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is solid: scrimshaw discovery → whale’s call → compulsion to unmoor → encounter with the disappearing island and its guardian → unlocked hearts and self-redefinition. The structure is cleanly single-arc with one meaningful turning point at the guardian’s touch and an earned closure when Mira chooses the liminal life. The magical object works conveniently but not incoherently; cost (leaving her old life) is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, returning to turbines, hush, whittling, and narration to build pressure, and closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (the hush as canvas for survival). Causality is simple but coherent: mandate → mask/void → secret carving/narration → dog encounter → reaffirmed quiet resistance. The dog’s arrival offers a potential turning point, yet its consequences are mostly gestured at (“In the morning, the performer would report…”) rather than structurally tightening options on the page. The arc reads more as deepened stasis than decisive change, but the before/after in understanding is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: ban lifted → atrium → contact with quartz → crossing the lake → final verse and walk into the night, with a clear before/after shift in her relation to boundaries. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the ban as a scar and her movement as entry into “the infinite.” Still, stakes remain conceptual and there’s little concrete resistance or consequence to any step she takes, so the cost of this transformation is muted. The repetition of similar beats (touching, humming, dissolving boundaries) risks a sense of lateral motion rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal for a lyric piece: Elara arrives with a goal, demonstrates her plant-music, proposes a trade, and both characters shift their artistic approach. Closure as a resonant reconfiguration is solid—the before/after of Dorian’s attitude toward imperfection and Elara’s felt “sight” is clear. However, almost every move lands on the first attempt with minimal complication, and the hesitation before the barter is too brief to register as true structural pressure. The phoenix frame bookends nicely but doesn’t materially tighten decisions or options.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: lab reactivation → experiment setup → Mara’s challenge → deliberate introduction of flaw → conceptual realization. Causality holds at the scale intended—her questioning leads logically to adjusting the lens and that action reconfigures what “artificial pilgrimage” means. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (the implied loss of certainty and of frictionless simulation) made legible in the final golden-shadow image. Stakes remain mostly intellectual/emotional, but they are coherent and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative lyric arc: rock bottom → timeless observatory work → appearance of stencil → project with Mnemosyne → time-loop reveal with the traveler. Causality is coherent within the story’s metaphysics, and the closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing where “rock bottom” becomes foundation and grief is reconfigured. The loop of future self sending the stencil back, and the final injunction to “Teach the next withering thing,” provide legible before/after stakes with conceptual cost. Some turns (e.g., three eternities passing, the systemic effect on travelers) are briskly summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene where the reading, rain, and tools build toward a conceptual reconfiguration of “future as chain” to “future as web.” Orientation is clean early—who, where, and the post-crash frame are all clear—and the reflective material consistently ties back to present action. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the architect’s request to “build again” and Mara’s grid of futures reweight everything that came before. The arc is more intellectual than dramatic, but there is a clear before/after in how the future and his role in it are understood.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: she searches, finds the pagoda at twilight, engages with it, purifies memories, then chooses to stop and leave, with a clear before/after reconfiguration. The accumulative drive (building atmosphere and ritual until a charged climax) holds consistently, and orientation is solid from the opening. Causality is intact, but pressure remains relatively low; the danger of patterns and “forbidden” knowledge is mostly asserted rather than tested on the page. The closure—her earned stasis in accepting the burden and method—is legible, if somewhat conceptually neat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine (noticing the shadow → studying decades of footage → realizing the stone’s role → binding/transfiguring the shadow) is clean and legible, with a clear before/after. Orientation is strong: we know who she is, where she is, and what the archive task entails early. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow becomes a guardian and her role shifts to a keeper of regret. The main limitation is that pressure is mostly told as potential catastrophe rather than tested in concrete, escalating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean and causal under a quiet, situational lens: in the aftermath of the con’s exposure, she moves from stunned shame into purposeful reconstruction, step by step. The burning of brochures, the re-treatment of the tail, the rediscovered notebook, and the drafting of the new mission statement all build toward the decisive choice to tell the truth and accept legal and public consequences. Closure is a resonant charged poise: the officer’s arrival and her prepared stance mark a clear before/after with visible cost. The design is linear and relatively low in overt reversals, but for this length and mode it achieves a satisfying, legible arc without dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean causal thread—coffee rings and plant telepathy lead to the tapestry, tunnel, pool, miracle, and then back to the room. Structure is linear and legible, with a clear before/after: she gains the ability to read scars and internalizes the miracle. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of scars and time, but the lack of obstacles or reversals keeps the arc relatively flat. The accumulative, lyric drive is coherent, yet the journey feels more like a guided tour than a pressured progression.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the film → psychometric reading → incubation → revelation that the Rialto is a storage architecture → transfer of love into Mira → departure. Causality within the lyric frame holds and the closure (Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis) is legible: the building’s soul migrates into her at real cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is taught early and maintained; the demolition deadline adds a faint situational clock without over-complicating. One could argue the incubation step is somewhat hand-waved mechanically, but it doesn’t break the internal logic or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine—blocked artist → finds sextant → journeys north → ritual under aurora → rest/dream → unblocked—is coherent and easy to follow. The accumulative, lyric drive is held consistently, and the ending does deliver a clear before/after shift in her creative state. The “cost” of the journey and ritual is more stated than felt; nothing seriously resists or complicates her path. Still, the closure beat (returning home to write with new confidence) lands cleanly under the established lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: waking with the frozen clock → detecting the null-zone → attempting quantum “braiding” → relocating and planting the archive → becoming part of the charm. Causality is clear within the lyric frame, and the closure—guard dissolving into the lullaby as the archive finds a new rooting site—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with evident cost. Stakes tighten via the spreading “cancer of nothing” and the discovery of an unburned corner beneath the dune. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings) holds consistently to the “midnight becomes a place” ending.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: waking/biome shards build toward the realization that the forest is her mind and she becomes its architect, a clear conceptual reconfiguration with a before/after. Causality works under a textural lens—each new biome and insight arises from the previous hum/listening, and the gear’s turning escalates toward the climax. The closure has cost in the relinquishing of old, purely logical identity, though this is mostly asserted rather than dramatized. Overall structure is elegant but prioritizes idea-flow over concrete, consequence-laden turns.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: leash breaks → dog lost → ridgeway → ferry → crossing and reflection → renewed traverse → reunion and reconfiguration around courage. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one coherent drive and a clear before/after at the end. However, key turns (the appearance of the ferry, the dog conveniently waiting in the cove) lean on benevolent coincidence rather than Lin’s difficult decisions, which softens the sense of earned consequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but with relatively low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: past ignored warning → catastrophic accident → ongoing penance → new warning sign → choice to act differently. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli (stairs, bolt, stain) and consistently tilts the current decision rather than stalling it. Closure is a decisive change—she reports and commits to vigilance—with a visible cost in relinquishing her self-imposed exile and accepting endless payment. The structure is linear and legible, if somewhat quiet in external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Sylvar seeds the books → Vael discovers the riddle → the rune activates → Sylvar completes the unmasking. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost—Vael is stripped, the throne remains empty, the library collapses into earned stasis. However, the plan unfolds without real complication or reversal; there’s no moment where causality meaningfully constrains or threatens to break the plan. The piece reads as a well-shaped but relatively straightforward execution of a preordained scheme.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: scrap → investigation in archive → assembled data → conceptual revelation → recommitment to witnessing. Causality is intact and legible, with the underlying drive being meaning-making rather than external outcome, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “paths” and “assumptions.” However, most turns are reported rather than dramatized, and the “delayed revelation” is primarily told in summary rather than felt through time-bound setbacks. Still, the before/after in Lina’s understanding is clean and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: present action in the bay accumulates around the hum, beacon, and stone circle until her song triggers the broadcast, which clearly reconfigures the situation. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each intensification (hum → beacon sync → systems awakening → port-wide song) follows from prior beats. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the lull has been pierced and options reweighted, though consequences are deferred. The main limitation is the relatively low on-page cost; the change is meaningful but not sharply priced in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → cryptic script → decoded instructions → unsealing the amber → revelation of the seed and redefinition of “destiny.” Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the object’s meaning and the community’s guiding myth are reweighted. The structure is linear and clear, with backstory woven in without disorienting the reader, and the global drive lens (causal with thematic payoff) holds. The main limitation is that the resolution feels somewhat frictionless—no on-page opposition at the moment of transgression—so the cost is more conceptual than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival at the arboretum → progressive encounters with trees and memories → the decisive photograph-to-bark scene → reframed departure as “keeper.” Causality is soft but coherent; each somatic encounter builds toward the realization of what the “pearl of stillness” actually is. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves having accepted a new role and a new way to relate to his trauma, with cost legible in his acceptance that “the drone's shadow would always be part of the photograph’s chemistry.” A slight essayistic drift in the last third flattens some of the structural tension but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece presents a clear single-scene arc: descent to the library → discovery of the box/threads → understanding the pivot-point → choice to weave a new pattern → reconfigured exit. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (foreclosing other lives, accepting the ache). Stakes and situation are legible throughout, with no orientation debt. The only ceilinging factor is that external consequences remain abstract, keeping the drive slightly more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: eclipse ends → drone/ink experiment → disappearance → second controlled ink test → conceptual realization and renewed resolve. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the ink’s patterns are re-understood as the key to time distortion at emotional cost. The backstory about the mentor is clearly anchored in the present experiment and doesn’t disrupt orientation. The main limitation is that the external situation changes little—stakes remain mostly intellectual/emotional, with minimal narrowing of options beyond the loss of the drone.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: discovery of the mis-indexed letter → realization it rewrites history → decision to repurpose dormant tubes → broadcast → institutional collapse, all under a single, coherent drive. Closure is a decisive change with cost: she irreversibly exposes the truth, destabilizes the regime, and accepts that “tomorrow, the curators would come for her.” The scene stays anchored in one continuous window with no orientation debt, and the ending reconfigures the situation conceptually (the library as womb, not tomb) without losing plot clarity. A slight glossing-over of how the public feeds explode so fast in such a locked-down system is the only minor plausibility slack.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a quiet, accumulative progression from tower fall → daily tending → stranger’s visit → storm → altar closure. Causality is coherent and the lens (textural build toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending) holds. Closure lands in the final image of the altar and glowing dome, but the before/after shift is modest—she essentially continues what she has always done with slightly recharged symbolism. Stakes and cost at closure remain more conceptual than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is very clean: cosmic disturbance → careful approach → summoning → encounter → release → quiet aftermath. Causality is legible under a textural lens, with each move (“voicing silence,” driving the spike, withdrawing it) logically following the last. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Avery reframes “catching” as witnessing and letting go, with the rail spike’s residual grief as cost. The piece could press a bit harder on what would change for Avery’s life if she chose differently, but the before/after is still clear.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: call → investigation → recognition of past suppression → board’s kill memo → her counter-memo and email to Mara → dawn vigil. Closure lands via a decisive choice that reconfigures her stance toward her father’s legacy and the paper’s behavior. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end (“better to be the telescope than the black hole”). Escalation is somewhat quiet—board opposition and concrete consequences stay offstage, which trims a bit of force from the structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: letters → recognition of past harm → prescribed ritual → execution → systemic correction, all tightly linked. The global drive is largely causal within a lyric frame, and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the tethers are undone and silence replaces the lab’s grief. Stakes and costs (children’s suffering, erasing constellations, losing the lab) are paid off in the final beats with legible before/after. A minor limitation is that the “method” feels smoothly executed with little on-page risk of failure or interruption, so some potential for structural tension remains untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal-accumulative: arrival → contact with tile → instruction → alteration of the mandala → transformed grotto and released voices, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: silence is redefined as something with “vocabulary,” and the grotto becomes an enduring memory-holding counterpoint to the village’s cyclical forgetting. Stakes and consequences (reconfiguring how fear and trauma are processed) are legible, if quiet rather than dramatic. A slightly sharper articulation of risk at the moment of breaking the circle would deepen the sense of cost, but nothing essential in causality or closure is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: Arin walks, remembers, finds the tessera, names the plaza, and the final projections toward rebuilding close the loop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the plaza’s meaning and name change, with a clear before/after. Still, there is only one modest narrative turn (deciding the new name), and much of the latter half reiterates this shift rather than deepening or complicating it. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is legible and steady but not pushed to its fullest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: theater → maze → orchard → coin/echo climax → quiet reset, with a clear before/after (actress renewed, ghost’s encore repurposed). Causality is soft but legible—his actions in the orchard create echoes that reach her rehearsal and fuel her turning point. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration, yet the cost is light and the “fractured timeline mending just a little” feels more gestural than earned. No major orientation or lens issues, but escalation remains fairly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is coherent and essentially one continuous, accumulative scene: static shock → experiment → resonance mapping → conceptual solution → resolved stance. Causality is mostly sound, with the static shock and thumb-mark plausibly motivating the “somatic marker” method, and the geode resonance leading to insight about disrupting feedback loops. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing/RR, with Lina reconfiguring the recalled pill from pure hazard to doorway, but the cost and consequences remain largely abstract. Escalation is more informational and imagistic than dramatic, which keeps the piece from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: discovery of the fossil → following emotional heat-signatures → realization of the caves as repositories → choice to sing and then to carry the map back to the surface. Causality is soft but legible, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early on. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lira emerges changed in role, now a bridge for a future waking humanity. The felt cost remains more implied than dramatized, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: discovery of the jar → long, button-based deciphering → final assembly of the prophecy → conceptual reorientation and sharing through the amber walls. Causality is intact under the chosen lens, with each element of the process (echo-catchers, buttons, jar) feeding the eventual clarity. Closure manifests as a conceptual repricing: the meaning of time-keeping and prophecy is reweighted toward openness and communal ownership, with her decision to embed the echo in the warehouse as the culminating act. The cost is subtle but legible—her lonely, life-consuming labor and the implied renunciation of custodial control over time.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally clean: a single, continuous meet-at-the-bluff scene with a clear causal chain from arrival, demand for proof, excavation, to reinstatement. Closure lands via a decisive change in status (traitor to reinstated operative) and a reconfiguration of Kael’s belief about the cost of doing right, both on page. The main weakness is that the external turn—the courier accepting proof and immediately vouchsafing passage—feels almost too frictionless, with no on-page complication once proof appears. Still, the drive lens (causal with a reflective overlay) holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: waiting → sensed arrival → crossing → needles/clock alignment → gutters fall silent and restart, yielding a clear before/after. The dominant stake (will their long-delayed promise resolve) is legible early and narrows to this single crossing with the gutter-clock as structural spine. Closure lands strongly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the needles touching and the last tick reprice the whole history with a felt cost of decades. The piece stays in one situation without temporal confusion; causality is simple but coherent and sufficient for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: arrival → investigation → realization about kindness and time → ritual act (bowl and glass) → departure with altered stance. Causality holds at a lyric level, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she exits with new knowledge and a cost (leaving the oasis behind). The temporal-magic logic (place remembers kindness) is internally consistent and introduced early enough through the lantern glass and thrum. The main limitation is that the pressure never tightens into a true dilemma; the path from discovery to offering is almost frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: petal falls → walk to harbor → planting in the lot → return home and conceptual reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact: the rose’s death triggers a new project, and the bitting gauge threads past and present into a coherent closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (“The gardener had become the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both”) with an on-page cost: she relinquishes her old site of devotion. Stakes remain intimate, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: discovery of the sundial → awakening to time-as-web → learning the stone circle’s hums → decision to act as living archive and weaver of time. Orientation is strong from the outset and the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines “independence” and commits to carrying the extinct within her, with the implicit cost of perpetual haunting and self-fracture risk. Causality is soft but acceptable under a textural lens; some middle beats feel more like reiterated atmosphere (multiple similar “hum” and “memory” sentences) than genuine progression, which blurs the sense of a single tightening. The cost is present but could be sharpened on the page at the ending moment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: restlessness → discovery of the nest → creation of the installation → communal interaction → personal offering/letter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she places her signed letter in the spiral’s heart and understands herself as part of the “endless weave.” Causality is gentle but coherent, with each step arising from the prior image or realization. The main limitation is that the path from dissatisfaction to resolution encounters almost no resistance, so the decisive change, while legible, feels somewhat inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: escalating signals → discovery of subsonic manipulation → plan to interfere → dawn broadcast → partial communal reset. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light thematic overlay, and closure lands with a decisive change in the signal landscape plus lingering costs in human mistrust. There are no serious orientation issues; time (“each passing week,” “three sleepless nights,” then the dawn execution) and stakes remain clear. The main limitation is that institutional fallout and material risk are gestured at more than structurally tested, softening the sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: catacombs → organ as guide → compass reveals door → key → Architect’s chamber → blueprints and new understanding. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (conceptual repricing: knowledge and spatial reimagination as treasure) and maintains its drive lens throughout. However, the post-key discovery section drifts into extended explanation of the blueprints’ meaning instead of staging a final, pressured choice, softening impact and sense of cost. Stakes are never in doubt, so the structure reads elegant but low-friction rather than nail-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: quarry → ribbon → portrait → corrected height → vendor’s presence → arrest, with Elara’s choices as the hinge points. The two-shard structure (quarry, then studio/aftermath, then return) is clear and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she returns the ribbon and reframes her blindness as “a different kind of sight.” However, the investigation’s decisive moves (forensic glue match, height inference, arrest) are compressed into summary, blunting some dramatic pressure. The cost of success—beyond emotional awakening—feels slightly under-dramatized, keeping this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from decoding journals → entering forbidden coordinates → alarms and confrontation is coherent and clean, with a clear before/after in institutional reality. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the station flips from a debunking tool to a monument of “reversible exile,” with social and personal cost implied. Some conveniences—the camp and instruments surfacing at the exact moment of her override, the station being built precisely on Vance’s coordinates—lean on coincidence rather than earned friction but don’t break logic. The structure holds as a single, escalating sequence without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: hitchhiker vanishes → glass flake reflection → noticing scaffold wrap as code → decoding location → finding grove and photograph → new song as response. The piece reads as a Hybrid drive (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his relationship to the valley’s ghosts and to his own role is reweighted. Cost is implied in the burden of “sins of forgetting,” but the price of his choice to follow and play remains soft and largely conceptual. Structure is otherwise tight and linear, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean: we know who, where, and roughly when very early, and the frame of the failed startup on the circus train is easy to track. The structure is linear with a single present scene bracketed by backstory, and the causal chain (marking the space → Leo noticing → conversation → Leo’s stance changing) holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Leo abandons immediate resurrection, and the son reinterprets his legacy. The relative smoothness of Leo’s turn and lack of visible consequences keep the structural pressure modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: observatory → method via variable star → trance and witnessing → realization → inscription and archival act → quiet exit at dawn. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens: tracking Delta Cephei enables the trance which unlocks the confession and redefines the inscriptions and Elara’s role. Closure is a conceptual repricing of the inscriptions and the nature of the burden, with a neat cadence at “knowing her words had pressed their memory into eternity,” but the price of this new understanding stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequences. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failed fire spell → turn to last-resort seed and ritual → weakening and melting of the ice → revelation of the confession → emotional/ontological shift and lifting of the curse. Orientation is strong early (who, where, what the vortex is, what the druid wants), and the single continuous scene suits the scope. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in the world (curse broken, vortex settling) and knowledge (his guilt), with a legible cost. The structure is solid and publishable, though not especially surprising in its progression.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: glade setup → ritual with the clipping → maze vision and ancestral encounter → return with changed understanding and a concrete future plan. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure (reinterpreting the covenant and herself as the crossing) is on-page and legible. The dawn deadline gives light temporal pressure, and the story honors it. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after in her role and knowledge is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: burned card → descent → negotiation → ritual → imperfect restoration, with no missing links. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what she wants) and the magic rule (memories for destinies) is taught through action, not exposition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara can live in a new, cost-laden shape of loss, and the city above continues unchanged. The only small limit is that the negotiation resolves smoothly, without an intermediate complication or test of the bargain’s terms.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment appraisal work, backstory seeded efficiently, discovery of the cloth, then a small but legible reorientation toward her work. Causality is simple but intact—finding the cloth triggers the choice that yields closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes appraisals as a “song” and the cloth as her encore. The main limitation is that the decisive change feels almost frictionless; the cost of this new stance is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: city failing → realization the spirit became field → analogical deduction → carving the new “translation” into the arbor → stabilization and conceptual closure. Structure holds as a single accumulating sequence with one major deepening at the moment of insight about distribution versus departure. Cost is primarily conceptual and internal but legible in her renunciation at the end, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a mechanical fix. Stakes are declared at a vast scale but mostly solved through one smooth, unopposed operation, which keeps this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: tide recedes → creel appears → duty to smelt vs impulse to preserve → altered smelting method → reconfigured understanding of preservation. Causality is coherent even in this lyric frame; every major move follows from the stated world rules (lunar migration, archive duty, geothermal crucible). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she changes the rule of her work and reframes the Archive’s function, with cost implied in her quiet refusal of “perfect order.” The drive lens (accumulative/textural with a clear situational pivot around the decision at the crucible) holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: inspection → discovery of pearl/shells → fracture → crystal caves → choice to crown the pillar, which triggers the broadcast to the town. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with one clear escalation and a strong on-page closure that reconfigures the meaning of bunkers and buried hopes. The cost of her choice (demolition averted, protocol broken, emotional upheaval above) is largely conceptual rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: arrive at station → explore objects/space → encounter graffiti → re-engage with map and accordion → leave with reconfigured stance. Closure is solidly on the page: she reconceives forgiveness as an ongoing river rather than a fixed destination and crosses a psychological threshold when leaving the station. Causality is modest but coherent; each discovery incrementally reweights her relationship to the past rather than creating sharp turns. Cost—the persistence of guilt and the effort of facing the “night the river swallowed the bridge”—is implied rather than dramatized in a specific, high-pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: first letter → journey through mist → discovery of watch → cipher and hidden scroll → descent to the silent chamber → second letter and release of silence. Structure is linear and legible, with one dominant throughline framed “between two letters,” and the conceptual closure (reframing silence as echo) lands on the page. However, the stakes and costs tied to these steps are more implied than dramatized, so the decisive beats don’t quite tighten into real dilemma. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with enough causal logic to avoid confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: plant telepathy → revelation of the seed → empire envoy’s offer → Lira’s refusal → planting as decisive act, with a quiet but clear before/after. The piece holds a mostly causal drive with accumulative lyric texture, and closure lands as Earned Stasis plus a light Conceptual Repricing (destiny as garden rather than veil) with visible opportunity cost. Empire pressure, however, remains abstract and off-stage; the risk of defiance never manifests as a concrete on-page threat, slightly softening the climax’s bite. Structure is otherwise tight and linear within one coherent window.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a clear before/after: a soul approaches, is captured, and archived, closing in a quiet Earned Stasis. The accumulative drive (watching → approach → droplet → capture → placement) is coherent and causally legible, and closure lands with conceptual cost in the poet’s erasure versus the chip’s preservation. There’s no confusion about who/where/when, and no broken promises in the set-up. The only limit is that the narrative tension never tightens beyond a smooth, almost ritual inevitability, so closure is satisfying but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climb to perch → reflection and mandate for pruning → on-page act with Mrs. Chen’s grapes → final reconfiguration with the jam. Causality holds (her philosophy leads to the sigil ritual and the choice to witness rather than intervene), and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing where contentment is relocated from magic grapes to the tending itself. Stakes are modest but coherent; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that the central turn reads as quietly inevitable rather than sharply surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: campfire → approach → chime hesitation → unhooking → chamber epiphany → departure, with an on-page conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is simple but intact: lantern and chimes gate access; the keeper’s instruction reframes the protagonist’s stance. Closure is legible, with a before/after in how the cloak and shard are understood, though the stakes and obstacles are modest and easily overcome. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and POV are clear from early on.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: pond → lesson → realization that she herself is the vanishing → final act of throwing herself in as the stone. Causality works within the lyric mode, and the closure (conceptual repricing of vanishing/appearing) lands cleanly with cost—her dissolution into the grotto and erasure of self. Some beats reiterate the same realization (“to appear, one must first vanish”) rather than adding new pressure, slightly softening the arc’s tightening. Orientation is strong from the outset (Mira, platform, grotto, pond) and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from waiting to signal (birds), to experiment (quartz skimming), to revelation (pulse as compass), to role shift (keeper of pathways). Causality under a textural lens holds: each harmonic act and pattern observed layers pressure until the birds’ spiral and her answering skim crystallize the rules of this world. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change/RR where she gains the sought ability and settles into a new function—though the felt cost of that change is more implied than dramatized. The temporal navigation rules are consistent enough that the ending reconfigures the premise without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation and drive are clear early: retrieve the last keystone from the spire for decommissioning. The structure is cleanly causal—training and mandate → mist walk journey → encounter with the unbound keystone → refusal—and the closure beat is an on-page renunciation with visible cost (abandoning his pension, life, and role). The drive lens reads as largely Situational: the spire’s rules and the institutional assignment force a stance crystallization. Escalation is modest but coherent, with the central tightening at the moment he discovers there are no sigils and realizes the choice is morally his.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: lamplighting → discovery of the key tag → descent to the library → encounter with the log → revelation → resurfacing and return to duty. Causality in a lyric, accumulative mode holds: each object and location leads to the next realization. Closure via conceptual repricing (silence as the missing “color”) lands clearly. What limits it is the absence of real constraint or complication—events unfold almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: learning static → casting lots → discordant result → re-framing the question → “Align yourself” → final casting and transformation into signal. Causality is coherent under a textural/causal hybrid lens, with each beat deepening the same central drive rather than scattering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara becomes the signal and the observatory her vessel, with the conceptual cost of selfhood reframed rather than neatly solved. The only limit is that the “succeeded and failed simultaneously” paradox is gestured at more than dramatized, so the cost of failure is intellectually clear but not fully tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the observatory framed by a single prior discovery (the cylinders), moving stepwise from general reaping, to the act of crystallizing others’ fears, to the confrontation with her own. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens—each cylinder and named monster deepens the pattern until the void forces a reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the unnamed beast becomes a mirror of her own fear and the nature of her sacrifice. A touch more on-page friction around that final realization (some felt resistance or alternative) could raise the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual sequence where each step (positioning, counting drips, adjusting resonance, striking) causally builds to the partial restoration of the sea. Orientation is excellent from the opening—who, where, when, and what’s wrong are all clear—and the causal chain never breaks. Closure lands with a decisive change: the bell’s song reawakens the sea, and Kael ends in a new internal state, with the world slightly rebalanced. The main limitation is that the price of failure or partial success is kept abstract, so the sense of risk at the climax remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single night’s walk that leads causally from discoveries (label, photos) to recollection of the crime and culminates in the levee-station writing session. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with causal steps linking each found object to the deepening realization and decision to “expunge the official report.” Closure is present and legible, but the lack of any on-page pushback (institutional, personal, or environmental) keeps the decisive change conceptual rather than sharply pressured, so the before/after line, while clear, doesn’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: orchard → starlings → crystal-in-flame → violet offering → conceptual shift. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each move deepens the same drive rather than wandering. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing of what “harmonizing” means, with a legible before/after in her stance. The 48-hour clock and threat of the void remain more conceptual than dramatically activated, which keeps the plot from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: tether is failing → protocol must be revised before the next pulse → he revises and locks in the fix, receiving a confirming vibration. This yields functional closure (a quiet Decisive Change / Earned Stasis hybrid) with the burden persisting conceptually. However, escalation is soft—nothing truly complicates or threatens failure once revision begins, and the repeated returns to the same idea (“burden,” “trust,” “patterns”) skim toward redundancy. Structure reads more as a single, slightly stretched scene with lyric circling than as a sharply contoured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: timeline fracture → clones and temporal instability → imminent solidification → sensei chooses vivify/integration → clones collapse and history resolves. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: he reclaims feeling and stabilizes reality at the price of grief and the loss of his prior transcendence. World rules (ego death, vivify, complementary opposites) are compressed but consistent enough in a mythic mode. The structure holds as a single intensifying scene without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and clear: parcel arrives, Mara plants the seed, imagines its role, dawn brings the first stirrings—an accumulative/textural arc that does achieve a mild sense of before/after. However, the “closure” is largely conceptual (innovation as natural flow) without a concrete on-page cost or decisive change in options. Repetitions of the same idea (“safeguarding a space for innovation,” “orthogonal paths”) create the feeling of circling rather than escalating. The final image of the seedling and dawn works as a gentle resonant reconfiguration but not at a level of high-impact closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: Eleanor’s death → tunnel → wind-lullaby haunting → Sarah’s reaction → adjusted haunting → sibling reconnection → Eleanor’s release. Closure is strong and on-page: Eleanor’s cord dissolves and she begins to thin just as the house “begins to thaw,” a resonant reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The echo tunnel and cord recur as through-lines, preventing the lyricism from feeling formless. There are no orientation or causality slips; the piece sustains one coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is accumulative/textural but coherent: discovery of the pendant → experimentation (licking, interiorizing exteriors) → conceptual turn (boundary of light/knowing) → closure in a redefined “home as waiting.” Causality is soft but present (“because it interiorizes the pendant/world, the garden dissolves into the library inside, so exile is reinterpreted as translation”). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with cost: the door appears but is not taken, foreclosing the fantasy of easy escape in favor of an earned stasis. There are no orientation issues; the one-scene frame in the frozen courtyard is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: set-up of the familial curse and failed embers, attempt with familiar methods, conceptual turn about creative destruction, sacrificial act with the crozier, and a quiet but decisive exit. Causality is sound under an accumulative/textural lens—the realization about sacrifice leads directly to the crozier-breaking, which leads to the undead-glass outcome and her shift in stance. Closure reads as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: she reframes both “success” and “failure” and chooses to live with the incomplete. The only limitation is the relatively low on-page resistance; nothing external pushes back in the moment, so escalation feels more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: problem established (unknowable shard), failed attempts summarized, new tactic chosen, executed, and paid off in a reconfigured understanding of the towers’ purpose. Causality is tight under a largely causal/accumulative lens—her choice to strip down and listen directly leads to the realization that the shard is a seed and to the tower’s transformation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: the world’s communication paradigm flips from broadcasting to listening with a clear “before/after.” The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible: she abandons her prior framework and commits to a long, solitary project.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is coherent as an accumulative, ritualized scene: clocks skew, ferry vanishes, Lina performs the merge, and we return to the cyclic status quo. Causality inside the magic system is sketched but mostly accepted rather than dramatized—she tunes the radio, uses the hourglass, traces patterns, and it works without meaningful complication. Closure functions as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the cycle continues, but her role as “anchor and sail” is reaffirmed. The lack of a concrete setback or reversal keeps the plot from feeling fully shaped for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: setup in the gallery, weaving the mirror, the rupture via the false connection, the flood, and a reconfigured aftermath. Causality is coherent and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each move meaningfully escalates from subtle patterning to literal inundation. Closure is strong as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s understanding of connection and her relationship to the gallery are clearly “before/after,” with the thread gone and her stance altered. Stakes remain mostly abstract, but the narrative arc itself is tight and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates on an accumulative/textural drive: successive beats (anchor, classroom, Tethian visitation, reimagined star map, Corin’s question) steadily reweight the central question of how to navigate without a sky. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: “unfolded horizons” shift from literal surface-reaching to an internalized, philosophical mode of navigation, with a felt cost in Mara’s acceptance that she will never see real stars. Causality is modest but coherent; each development flows logically from her project and the world’s rules. The structure verges on repetitive in its declarations about horizons and geometry, but the final reconfiguration is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: hearing the pulse → misattributing it to the dead → discovering the collapsing man → intervening → paramedics arriving → narrator’s purpose reconfigured. Orientation is strong; we always know where we are and what’s happening, and the twist that the pulse is living rather than dead is coherent and grounded. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s role shifts from medium of the dead to protector of both dead and living. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: descent, approach, contact, and escape under a clear tidal deadline, with no orientation problems. Causality and the accumulative lens align—the return, the codex, the facility’s rules, and the ticking tide all converge on Marek’s decision to stand still and witness. Closure as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment is legible and satisfying, with concrete before/after in Marek’s relationship to the dead. The sequence is solid but could escalate one additional concrete obstacle or choice in the middle corridor section to deepen structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: she arrives with a goal, engages the ghost via ink and shard, completes the defragmentation, then reinterprets her own “clerical death” through that experience. Causality under a mostly accumulative/textural lens holds: each step (ink mapping, shard contact, ghost’s revelations) deepens rather than resets the situation, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of failure and identity. The late flashback to the death-certificate event is anchored and clearly tied back to the present frame. Stakes are modest and largely internal, but they cohere without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → contact with tunnel/diamond → harnessing birds → consequential aftermath, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the goal of rescuing a language is reweighted into birthing a new, earless voice, with the cost (the language’s total death and her exhaustion/death) clearly on the page. Causality within the lyric mode is consistent—each move (“therefore” to the birds, then to the diamond, then to the memorial) follows from prior constraints. The long-tail coda with travelers and posthumous singing extends, rather than diffuses, the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Lyn discovers the arrowhead, hears the static confessions, undergoes gravitational and bodily shifts, and reaches metamorphosis, with a clear before/after. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she exits as someone reconfigured by the harmony, with her prior bitterness conceptually foreclosed. However, several beats restate the same transformation in slightly different language, so escalation feels more like lyrical layering than concrete turns under pressure. Cost is present (loss of old self, redefined relationship to humanity) but remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: long-term failure → locust shell arrival → discovery of heart-rhythm code → partial statue awakening → clocktower counter-pulse → her deliberate surrender to the rhythm. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes a “bridge,” the statues regain humanity, and the world’s rules are reweighted with clear cost. Stakes are coherent and the shift from solitary resistance to collective awakening is legible. No orientation or lens ambiguity problems.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: past failure → ongoing ritual → tonight’s specific delivery → successful crossing and message received. The structure is linear and coherent, with one main tightening (preparing and launching the drone under time-limited protection) and a clear closure beat when the message “I’m alive” is revealed. The backstory of the burned letter is embedded smoothly and directly motivates the present action. The cost is modest but legible: his life is structured around atonement under persistent border constraints, reconfigured rather than resolved at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: years of effort → wrong turn → oasis discovery → song and fragment activation → carousel restoration → coda of renewed train. Causality is mostly solid, though the key discovery rests on a convenient wrong turn rather than a pressured choice. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: the train and silence are reweighted from tomb to sanctuary. The cost of that change, however, is mostly conceptual and backfilled (years of labor) rather than felt in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: we move from opening the library to searching, to the scarf-topology ritual, portal, encounter with the zeroth volume, and reconfigured return. Causality works on an accumulative/lyric track: each introduced element (scarf as map, hyperbolic shelves, analog memories) pays off in the portal and reawakening sequence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion,” with the library and patrons subtly altered. What keeps this below top-tier is the near-total absence of resistance or complication—the process unfolds almost frictionlessly, so the decisive “change” feels more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: discovery of the loss → deciphering the cipher → pursuit → failed first attempt → reconfigured tactic and conceptual resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing around “what is captured must also be released,” with the empty well as a visible cost. Orientation is solid from the opening sentence; the pattern of archipelago → pursuit → library return is easy to follow despite lyric density. The only limitation is that escalation and resolution unfold smoothly, with few surprises in the late beats once the governing idea is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative arc: arrival → waiting for the star → ritual → idea freed → Merrin’s reflective coda. Causality holds and the magical logic (first star, shadow-keyhole, disorientation) is internally consistent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with Merrin left in charged poise around her own unresolved fear and the woman altered by the implanted idea. Escalation is more tonal than dramatic, but the before/after is legible and carries a modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: return → investigation of shipwreck “constellations” → discovery of missing star → mycelium cultivation → ritual completion → memory restoration and thematic turn. The closure is solidly on-page, with a conceptual repricing of curiosity and “stolen” memories that reweights the entire premise. Stakes and rules remain consistent; the August/October mushroom constraint adds a concrete complication rather than arbitrary delay. The only limit is that the external stakes feel low-risk throughout, keeping the arc more cerebral than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from set-up (exile and task) through the tea-leaf ritual to a closure decision about staying. Causality is modest but coherent—the act of annotation shifts the shard, which prompts Lin’s question, which crystallizes the archivist’s stance on exile. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she definitively reframes exile as choice at visible opportunity cost. The only limitation is that the deciphering task never feels in doubt; there’s no real risk of failure or alternative tactic to structurally tighten the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: fading worlds → heirloom seed + dangerous method → prolonged effort → new world-tree that reconfigures the multiverse’s fate. The structure is essentially a ritual sequence with one main escalation (the seven days of work culminating in the seed’s cracking), and the closure lands with a clear before/after and on-page price. The montage compression works for a mythic mode and never obscures what happens or why. The ongoing pruning at the end gives a strong sense of earned, altered stasis rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night in the sanctuary with a clear before (carrying unsaid guilt) and after (integrated spirits, new purpose). Each unraveled knot functions as a causal step in an accumulative structure, culminating in the pearl and the covenant redefinition. Closure is strong and legible as a resonant reconfiguration; the cost (three decades of guilt and integration of the dead into her body) is on the page. The stakes and drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal underpinning) are coherent from early on with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: torn map → rumors → site visit → archival footage → seam detection → door opening → conceptual revaluation of the tear. The structure is linear, well-oriented, and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraphs as she reframes the “flaw” as invitation and marks it with a silver thread. However, the plot never tightens into a high-stakes choice; each step unfolds smoothly and successfully once undertaken. The accumulative drive lens holds, but escalation is modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: descent, investigation, conceptual turn, and ascent, all under a single continuous lens. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the snow globe shifts from “singularity of memory” to artifact; Cassian’s stance toward grief changes with conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven, but each observation clearly leads to the next insight and finally to the reclassification. Nothing important is left hanging, and the ending’s logic is fully supported by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: the balladeer encodes the ghost, the code seeps into the city, the scribe reactivates it, and the ghost is freed as the courtyard dissolves. Causality is soft but legible within the mode, and the transition from sky-courtyard to city alleys is clear and purposeful. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost’s song, once trapped in stone, disperses into the world at a conceptual cost (the courtyard’s dissolution, the balladeer’s vanishing). What’s missing is any structurally significant complication or reversal; the arc is essentially linear fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure—an elevator ascent paired with successive diary revelations—is clean and legible, with each floor marking a new beat in Kai’s understanding. Causality is strong: goggles + altitude + scattered light → legible diary → revaluation of the relationship → altered stance in the captain’s quarters. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: Kai’s decision to set the goggles down and accept a tempered grief clearly marks a before/after. Stakes remain intimate and never waver, but the escalation is more accumulative than sharply turning, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is clean: single scene, present pressure (broken gondola) interwoven with one backstory thread (Thorne) that feeds the final act of recording the true cause of death. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “empty spaces” as human silence rather than the sky, with a legible before/after in her understanding. Yet escalation is modest and largely reflective, with the key revelation about Thorne already settled in her mind and the physical danger resolving without real consequence. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural rather than tightly causal, which fits, but limits punch.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: setup of demolition + coin + sky-aim, development through the mural-crafting, and closure when the building falls and the sky “escapes” into him. Causality is clean—his choice to use the coin on the walls leads to the fractal sky, which in turn gives conceptual weight to the demolition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the loss of the library reframes the sky as inward and enduring, with a visible cost (the building’s destruction). There are no orientation issues; time, place, and drive remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: phrasebook → hopscotch pattern → coordinates → Kess → flight → discovery → carvings/legacy realization. The structure is linear and coherent with a clear before/after: Elara shifts from obscure apprentice to discoverer with a new understanding of her place in a lineage. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but there is little sense of cost or risk along the way. Because everything unfolds smoothly on first attempt, the arc feels more like a successful errand than a contested quest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean in a mythic, accumulative way: prophecy → gear uncapped → mist path → mirror lock → larger gear → hall transforms. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the library thaws, time resumes, and her internal stance on repair shifts. However, stakes are low and there’s no meaningful cost or real risk of failure; events feel procedural rather than pressured. Structure is linear and coherent, but the drive lens (accumulative lyric quest) never tightens into something more exigent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent and legible: chalk messages → rediscovery of the bell → activation of the hidden reservoir → orchard’s renewal → ghost’s fading → later drought instructions. The structure is accumulative and mythic, with a clear before/after and a closure that reconfigures the community’s future stance. However, most major beats are summarized rather than dramatized, especially the later drought and crop rotation, which flattens turning points into exposition. The cost of the ghost’s disappearance is conceptually present but not deeply pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: climb → preparation → adjustment → transformation → rest, with each step causally or metaphorically deepening the central act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the clock stops counting down and simply “is,” she becomes the lullaby, and time’s stakes are repriced into mercy. The cost—her surrender of the puppet and of her separateness from the lullaby—is on the page and conceptually legible. The drive lens (accumulative lyric with conceptual repricing) is stable and pays off without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: travelers lost → Elara notices → clock/birds/frost constrain time → she assembles the path → they escape as the labyrinth seals. The single-scene structure with a live ticking clock keeps orientation and stakes clear. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she chooses, again, to save strangers and return to isolation, and the cost is legible. A hair more on-page complication or a small reversal beyond “one down, seven more” could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: ravine encounter → insight → lab application → conceptual closure on ongoing atonement. Causality is clear enough (foam observation leads to polymer idea), and the final realization about atonement reframes the opening grief in a legible before/after. Still, the cost of this shift is more implied than dramatized; the story largely skips any real test or setback between insight and successful lab execution. The result is a solid but relatively low-tension arc whose closure reads more reflective than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: opening day lull → first client → montage of others → dusk and the vendor’s own threshold choice → external confirmation as the woman begins to write. Causality is poetic but coherent: moonlight incision leads to beginnings, discarded narratives become compost, stars as new stories. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vendor accepts a perpetual liminal role while a former customer enacts her new beginning below, with a clear before/after. Stakes and costs are conceptual rather than visceral, but they are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → descent to pavilion → progressive reading of pools → moral crux → return and aftermath, with each phase causally and emotionally linked. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: he cannot erase the loss but changes who bears the sharpness, and the bread image and waiting pavilion lock in a before/after. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear very early despite the lyricism, and the fantasy rules are coherent. A slightly sharper sense of present-tense jeopardy (e.g., physical/temporal danger in the pavilion) could have pushed the structure even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline—from finding the weight to gathering voices to reviving the clock—is clear and earns a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure is strong conceptually: the town’s listening changes and the clock’s function is redefined as communal, not merely mechanical. Costs (historic division, effort, and vulnerability in convening the town) are implied rather than dramatized as sharp on-page obstacles, keeping the stakes somewhat soft. Still, the structure is clean and accumulative, with no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival at canyon → activation of mirror → modifications → aftermath and conceptual repricing. Closure is present in her acceptance of entanglement and the reweighting that “all mirrors are broken, all memories entangled, all canyons are ultimately mind.” Causality is loose but consistent within the lyric mode; each move grows out of the prior one conceptually. The main limitation is that the decisive change is mostly intellectual, with little on-page friction testing her course.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prism → doodle → grotto → inversion → combinations → escape → return, with a legible before/after in her possession of the “seeds of vigilance.” The hour of inversion provides a structural clock, and there is a clear if modest closure as she returns to the library changed in knowledge. However, the risk of being trapped inverted never materially constrains tactics beyond generic hurrying, so the cost at closure is mostly conceptual. Overall it reads as a well-ordered quest vignette rather than a fully pressurized plot.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: discovery → decoding → first music → widening ripple to the larger world → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where silence is re-priced as already musical, and the world’s “heartbeat of sound” subtly returns. Causality is soft but intact under this lens; each step plausibly arises from the previous. The main limitation is that the closure’s “cost” (the ongoing solitude, the discipline of listening) is more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene at the nexus accumulating toward Kael’s choice to leave the stone and walk away before the eclipse completes. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is sound: exile → guilt → covenant deadline → nexus translation → decision to communicate via absence. Closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, with the covenant reconfigured rather than neatly resolved and a clear emotional cost. The piece is intentionally low on external events, which limits dynamic variety but doesn’t harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: workshop setup → tuning attempt → father’s voice/lock opening → sharing the night with a neighbor, all causally linked. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but the concrete hinge of the clasp opening provides a satisfying on-page closure. Cost is implied rather than dramatized (facing her father’s silence and then choosing to open it to others), which keeps this below the very top tier. Orientation is clear throughout; no lens or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: seed → experiment → test on minstrel → adoption by village → reflection and closure. Causality holds and there’s a clear before/after shift in the village’s state and in Elias’s understanding, giving a modest but real sense of closure (a conceptual repricing around stillness/decay). However, the story lacks a strong central complication or reversal; events unfold smoothly with minimal friction. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural rather than tightly causal-escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is strong: anomaly warning → prep → inversion → ascent → central arch → seed-archive → conceptual shift, all under a one-hour constraint. Orientation (who/where/when and the rule of inversion) is clear very early, and the story keeps a single, coherent scene with one transition (entering the arch). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: resilience is redefined as encoded failure embraced rather than avoided, and this clearly reconfigures how Kael will act in the orchards. The main weakness is that the journey encounters few setbacks or tactical adjustments, so the structural arc feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal line is clean: arrival → surveying wind → hypothesis of the accident → mapping patterns → decision to publish findings. Structure is linear and coherent, with the investigative process providing natural progression and a quiet but legible closure (a charged resolve to act on her findings). However, the decisive change is intellectual more than dramatic, and the cost of that realization (or urgency) is only lightly sketched. This works well for a strong, publishable draft but feels modest in ambition for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: the hush, the need for aurora, the sculptor’s first strike as cue, the bells fracturing silence, and the cavern’s transformation. The accumulative/lyric structure holds together, and closure lands via the decisive change from captive to unfettered wonder. However, the path from problem to solution feels almost frictionless, with no real setback or complication once the ritual begins. Cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatized, keeping this solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: journey into the range → playing the flute and opening the seam → vision of the vault/failure → realization and return. Causality is coherent and also supports an accumulative, reflective build, with the seam-opening as a clear pivot that reconfigures his options and understanding. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: failure becomes “not a wall but a door,” and he chooses return-with-burden over escape. The main cap is that the external stakes of the rift (what concretely could happen if misused) remain somewhat abstract, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: two test cases, a reversal (empathy flowing back), and a recalibration leading to the final conceptual insight. Causality is stable—halo fragment to ambiguous prints to clients’ altered states to Cassian’s realization—and the pattern of experimentation is easy to follow despite the lyric mode. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: he abandons the hope of a simple “equation” yet reframes empathy as a flux with a cost visible in the spent fragment and vanished stars. Stakes remain relatively interior and abstract, but the narrative drive is coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure (walk → encounter child → pendant use → observatory → years-later myth) is coherent and closure is clear, with a felt before/after once he relinquishes the pendant and the ridge becomes legendary. Causality is soft but intact: his choice to intervene with the seed and surrender the relic traces cleanly to the later myth of the tree and ridge. However, the repetition of the “sprout grew into a silver-leafed tree” sentence and the low-stakes observatory delivery dilute structural tightness. The cost at closure is more implied than sharply rendered, keeping this below elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: find the prism → test it on the frost → enter the “shifted hush” → receive the car’s message → reprice her entire project. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each step intensifies the same drive rather than jumping tracks. Closure is strong: her stance toward discovery reconfigures, with a real cost in terms of professional proof and the surrender of ownership of the “finding.” A slight discursiveness around the “truthful lie” explanation makes the climax fractionally more expository than it needs to be.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: long-term weaving → discovery of the puzzle → realization via the missing piece → deliberate sacrifice through the loom → message reaching Lin. The accumulative structure (repeated returns to silence, bead, and loom) builds toward a clear closure where Mei’s world and purpose reconfigure with visible cost. The rummage-sale puzzle does arrive as a slightly convenient magical catalyst, but within the fable-like frame it doesn’t break logic or lens. Closure as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is very clean: arches crack → council gives up → Ren speaks → research reveals barter → descent to mine → sacrifice → arches awaken. The structure compresses travel and research smartly without losing coherence, and closure is decisive and on-page with a visible cost (loss of inheritance and identity configuration). One limitation at this tier is that most major beats succeed on the first attempt; there are few complications or failed tactics to tighten the screws before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: strange shard → rift threat → realization of function → redirection → new status as guardian. Structure is linear and legible, with a proper tightening around the rift’s danger and the act of weaving. The closure—reframing the shard and her role—lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The main weakness is that the revelation about the shard’s origin and the prior failure is delivered as exposition, reducing structural surprise and on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: lamp failure → discovery of sea glass/ghostly presence → bottling ritual at the cairn → relighting → morning reply. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where safety is “bottled” and the chain reaffirmed—lands clearly. The emotional cost is mostly implied rather than sharply turned, but the before/after (an unbroken but now more consciously sacred duty) is legible. No orientation or lens-clarity issues undermine the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: world premise → nightly routine → discovery of prophetic power → storm rescue → thematic closure at dawn. Causality holds in a light, fable-like way (she speaks; the sea obeys; she later uses this to save the ship) and the narrative closes cleanly with dawn and the redefined meaning of her laughter. However, the cost of her choices is almost entirely conceptual; nothing is risked or lost on the page beyond generic “weight of destiny.” The drive reads accumulative/textural more than tightly causal, which suits the tone but keeps it short of high-band rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear under an accumulative/textural lens: present-tense practice → visitation/revelation → extended aftermath of new practice, with a clean before/after centered on the donor heart. Causality is intact: the master’s search leads to the stranger’s arrival, which triggers the heart’s memory-visions and reconfigures the master’s understanding and later work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—stories as a “second heart” and the master as “space between beats”—with that realization anchored in concrete images (sun trails, dyed garments). The main limitation is that the crucial heart-memory climax is somewhat summarized in a single sweep rather than dramatized in beats, slightly flattening structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: pin → sextant → moonlight healing → map of dreams → deconstruction → door → garden and realization. Orientation is strong from the outset; we always know where we are and what she’s doing, and there are no credibility breaks in the magical logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s understanding of the labyrinth shifts from sorrow-trap to hope-map, with the garden as concrete proof. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural but remains coherent and pays off conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: the mica window → discovery of dawn threads → recognition of the Dawn-Weaver’s Hymn → final sacrificial song. Closure is strong: the realm shifts from endless night to perpetual dawn, and Elias pays with his memory, which is clearly on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine, and there are no real orientation issues. The main limitation is that some beats (e.g., “He remembered, in brief flashes…”) are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of active turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense pressure around the invitation and midnight, interwoven with reflection that alters her stance, culminating in her stepping through the door. Causality is intact (invitation → years of hiding → mirror revelation → choice) and the closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration/decisive change. The cost of leaving the bookshop’s protective isolation is conceptually present but not sharply dramatized in concrete consequences. The accumulative, lyric build is coherent, but the middle risks a small sense of circling rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: discovery of the bread → gathering in the tea house → communal ritual in the garden → coda of later restoration, all coherently sequenced. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the courtyard becomes a charged memorial space and, later, a public ritual, clearly showing a before/after in how the city relates to its own forgetting. Causality is soft but present (“because” she refuses to forget, a small community and practice form and persist). The main weakness is low on-page resistance or complication to her project, which keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: repeated passes of “measuring” and recalibrating build toward the harmonic discovery and projection. Causality is simple but intact—dimming light → recalibration → discovering the queen’s vow frequency → temporary stabilization of the library. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the library is briefly saved, the duty continues, and the cost is that oblivion is only delayed. The structure is somewhat monotonous, with many near-identical beats that soften the sense of a singular tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causality is clean: stranger’s arrival → failed warnings/sabotage → discovery of the lock/recorder → capture of the betrayal → preservation of the truce. The piece lands a clear closure unit (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she preserves the external order while internally bearing a destabilizing truth. The main structural weakness is the convenient coincidence of the watch fob fitting a hidden lock that happens to contain the stranger’s recorder, which feels more like puzzle-design than organically set-up world logic. Nonetheless, the arc holds together and pays off the initial problem on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: anticipation of a three-way convergence, the encounter, and a quiet but decisive closure where Elara’s drive to “prove” gives way to sensing and silence. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: ring → sensed convergence → meeting → explanation → choice to relinquish the tool and the report. The cost is conceptual but legible—she foregoes the proof she has sought and accepts a future where her experience cannot be verified. The only limitation is that external stakes remain low and the conflict is almost entirely contemplative, keeping escalation relatively subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: retreat to cave → confrontation with lock/painting → mnemonic rhythm → opening → note and renewed drawing. The drive lens is primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and closure lands as a clear before/after shift from avoidance to engagement. Stakes and costs are modest but legible—facing grief and fear of creativity—without any real causality breaks. Structure is straightforward and well-scaled to the length, though largely free of surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the map → identification of the archive → confrontation with the guard → descent to the reels → discovery of her own lost conversation → return and transcription. The structure is essentially linear with one clear throughline and a satisfying closure beat when she re-engages with the recovered conversation. Some middle beats are compressed (“She spent hours listening”), flattening what could be sharper turns of discovery. Still, the closure reads as a clear resonant reconfiguration with legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure coheres: we move from world premise and her vocation through the creation of the masterpiece to the arrival of the child and the tuner’s reframed understanding. Causality is soft but intact—her long project enables the villagers’ experiences, which in turn set up the child’s transformative encounter and her shift from “preservation” to “transmission.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost: her self-erasure is accepted as necessary even as the work gains new purpose. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) remains stable, and the before/after axis is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset: android caretaker, desert rose dome, magnetic shift. The structure is a single continuous escalation—from discovery of the fear-box to controlled burn to post-burn reconfiguration—with clear because/therefore linkages (magnetic shift → glitches → fire-suppression loophole → burn). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the caretaker’s inner static resolves in parallel with the fears’ miniaturization and the dome’s re-stabilization. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk of fire, self-alteration) rather than dramatized through near-catastrophe, which keeps this strong but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → note → oral histories → key → Elena → mailbox letters → political mobilization. The story delivers a coherent closure unit (RR) where the community reconfigures its stance and options against development, with some felt social cost. However, several major beats—the council fight, the stalling of development—are summarized rather than dramatized, softening impact. Pressure never seriously threatens to derail Mira’s effort, so the cost feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: captivity → invention of the dance-cipher → accumulation of journal entries → final “liberate” sequence → AI misreads and unlocks → flooding enables escape. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in her status and the lab’s state. The main weakness is that many key beats are summarized (three weeks of survival, encoding key systems) rather than dramatized in scene, which softens the sense of mounting risk. Still, under a primarily causal lens, the structure is coherent and the ending pays off established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: whale beaches → gravity grief/memory loss → Mara’s forgetting → research/coffee divination → chamber → crystal → restoration, with no real orientation issues. The piece holds a clear Causal lens with a resonant reconfiguration at the end (world’s weight and his relationship subtly reweighted). The closure beat is on-page and legible, with the calm gravity/steady lanterns and Mara’s regained memory. The main structural softness is how smoothly his plan works on first attempt—little genuine jeopardy of failure once he reaches the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a linear ritual of placing twenty-seven cranes intensifies toward the final crane and the absolute hush, with each step legible and causally linked. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine—his actions modulate the brook’s “voice” until the code is unraveled. Closure is solid: the prophecy is indeed hushed, sound returns altered, and we end on a reweighted status quo where the world is “unchanged” but conceptually at risk. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is clear and the scene never loses orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—weekly visits, deepening lessons, then the renovation threat and basement ritual—builds cleanly to a closure where Alex takes on a new role. Causality is coherent: Alex’s fascination leads to Mrs. Voss’s mentorship, which prepares them for the decisive act with the seal. The closure is a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing hybrid, with Alex now “speaking for” the building and the “agreed-upon lies” being partially breached. The cost of this choice (the burden of memory, opposition to future erasure) is present but could be made more concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly visits → present-night task → shell listening → speaking → archive completion, all under a coherent “last star” clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: independence is redefined, the shell falls silent, and her options going forward are conceptually altered. Causality is more emotional than event-driven, but each step (listening, speaking, releasing) follows clearly from the prior one, and no set-up is left hanging. The escalation is gentle and could use one sharper hinge of resistance or doubt, but the structure holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: forge scroll → access hidden mechanism → use thorn as key → unlink tyrant’s seal → see power wane in summary. Closure is decisive and legible, with a clear before/after in the empire’s power and in Elara’s relationship to her father’s legacy. However, the operation unfolds almost frictionlessly, with no complications or reversals, so the structural arc feels somewhat flat despite being coherent. The final temporal widening (“In the days that followed…”) works but slightly diffuses immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is accumulative and largely coherent: she investigates the canyon, uncovers a conspiracy of silence, discovers the lingering echo of a lost love, and shifts into a conscious role as guardian of echoes. Closure is present as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she accepts that some echoes are to be heard rather than solved, and that her task is ongoing, not conclusory. Causality is soft but legible; each move (“she sings,” “the canyon answers,” the shell fills, the name is revealed) generally flows as a because/therefore chain within a lyric frame. The main weakness is that the “web of intrigue” and conspiracy are summarized rather than dramatized, so the middle feels like a conceptual bridge rather than a fully pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: months of dream analysis lead to the shrine ritual, which leads to the wreck, hidden compartment, pristine globe, lullaby, and then the dream-gift epilogue. Closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: Elias finds peace, the secret is exposed, and Maya’s role as mediator between worlds is quietly reaffirmed. The cost is subtle but present—Maya shoulders knowledge the living world will never have and chooses mercy over factual completeness. Structure is linear and clean, though the lack of genuine reversals or complications keeps it from feeling fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a smooth accumulative lyric: initial solitary practice, Kael’s lesson, then communal diffusion of the philosophy. Causality is soft but coherent (philosopher’s method → Kael learns → village subtly shifts), and the pattern of images (moon paths, fireflies, whisk) supports a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the before/after line is more atmospheric than decisively felt, with little sense of cost to the philosopher’s endurance or the village’s change. Repetitive beats around the same symbolic actions slightly blunt the sense of progression.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong: anomalies → buried letters → discovery of STILLPOINT and the diamond’s true function → realization of the settlers’ role → decision to confront the council as a storm approaches. The structure reads as a single accumulating investigation that culminates in a charged choice, with the final storm and sirens providing a clean closing beat. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the situation and meaning of “curse” are reweighted, and the council’s power structure is on the brink of being challenged. The main limitation is that the climactic confrontation is deferred, so the decisive change is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one stormlit night of decision leading into a brief coda summarizing the aftermath, with causality clear (he decodes and broadcasts → villages awaken → legend and political shift). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “prophet” redefined as an age, Atlas as its first verse, with his disappearance as the decisive change. The Meridian Council functions as an offstage pressure rather than an active antagonist, keeping stakes slightly distanced. Nonetheless, the because/therefore chain holds and the before/after is legible with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: life in the loft → discovery of music box → invention and filling of jars → communal sharing → daily ritualized release. Causality under a textural lens holds—each new tactic arises naturally from the last, and the solstice opening of all jars provides a clear resonance-and-repricing closure where her role and the town’s relationship to memory reconfigure. The cost is present but subtle (the “weight of captured sound” as a new “poverty,” her shift away from pennies to an unpaid vocation). It stops short of exceptional because no beat truly squeezes her options or forces a hard choice; the arc is graceful more than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: trapped at the marina → shadow-thing rises → demand for the flute → she chooses adaptation via sonic tools → dissolution and afterimage of the drowned keeper. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration, and closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the guardian freed, her role clarified, and her inner “tuning” altered. Cost is present but subtle—emotional exhaustion, changed heart rhythm, ongoing duty rather than release; nothing undercuts it. Structure is a single, contained scene that escalates logically without orientation or rule-breaking issues.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: years of mapping → discovery of the viaduct’s properties → deliberate calibration → timed pulses that disable the tyrant’s network, freeing the people. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and solid, and the story lands a decisive before/after change with the communications collapse. The structure is linear, with one main tightening (the awaited alignment of moon, ice, and viaduct), and the ending image of communal mental quiet provides a satisfying closure. The absence of real interference from the enforcers makes the climax feel somewhat low-friction, softening the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: she investigates, discovers sabotage, links it to ignored warnings, then actively escalates by sending evidence to oversight and cutting Voss off. The piece is a single, coherent scene with a legible before/after: from nominally compliant investigator to open whistleblower. Closure lands via a Decisive Change (refusal and transmission of evidence) with an implied cost of retaliation, even if that cost is not fully dramatized. Structure is solid and economical, though the middle could use one sharper beat of concrete pushback or danger to fully match elite-level tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: chaplain arrives with the box, Marlowe repairs it, music plays, and the chaplain leaves with a reconfigured understanding of his work. Causality is coherent and linear, with the music’s successful repair as the hinge that enables the final conceptual shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the chaplain’s calling with an implied but legible emotional cost. Escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, yet sufficient for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the arrow tip → transliteration through the kaleidoscope → evolution of the yearning algorithm → construction and activation of the resonator. Orientation is strong early on, and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the workshop’s existence is redefined as an eternal, unheard ringing that stretches across time. The main weakness is that the risk of altering buoyancy toward toxic clouds is noted but never quite pressed into a concrete dilemma or consequence on the page, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline—from noticing the numbers, to investigation, to lying for access, to uploading the video—reads coherent and accumulative, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (she’s turned passive archivist into active subversive. Closure is present: the cold case is no longer “cold,” and her creation of the mirror forecloses silent complicity. However, obstacles are minimal and easily passed (the security AI is defeated in a sentence; the sealed vault opens without friction), so escalation feels low-risk. The repeated return to the numbers and songs gives an accumulative structure, but some beats feel like restatements rather than new turns.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: loss of the crystal → mirror discovery → revealed blood cost → council confrontation → sacrifice and reconstitution, with no major logic gaps. Closure lands solidly: the crystal reforms, the community’s options re-open, and their ethos shifts toward empathy-as-compass, with the boy’s choice as a visible price. Structure is essentially linear with one purposeful detour (the vintage store sequence) and reads as a coherent accumulation toward that decisive act. The cost is more spiritual/social than materially harrowing, but it is legible and tied to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a continuous day at the drift-ice marina where each pass over wind/ice/objects deepens the central question rather than advancing via big causal turns. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, why), and the pattern of ice sounds leading to conceptual closure is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from seeking her own end to curating “small mercies” for others. The main weakness is a mild sense of circularity in the middle, with a few beats reiterating insight without substantially tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: bus departure → discovery of the fragment → vineyard walk → burial and letter-writing under the pavilion → final cosmic zoom to stars. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from passive witness to someone who curates and transmits a pattern of understanding, with the buried vial as a quiet terminal act. Causality is simple but intact; each step grows plausibly out of the previous one. The main limitation is that the stakes and costs of these actions are conceptual and low-pressure, so the before/after line, while present, is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative, ritual-like structure is coherent: prophet’s warning → descent to parapet → consecration → coda of cyclic continuation. Causality is intact but minimal, with very little sense that failure is possible or that her options ever narrow. Closure does land as a resonant reconfiguration (echo preserved, cycle extended), but the cost of success is abstract rather than dramatized. The extended, repetitive coda after the core ritual slightly blunts structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (return visits to the field as the community slowly joins in) is clean and coherent, with time marked by “as vines climbed higher each year.” Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the ruins’ meaning shifts from monument to loss to “cathedral of remembrance,” and the masterpiece is explicitly never finished. Causality is soft but consistent for a textural piece: the archivist’s ritual leads to communal participation, which redefines the space. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight and legible: discovery of the crystal → weeks of experimentation → external clock (condemnation notice, chained doors) → the null result on his name → desperate reading → leaving the crystal behind. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is consistent, and the final Conceptual Repricing (growth as erosion; value of unrecorded testimony) lands with on-page cost. The external stakes (loss of the library to digitization) and internal stakes (personal erasure) converge neatly at the climax. A single, slightly summary-heavy middle paragraph (“Elias spent weeks…”) softens moment-by-moment pressure but doesn’t break drive.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a walk through the garden, a tightening around the sound, the spiral attempt, then a conceptual pivot to letting go. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with each step (markers → VCR → cassette → rumble → spiral) feeling like a deepening rather than a reset. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his goal with visible cost (“He would not remember this night…”), and the junkyard’s hum reweighted as an ongoing echo. Pressure is modest and stakes stay abstract, so it doesn’t quite reach an elite structural charge.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: spinning clock → recognition of planetary-scale danger → leaf-triggered capture of the star → restructuring the clock’s escapement → observatory steadies and Kael recalibrates his relationship to time. The piece reads mainly under an accumulative/lyric lens, but the decisive change of binding time to the leaf’s rhythm provides solid on-page closure with conceptual cost. Still, the resolution of massive stakes (lunar crust, escape velocity) through a single delicate adjustment feels almost too frictionless, softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: blood work → Elara’s decision → sonic ritual → Lena’s arrival → musical farewell → quiet aftermath, all under an accumulative, lyric lens. Causality is intact and legible, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration in which the family’s silence is bridged at the end of life—lands clearly with felt cost. The time shift to Lena’s arrival is smooth and the story keeps to a single coherent scene. The main weakness is that the path from estrangement to goodbye is very linear, with no genuine snag or complication once Elara commits to the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: question → investigation → key and automaton → rune sequence → successful resealing and conceptual answer. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the drive lens remains causal through to closure. Closure lands: the world is safer and the conceptual rule of shadows is redefined, but the sense of cost at the climax is minimal and the entity’s threat remains abstract. Overall, structure is sound and coherent, just a bit tidy and low-friction for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the mailed tooth forces re-examination, leads to the secret garden meeting, triggers Moira’s revelation, and culminates in Elena’s decision to retell the story and acknowledge Clara. Structure is tight—a single present-tense scene with efficient backstory folded in via the tooth and journals—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a mechanical wrap-up. Closure lands clearly: Elena’s worldview and professional trajectory are re-weighted with visible cost, and Clara’s belated identification raises the moral stakes. The only slight weakness is that the final telescope beat, while lovely, functions more as a symbolic grace note than an additional structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: the grotto → polishing → village square → ongoing legacy produce a coherent arc under a single POV. Causality is clean (finds sea glass, chooses to polish, presents it; the village responds), and the closing expansion to “tides of time” offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. However, there’s minimal sense of risk or alternatives foreclosed; everything unfolds smoothly, with no meaningful obstacle or destabilizing turn. The result is satisfying but somewhat static, lacking a strong felt “before/after” beyond a serene mission statement.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clear: present-tense ritual in the garden, interleaved with compact backstory of the confession and its fallout, culminating in a shift from private refuge to envisioned community sanctuary. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of tending, patterning, and observing builds toward a Charged Poise ending where her stance crystallizes (“She would proffer this place to others soon”). Causality holds at this scale—her exile leads to the garden, her observation of icicles leads to the moss spiral, and those in turn to the plan to guide others—and nothing crucial is summarized offstage. The cost of that envisioned opening (risking exposure of a fragile space and re-entering a public role) is implied, not explicit, but legible enough to support closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative and clear: a series of ghostly encounters that build toward a conceptual shift where endings become nexuses and he chooses to “begin” against finality. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—the shell, the nexus, and the cameos are introduced early and pay off at the end without rule-breaking. Closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: he reinterprets his failures and the function of endings with a palpable before/after. The cost—relinquishing his old self-concept and accepting his characters’ abandoned hopes—is present but could be dramatized with sharper, more conflicted turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the arbor, the song, the vine’s reawakening, then communal confirmation and safeguarding of the melody. Causality holds at a basic level (she recalls and sings the song; therefore the vine revives; therefore the rite returns), and the closure image of the harvest moon and reborn tendril is legible. However, the path is almost entirely frictionless, with no real setback, uncertainty, or surprise. The “cost” is more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: ritual preparation → sealing starlight → heartbeat map → guided journey → reunion in the cabin, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: grief is reweighted into a navigable pattern, and the Great Silence lifts when the child is found. The emotional cost of undertaking the ritual and confronting the lingering presence at the stones is legible on the page. Escalation is soft but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clear: problem (broken, overloaded mechanism) → investigation (tuning forks, mapping angles) → realization (overload of dying moments) → redesign (refractive quartz) → activation and release. Causality holds cleanly, and the closure—a conceptual shift from harvesting to releasing echoes—is legible as a true before/after reconfiguration. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but the causal skeleton remains solid, with no orientation issues. What keeps it below higher bands is the relative lack of on-page friction or risk; success feels assured once the methodical process begins.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: each burden-measurement advances toward the final calcification and the revaluation of the “trap” as a loom. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—what she does with the lamp and her burdens directly enables the conceptual turn and physical exit. Closure lands clearly: the single sphere, the realization about the boundaryless trap, and stepping through the wall provide a resonant before/after with evident cost (seventeen years, unforgiven existence). The structure is linear and contained, with no orientation debt or rule-breaking reveal at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with clear orientation (Mara in the loft, in real time as the kettle boils) and a coherent accumulative/textural drive. Causality is simple but intact: grief → decision to carve and “contain” his spirit → enactment of the ritual → reconfiguration of what containment means. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she redefines crystallized time and memory’s role in the present, with a legible before/after. The only structural weakness is some thematic and imagistic redundancy in the late paragraphs, which softens the impact of the ending rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: scavenging → new fragment discovery → intensified vision of the ghost → brief negotiation → reconfigured relationship. Orientation is clear early (carousel above clouds, lagoon, scavenger) and remains stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the haunting becomes collaboration, with a felt cost in relinquishing the fantasy of undoing erosion. The arc is more meditative than decisively plot-driven, so the causal tightening feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery → mapping → rerouting flows → reactivating systems → community response → reframing the space. Causality is intact and legible (“because she reroutes X, Y comes back to life”), and closure lands in the terminal’s redefined role and the sextant’s enshrinement. What’s missing is any serious obstacle or risk that could derail her project; each step works on the first try, so the arc feels gently linear rather than pressured. The closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene of ritualized dismantling that accumulates toward a decisive reconfiguration of her relationship to time and her dream. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid—each step of handling the gears deepens pressure and leads naturally to the sanctuary’s “song” and her realization. Closure is strong: time “recording her letting go” and the new clock for herself mark a before/after with emotional cost. The only minor limitation is how smoothly the epiphany arrives, but it still feels earned by the prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: sundial → sensed anomaly in the water → hidden arch → secret chamber → map → renewed resolve, and the piece maintains a single, legible throughline in one continuous scene. Closure functions as a quiet Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: she acquires the map and steps into a new phase of the quest with reweighted understanding. However, the cost of success is minimal and nothing meaningfully resists her; obstacles are essentially puzzles she solves immediately. Structurally sound but not yet gripping enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → decoding process → discovery → departure, all under one continuous scene. Causality is straightforward (she decodes → unlocks knowledge → can now preserve wisp-grass), and the lens holds as textural deepening rather than sharp reversals. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the final paragraph reframes the dock and harbor as a living text of potential futures. The cost is implied more than dramatized—physical cold and years of learning—so the ending lands, but not at a life-changing or gut-level scale.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: we move from arrival to ritual in the garden to departure with a realized stance on “the geography of healing.” Causality is soft but present (she comes because the last ship has sailed, performs her work, leaves with a reconfigured understanding), and the closure—a conceptual repricing of healing plus the release of the thread—lands cleanly. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when are clear) and the single-POV flow is stable. The main limitation is modest escalation; the closure is quiet rather than sharply pivoted.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: discovery of the egg → decision to build an incubator → hatching of an unexpected hybrid → revaluation of what beauty can be, with the city briefly transformed by its song. Structure is linear and well-contained for this length, with the hatching as a clear hinge and the closing image as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Cost is conceptual/emotional—the burden of having unleashed an uncertain force—rather than enacted through a concrete setback or loss. The accumulative/lyric texture holds the throughline without breaking orientation or the implied hybrid drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a single, coherent scene: arrive at lagoon → discover injured bird → tend it using coin/thread/sand → inner reconfiguration regarding her scars and father. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through repeated motifs rather than sharp turns, and the closure—a felt lightening of her legacy—is legible. Causality is intact at the micro-level (finding the bird leads to action, which reweights the coin and scars), but the stakes and cost never really tighten; there’s no moment where an option closes or where failure feels possible. It’s well-formed but not dramatically demanding.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → celestial preparation → breadcrumb journey → geese’ pause → latch opening → fountains awakening, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after. Closure lands solidly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s relation to its own history is transformed and Kael’s role within it is redefined. Cost is somewhat soft—there’s no meaningful risk of failure or sacrifice beyond patience and emotional weight—which keeps the structure from feeling truly high-stakes. Still, for a quiet, accumulative design, the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure reads as accumulative: discovery of the gear, learning the equation, reconfiguring “light without fire,” then accepting the endless cycle. Causality is coherent and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—“perhaps infinity itself was just another kind of fire” reweights everything effectively. The gear’s dissolution and transition to her daughter’s emergence provide a clear before/after in terms of understanding, though the “garden demands a sentinel” rule feels slightly asserted rather than tested. Orientation in time and space is consistently clear for this mode, and the global drive stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure across the monarch migration is coherent: greenhouse rituals → spectral instruction → ribbon decoding → carving the spiral stone. Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens, and the closure—placing the stone by the river and villagers recognizing their own words—offers a clear before/after in Kael’s understanding and the community’s mourning practice. The stakes are emotional rather than event-driven, but the “mentorship complete” beat and the end of the migration give a concrete sense of cost and change. One could argue for a slightly sharper inciting moment or on-page crisis, but the existing arc holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight: ridge discovery → ethical dilemma → return to tower and reconfigured winding, all cleanly causal and confined to one morning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts role as both winder and witness, with the cost of holding a more complex, less blame-consoling truth. The tide and tower clock provide a mild but legible temporal squeeze that organizes the beats without contrivance. Nothing crucial is summarized off-page, though the aftermath with the town is left open, appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: chess game → walk to silo → opening case → decoding tapestry → realization → return to cemetery. Causality is intact and the ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration, with the gardener’s understanding of “intentions” conceptually repriced. The cost is quiet—more a soft burden of knowing and a nightly ritual than a foreclosed option—so the closure, while satisfying, lacks sharper consequence. Overall, the piece is structurally sound but not yet at elite complexity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: dwindling quartz → need for innovation → predictive modeling at the spire → written plan → council persuasion → long-term transformation. The closure beat (elders agreeing to the phased plan) is on-page and clearly reconfigures the settlement’s options, with the ice bridge constraint preserved. The cost—risk of drilling, potential catastrophe, and social risk in confronting tradition—is present but kept conceptual rather than felt in a concrete, immediate sacrifice. The brief future-summary after the decision reinforces closure instead of deflating it, but further dramatized resistance could have added weight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, single-evening structure is coherent: she hears the broadcast, decodes its nature, integrates it into the score, and settles into charged anticipation. Causality is soft but legible, and the pirate broadcast discovery provides a clear tightening of purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: the world hasn’t shifted yet, but the symphony has been transformed in preparation. The conceptual cost—risk of forbidden listening, staking hope on dust as audience—is implied rather than directly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural arc: gallery ritual → outside drift → conceptual acceptance, with a clean single-POV throughline and no orientation issues. Causality is soft but coherent—she brings the ash, powders the mask, feels a transient solidification, then loses it and reframes her drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (accepting incompleteness and impermanence) with a legible before/after. Escalation is modest and primarily rhythmic rather than structural, which keeps this solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: investigation → decision about encoding → patrol interruption → concealment/escape, with backstory interleaved in a controlled way. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Malach chooses method over narrative, embeds it in the cog, and withdraws, leaving a reweighted object behind. The main structural softness is the patrol’s reaction—confusion then letting him continue—which diffuses external stakes just when they peak. Still, the before/after in terms of what survives (Council myth vs encoded method) is legible and conceptually costly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one core class scene where the method is enacted, followed by a time-compressed coda that shows its long-term cost and persistence. Causality is coherent—the rosette and method move from Mrs. Kaelin to Marco, and the conservatory’s closure reweights the stakes of preserving a “vanishing art.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the method outlives institutions, with Marco restarting the cycle. The only slight shortfall is that the class scene’s internal turn is quite gentle, so the inciting pressure and climax are more suggested than strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: forbidden greenhouse → pruning/planting under alignment → sprouting knowledge fruit → tasting and resolution, with a clean before/after reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with the garden’s rebirth and Mara’s success, satisfying a Causal + accumulative-textural lens. However, the Order’s prohibition never manifests as an active structural pressure, so stakes stay mostly notional. The lack of a concrete obstacle or cost keeps the plot from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal and accumulative structure is clean: blackout → discovery of box → riddle-answering via curse → activation of honeycomb → partial restoration/repricing of the city’s condition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara reconceives power as collected wonder, and the world subtly answers (the drone hives hum again, the city “remembers how to be surprised”). Stakes are more conceptual than situationally tight—there’s no timed crisis at the tower—but the before/after is legible and satisfying. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and the through-line of the box’s mystery to the tower’s revival is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.6)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: he gathers objects, places them, and the pattern of sanctification intensifies. Causality is soft but legible (he places objects; houses change; the town’s atmosphere transforms), and the final realization that it is the displaced objects that make houses “alive” supplies a modest Conceptual Repricing. However, there is no meaningful obstacle or resistance, so escalation is more a gentle expansion than a tightening. Closure lands intellectually but with low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diver’s death → ampoule transfer → revelations about foxglove, gardener, council, dome → Petra’s choice to use the dome’s flaw → long-term transformation of the city’s remains. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with revelations and images steadily reweighting the central stake rather than sharp reversals. Closure is solid via conceptual repricing and earned stasis: Petra’s role and the city’s “truth” regime are redefined, with the foxglove forest and cracked dome as the before/after proof. Stakes and cost are more philosophical than situationally urgent, which slightly flattens tension despite the structural soundness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: the wager → infinite climb → probabilistic search → impossible roll → rupture choice forms a coherent causal chain under a situational/accumulative lens. Closure is an Earned Stasis/RR: he consciously forecloses the escape route with a legible cost, reconfiguring the premise from “escape regret” to “carry it.” World rules (perpetual staircase, biased die, rupture) are internally consistent enough for this scale. The only minor limitation is that some mechanical steps of “how” his proofs map to physical movement are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page testing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: nights of ritual lead to the brighter waxing moon, to the mural, to Mira’s response, to the ripple effect. Causality is straightforward and legible (“he paints → she sees → she responds → others follow”), and the closure offers a resonant reconfiguration where his belief is partially vindicated. The cost is subtle—ongoing sleepless devotion, the choice to persist in quiet, small-scale work—but it is present. The piece aims and succeeds at a lyric, low-incident design rather than a high-turn plot, which fits but limits dramatic heft.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: beekeeper leaves → curse-like freeze / cultural withering → Liora designs and executes a ritual using the lens and bread → harp thaws and music partially restores communal life. Structure is cleanly linear with a legible before/after and a persistent price (the beekeeper’s absence, the city’s fragility) that survives the apparent victory. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is reweighted from pure loss to precarious hope. The main limitation is that opposition remains mostly declarative (engineers’ warning) rather than dramatized through setbacks or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrive → learn of hunger stone → discover yoyo → reverse-engineer it → use it at the tide turn → restore light and depart. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with an accumulative motif pattern, and the closure (restored beam + new stance on time) is clear. However, the solution unfolds without meaningful setbacks or complications, so the central problem feels solved somewhat too smoothly. Cost is mostly deferred (“would eventually hunger again”) rather than dramatized, which blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: drowning → second sight → cursed photograph → funhouse confrontation → interrogation of fear → release/reset, with no major logic gaps. The story holds a clear Causal/Conceptual-Repricing lens, and closure lands when fear admits its limitation, reweighting all prior hauntings. The attic shard transitions smoothly into the funhouse scene, and each object introduced (photo, clasp, dictionary) is paid off. The cost—living with permanent luminance and knowledge of irreversibly opened doors—is legible on the page, if more intellectual than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: storm approaches → she initiates fractal dubbing → storm syncs to her pattern → partnership replaces opposition. Causality within the lyric frame holds (sound generates resonance, resonance teaches the storm to “sing back”), and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the storm is reclassified as collaborator. The cost—a life of repeated blue-hour interventions, “new threats, new movements to interpret”—is legible but understated, giving the ending more conceptual than emotional weight. Escalation is smooth but a bit too assured; the outcome never feels genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the whistle → decoding its crack → crafting the shell whistle → summoning the watchers → repricing what “watching” means, with no orientation slips. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing: the watchers as historians of dead curiosity and the gate’s rust as consequence of understanding, reweighting all prior details. The cost—that true contact with the watchers forecloses a return to ignorance—is clearly stated, though it remains mostly intellectual rather than dramatized in immediate loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: petal-fall as inciting signal → search at station → discovery of the illuminated letter → decision to use it as a bridge → university presentation and publication. Causality holds without gaps, and the closure (truth acknowledged yet contextualized; station blooming as garden) lands as a coherent conceptual repricing. The last third leans into summarizing outcomes rather than dramatizing the hardest beat (the debate and its stakes), which keeps the pressure modest. Still, for a short, reflection-led piece, the arc is legible and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: bridge rises → he’s trapped with the pavilion → inspection reveals relics → he invents the capsule method → he secretly claims the site for the forgotten → he returns to the council altered. Structure is linear and legible, with one substantive escalation (from routine survey to quasi-ritual restoration) and a clear closure beat in his recommendation and departure. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but every step grows logically from the last. Stakes remain modestly scaled and internally focused, which keeps the piece just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene causal arc: blackout → investigation → hypothesis and test → Aldric discovery → restoration of light and order. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira reclaims a fragment of the library’s purpose, and the blackout lifting mirrors that internal restoration. The conspiracy/secret council thread is introduced late and then largely left as implication, which softens structural impact. Overall, the drive lens feels mostly accumulative with a light causal spine that holds without breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: shadow detaches → she adopts dream-harvesting craft → escalation through increasingly refined cranes → thousandth crane summons the shadow back. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/textural lens, and the closure unit (shadow returns, diamond lantern, her keeper/prisoner status) is on-page with a clear before/after. The cost—her scars, sleeplessness, and being bound to the basilica’s luminous torment—is legible and carried into the final image. The main structural limitation is that individual turns blur slightly in the lyrical flow, so beat-to-beat tightening is felt more by repetition than by sharp inflection points.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, time-boxed scan framed by the circuit-breaker cooldown, punctuated by one key turn when the algorithm “screamed” and she finds the pool under the cathedral. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each technical step compounds the emotional and conceptual stakes rather than creating plot twists. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing—unused potential becomes “infinitely remembered”—with the cost being Kael’s commitment to bearing that weight indefinitely. The only limitation is that the clock-driven frame never fully sharpens into a decisive choice beyond staying to witness, so the climax feels quietly inevitable rather than structurally bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: missing chip → drone reconnaissance → glyph → orrery puzzle → extraction → decoding → transmission, with no glaring logic breaks. The structure is essentially single-threaded and linear, with one central puzzle beat and a reflective coda; closure takes the form of a conceptual repricing of “belonging” via the decoded frequency and the collective’s response. Cost is present but subtle—more existential than situational—and the ending cadence feels resolved. A touch more friction or a decision with clearer downside in the final third would deepen the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and linear: terrace → descent to shore → search among carvings → plaque reveal → decision, which gives clear closure with emotional cost. Causality is intact: his desire for truth motivates the search which leads to the plaque and consequent reorientation of his life. The drive is largely accumulative and interior, so tension never becomes sharp, but the decisive change is legible and on-page. No orientation issues or lens ambiguity, though escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and a straightforward causal chain from moon-rise → causeway revealed → crate opened → prisoners escorted away. The global drive reads as Hybrid with a strong Situational/Accumulative component—ritual pressure and atmosphere rather than sharp plot turns. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange succeeds and Kael’s stance crystallizes around using history as a key, but the cost is mostly conceptual and soft-edged. The threat of war reignition is stated yet never materially tests their tactics, so while the closure is legible, the structural pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is simple but solid: launch → fog/失 of landmarks → confrontation with compass/memory → cannery → inland turn. Causality is clear (fog removes poles, forcing reliance on memory/compass; compass points inland, prompting his decisive shift). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he relinquishes the old instrument and chooses a new bearing, with felt cost. The accumulative drive (poles, memories, regrets) coheres well without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: newspaper clue → labyrinth journey → retrieval of the baseball → escape → ascent with a new stance, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change / Charged Poise: Kael redefines his role and commits to carrying empathy upward, with the baseball and signature recharged in the final image. The cost is present but light—some physical danger from the collapsing cavern and conceptual cost in facing his past, but nothing that deeply constrains his options. Structure is linear and coherent, if somewhat straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation, ritual, transformation, and contact with the beloved, all in a single cohesive arc. Causality is straightforward—fortune → spices → ritual → metamorphosis → answered call—with no major gaps or teleports. Closure is strong and legible: she irrevocably becomes a beast and a guardian, with a stable new status and cost. The main limitation is a lack of mid-scene complication or tactical adjustment; once the ritual begins, nothing really threatens its success.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: each action (ink, tracing, saucer, clasp) deepens the inquiry into where lost time resides and leads naturally to the conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the “midnight glade above clouds” pattern holds cleanly through dissolution at dawn. Closure is strong: the realization that lost time accumulates in her body and in the crack, and that she is “forgiven by the very act of searching,” reweights all prior images with palpable cost. The only thing keeping this from a higher band is that the causal stakes remain entirely internal, never facing a concrete external test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of Kwan Yin’s Tear → demand for shadow work → decision to stitch photographs → escalating gravity effects → portal opening → renunciation of escape. The story achieves an Earned Stasis closure as Maya turns away from the dimension of pure memory, accepting ongoing service with visible cost. Setups (gravity tied to emotion, preserved tears, warp-core thread) pay off coherently at the climax. The recap of 300 photos is compressed but still reads as built, not hand-waved.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain from crimson bug → inland step → dislodged stone → pig → bird → fish → clogged poisonous filter is elegant and legible, and the prophecy frame ties this to a coherent closure. The story lands a clear Conceptual Repricing: saving/being saved and coincidence/fate are reweighted in the final paragraphs. Stakes for the village remain largely off-stage and emotionally muted because Kael never discovers what he’s “accomplished,” but under a causal-with-fated overlay lens the structure holds. The ending’s cost—his completed emptiness and unheralded role—is on the page and feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: blackout → sundial code → hidden magazine → powder signal → fort-wide unlocking, with no serious logic gaps. The story lands a clear Decisive Change: a heavily secured fort becomes fully unlocked by dawn, and Seren has irrevocably altered its future. However, pivotal beats (cracking the bricked doorway, setting the charge) occur with minimal resistance, so cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. Structure is otherwise tight and linear, with a satisfying before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: establish world-rule (no friction), Elara’s method, the ritual’s build, the star dust flare and eel pattern, then the pivotal choice to deny a full restoration. Causality holds within a lyric, pattern-driven frame—visions intensify as the sequence nears completion, offering her a concrete possibility (a heartbeat of friction) paired with a cost, which she then renounces. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses witnessing over solving, accepting a partial, fragile adjustment to the world instead of a decisive fix. The only limitation is that the “offer” and its danger are conceptual rather than dramatized through a sharper on-page turning point or near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clear and cohesive: a single night in the observatory, framed by the ticking timer, the approaching storm, and the envelope, with a clean arc from waiting to realization to renewed action. Cause-and-effect is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens—the storm rarefies the air, enabling him to “hear” his uncensored voice, which prompts opening the envelope and recommitting to his work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes scars and censorship, chooses to write uncensored, and to carry the envelope back down the mountain. The main limitation is that the “price” of this choice (risk, loss, concrete consequence) is felt mostly in implication, which mutes the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward: waiting → decoding sundial/needle card → duel → confirmation of path → departure. Structure is clean and linear with a clear closure unit (he wins the duel and commits to the path the overture pointed toward). However, the stakes of the duel and of following the coordinates remain largely abstract, so the decisive change carries limited felt cost. The piece reads as a polished vignette rather than a fully pressurized story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—street vagrant → arrest → prison library → underground network → handoff to Cora—holds together cleanly and closure is clear via his decision to keep the poet-self and pass on the seed. Because/therefore causality generally works: the poem about the mayor leads to prison; library duty leads to Cora; their work leads to a “blooming resistance.” A few late reiterations of premise (“He believed that even in the bleakest anarchy…”) feel like summary rather than new turns, slightly softening structural tautness. Still, the before/after (isolated drifter vs. committed weaver of resistance) is legible with on-page cost in lost anonymity and ongoing risk.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm and erratic compasses → archive search → film-reel clues → coordinates → ascent to the arbor → performance as attempted re-write of fate. Structure is linear with one clear transition (station to arbor) and a coherent closure unit where his stance toward time and fate reconfigures. Cost is present (leaving the station, physical pain, accepting the clock’s continued silence), though the external storm threat never fully bites. The piece reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and closure is on the page and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: dream-seed → investigation → realization about the ridge → planting and song → awakening and aftermath. The monsoon clock provides a structural spine, and the closure beat (the ridge awakened, memory preserved, but reality destabilized) lands as a clear conceptual reconfiguration with cost. The piece leans lyric/accumulative in texture but never loses basic orientation or motivation. A more acute on-page complication at the planting/singing moment could sharpen the sense of risk and earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival on the islet, ritual instruction, seasons of practice, and a years-later coda all cohere around the drive to reconfigure her relationship to the severance. Causality is soft but consistent—Hideo’s method leads to the compass settling, to Mara’s longer stay, to her eventual role as teacher—and the final image of the color moving through leaves functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear from the opening sentence, and the time jumps are legible and purposeful. The quietness of external events is deliberate and effective rather than a plotting weakness.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, building sensory pressure until the Conceptual Repricing at the end. While the closure is legible and the text message effectively externalizes the shift, the turning point hinges on a moment of internal summary that feels slightly convenient for the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.5)
    Causality collapses under convenient coincidences and object permanence errors. The frost patterns matching a ledger's numbers is a massive, unexplained leap that resolves the central mystery without agency. The protagonist finds a "hidden workshop" with a furnace that is inexplicably "still warm" and contains a "safe" that appears from nowhere, breaking the logic of the setting and the survival scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative reads as a linear synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, relying on a "One evening" time jump and a convenient frost pattern to trigger the climax. The resolution comes too easily, with no failed attempts or escalating complications to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Days blurred into weeks") to traverse the central action of rebuilding the lens, which deflates immediate scene tension. The "dream" mechanism used to provide the repair instructions functions as a convenient shortcut, bypassing the causal friction of solving the puzzle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative collapses from a specific scene into a generalized summary montage ("The next night," "One night," "Mara declared"), diffusing all tension. There is no singular closure beat; the ending is a status report on the program's long-term success rather than a dramatic resolution with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality operates on dream logic with no established rules; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the central problem (the wound) dissolves instantly without cost. The narrative lacks a decisive change driven by friction, relying instead on a sequence of guided visualizations.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("She worked for months") to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and the climax, which dilutes the dramatic tension of a short story format. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the structure reads more like a synopsis of a longer arc than a contained, urgent scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality relies heavily on convenience; the puzzle is solved by a "gift" arrow that literally points to the answer, bypassing the need for the protagonist to decode it. The climax resolves via techno-logic where "poetic motion" confuses a machine, which lacks established grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist redefines her understanding of betrayal. However, the climax relies on the coincidental reignition of the forge rather than a protagonist-driven trigger, which weakens the causal drive under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where solutions (flower codes, easy riddles) appear exactly when needed without causality or cost. The closure—a conceptual realization about "translation"—lacks a felt price, reading as a convenient exit rather than a narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure effectively utilizes a compressed timeline (Track B Mosaic) to mirror the accelerating thaw, moving fluidly from the inciting leak to the nocturnal creation and final morning ritual. Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the bookmark's destruction ("soaked and darkened") into a tool for healing carries a legible, felt cost. The logic holds firmly under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    The resolution relies on a severe deus ex machina—finding the exact root password needed on a discarded cast in a bin. The plot advances through convenience and luck rather than earned causality or character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks genuine causal escalation or a decisive turn. The closure—walking away with a metaphorical map—feels inevitable and low-stakes rather than earned. The structure is static, serving as a vehicle for repetitive descriptions rather than narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the resolution relies on a convenient "magic feather" logic where plucking the string simply merges the timelines. The reveal that the glitch was a "deliberate stitch" dissolves the tension rather than heightening it, turning the obstacle into a lesson without a price. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of resistance from the environment makes the victory feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.6)
    The central mechanism—projecting a coherent narrative movie from doodles on a stack of tickets—is physically implausible and breaks narrative causality. The ending is a "happy wrap-up" that dissolves all tension without a decisive change or paid price, failing the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic, but the causality relies on the antagonists (the heirs) capitulating instantly to a metaphorical explanation. The resolution lacks friction; the transition from "skeptical" to "moved by wisdom" happens without an earned turning point or behavioral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured around the specific twenty-seven minute window, providing immediate urgency and orientation. Causality is strong: her prior favors allow access, the lever pull forces the climax, and the release signals the resolution. Closure lands effectively as "Earned Stasis," where she accepts the dismissal of her data because the internal proof is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is complete and causality is legible, but the climax relies on a sudden, unearned epiphany ("she understood now") rather than pressure forcing a change. The resolution feels like solving a riddle, lacking a sense of risk or structural deepening prior to the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is broken by a "soft reset" epiphany; the transition from smudging ink to hallucinating the word "forgive" acts as a magical resolution to the conflict. The action of weighing a piece of paper to find the weight of a secret is a metaphor treated as a literal plot mechanic, which shatters the scene's reality. Closure is achieved by fiat, not consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on "dream logic" where turning the wheel solves the problem without established mechanical grounding or trial. The closure is symmetric and tidy, lacking a sense of difficult trade-off or earned discovery beyond the intuitive leap.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Structure relies on linear sequencing and convenient magical solutions (the swan tunnel) to escape abstract pressure. Closure forms a Conceptual Repricing ("burrow into silence"), but the pivot is explained to the reader ("She realized...") rather than demonstrated through cause and effect. The stakes of the "world pressing in" are resolved by retreat rather than confrontation or meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on coincidence ("ordinary magic" and the eclipse) rather than causality to drive the resolution. The closure offers a "gift" ending where connection is achieved without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist, failing the requirement for a decisive change with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary exposition ("The diaries revealed," "Elias understood then") rather than dramatized discovery, reducing the causal tension. The closure lands a valid Conceptual Repricing (dreams migrated to walls), but the path there is smooth and lacks obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative moves clearly from inciting incident (finding the specs) to resolution, though the structure loosens in the second half, relying on a montage of outcomes spanning multiple timeframes rather than a singular dramatized climax. Closure is strong, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where she trades her name for control, but the linear success reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a procedure with a "magic bullet" resolution; the paradox loops defeat the entity instantly without complication. While the closure (Elias’s liberation) is legible, the "technobabble" logic of the solution (sound loops solving theology) simplifies the stakes rather than deepening them.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply enacts her desire without complication. The climax stalls due to repetitive phrasing, and the resolution (storing the shell) feels like a convenient stop rather than a consequence of the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing closure (surrender/dissolution) with clear cost. However, the causal logic operates on dream-logic and convenient epiphany rather than concrete pressure, making the resolution feel intellectually imposed rather than earned by the scene’s friction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fable structure that lacks causal grit; the resolution relies on a magical object rather than character action. The ending dissolves into a summary biography ("Thus, the deaf music teacher...") rather than landing on a concrete scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative creates an initial pressure (being followed) that evaporates immediately upon entering the courtyard, turning the central scene into a low-stakes ritual. Closure is a reaffirmation of the status quo without a visible on-page cost or a decisive reconfiguration of the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident (blooming) and a decisive closure (opening the vial). The use of the UV lamp to visualize the turning point is effective, though the causality is driven more by the environmental clock than active pressure on the protagonist's agency until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of thoughts rather than a causal chain of events; the protagonist enters, thinks, and leaves without a decisive change earned by pressure. The ending is a soft conceptual assertion ("he now knew") rather than a dramatic resolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" procedural without a meaningful causal turn, complication, or cost. While the sequence is coherent, the resolution is a foregone conclusion achieved through a single attempt, lacking the friction or deepening required for a publishable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean Situational arc with legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) as the dealer accepts the "residue" of the transaction. Causality is sound, moving linearly from preparation to sale to aftermath. However, the narrative relies on the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases to mark progress, which makes the structure feel slightly formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure is summary-heavy, relying on convenient leaps ("Days later," "She arranged") rather than dramatized scenes with causal friction. The investigation is solved off-page via a summary sentence, removing any sense of difficulty. Closure is a "tied with a bow" happy ending that lacks the required cost or decisive change in the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on a summary montage ("Days folded into weeks") to bridge the inciting incident and climax, dissolving tension and temporal focus. The resolution feels unearned by immediate action, as the acceptance by the villagers follows the magical discovery of the tag rather than a causal, high-stakes trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative drive is strong, utilizing the "Gasp" as a clear ticking clock that forces action. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the art, paying a definitive cost. While the specific mechanical link between ringing the bell and the protagonist transmuting into an echo relies on dream logic, the thematic coherence allows the ending to land with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, transitioning from a quest for answers to an acceptance of mystery. However, the resolution relies on a convenient magical response—the mosaic and orchard cooperate instantly—rather than a solution earned through ingenuity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is complete and legible, moving from the outage to the successful delivery of the object. However, causality is soft; the boy’s arrival and his immediate, intuitive understanding of the tape reel rely on narrative convenience rather than logical progression or struggle. The outage provides atmosphere but does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics significantly; the path from A to B is unobstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative structure collapses into a broad summary montage ("Each storm that season brought new lessons") immediately after the inciting incident, abandoning scene-based causality. This synopsis-like pacing dissolves tension and skips the actual process of change. Closure is a thematic victory lap rather than a earned structural resolution with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.0)
    The climax relies on an unearned coincidence (the scavenger holding her specific lost painting), which short-circuits causal tension. The resolution ("she slept") follows this transactional exchange without a demonstrated internal shift or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure, but the causality feels mechanical; the pilgrim acts as a static catalyst without agency or interaction beyond a smile. The resolution (letting the pearl absorb the forces) is a functional Decisive Change, but it resolves the tension too neatly, restoring a "balance" that feels unearned by the preceding abstract threat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is cohesive but procedural; the problem (silence) is solved by a specialized tool without a moment of failure or tactical pivot. While the ending reconfigures the navigator's understanding (RR), the lack of a visible price paid in the present tense lowers the dramatic weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative is linear and low-friction: Elara follows signs, arrives, and succeeds without obstacle. While the closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing (redefining her map-making to "absences"), the lack of complications or setbacks makes the journey feel like a guided tour rather than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative relies on a linear chain of convenient events where a magical object resolves the central problem (grief) instantly without causality or complication. Closure is a &quot;symmetric satisfaction&quot; ending where everyone is healed with no visible cost or trade-off for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear inciting incident (storm), rising action (engaging the mutiny), and a decisive closure unit (merging/dissolution). The "spatial mutiny" concept provides a coherent logic for the escape, and the final Resonant Reconfiguration effectively resolves the central tension by valuing ignorance over omniscience. Orientation is established quickly and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    The climax relies on an opaque transaction; it is unclear why the director accepts the ink pot exchange as sufficient leverage for federal fraud, or what "in the family" signifies in this context. The causality of the resolution is murky, relying on implied shared codes that are never established for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece functions as a static vignette or process description rather than a narrative with a causal or accumulative arc. The action is linear and successful—she starts, she works, she finishes—lacking a distinct turning point, obstacle, or intensification. Closure is temporal (sunrise) rather than a reconfiguration of stakes or meaningful stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative drive lens is handled well, building density through the collection of fragments to a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the potential causal hook of the "poison" label dissolves into texture rather than driving a sharper narrative turn, keeping the momentum somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic or lyric progression effectively, but the closure relies on a "realization" ending where the protagonist simply understands the theme to resolve the plot. While the Conceptual Repricing (shifting from busting to making) is legible, the cost is largely symbolic (a cracking shell) rather than a felt personal price. The causal link between playing the stringless cello and the shell's reaction acts as unexplained magic, weakening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=2.9)
    This is a synopsis covering multiple days and events ("One night," "darkest hour," "next morning") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default. Causality is weak; the resolution (agents seeing only a vibrant carnival) does not logically explain how the encoded maps or supplies prevent the impending privatization or physical displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, functional "and-then" structure where a plan is formed and executed without complication. While the causal chain (hourglass-grain-flare) is legible, the lack of unforeseen obstacles or meaningful deviations results in a predictable trajectory. Closure lands as a "Resonant Reconfiguration"—the living bloom lost for the static image—but the smooth execution minimizes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    The climax relies on a causality break: the *Prospect* departs ("vanished") while the drone meant to guide it remains in the shop, creating a confusing timeline disconnect. Furthermore, the resolution—spotting a fracture via visual light refraction—is causally invalid for a blind protagonist, breaking the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear dream-logic progression where obstacles are removed by external cues (the condensation, the bird) rather than protagonist agency. While the closure (transformation into the source) is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of friction or causal reversals makes the ending feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of steps toward a guaranteed success, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The paragraph beginning "The method worked like this" interrupts the scene with an expository manual on the magic system, deflating the dramatic flow. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis (endurance), which fits the lens but lands with low dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is sturdy, and the shift to the captain’s perspective effectively delivers closure and context. The resolution relies heavily on the "magic key" nature of the vial, which solves the central puzzle instantly upon use, slightly softening the mechanical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.3)
    Causality operates on dream logic where obstacles vanish via magic objects (lattice opens door) rather than character ingenuity. The closure is marred by a direct physical contradiction: the protagonist "left the lighthouse" and "walked away," yet lines later "vanished into the copperlight," breaking the ending's coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: problem presented, solution offered, solution executed, problem solved. There is no meaningful escalation or complication; the ghost appears conveniently to explain the exact mechanics required. While the closure (orchard blooming) is legible, it lacks a felt cost or a "because/therefore" chain that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary and passive occurrence (sleepwalking) rather than active, causal scene work. There is no on-page struggle, tightening of options, or felt cost; the resolution is achieved through magical convenience and declared success rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on summary and coincidence (finding the missing wedge via "purposeful wandering") rather than causal consequence or pressure. The orientation is clear, but the closure—fixing the sundial to fix the heart—is a soft reset that feels unearned because the obstacle was removed by luck rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (Situational lens) with a legible beginning, middle, and end, but the causality is low-friction. The "pigeon" vs. "Mira" mechanics create a momentary confusion in the delivery logic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of a significant obstacle or "felt cost" makes the resolution feel like a standard checklist completion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "observe-then-act" sequence that lacks Causal friction; information is delivered via magical convenience (the cloth revealing text) rather than active extraction. The ending functions as a prologue to a larger story rather than a resolution of the scene’s specific tension. The mechanism of the "adjacent possibilities" is named but operates as a black box rather than a constraint affecting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure where the protagonist arrives, performs a task, and leaves, lacking a significant causal turn or complication. The climax relies on the magical extraction of the apology ("rose from my throat, unplanned") rather than an active, difficult choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure, utilizing the anesthetic slide to fluidly overlay memory and present, is expertly handled. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration ("I kept your number too"), though the mechanism of deciphering a physical cast on a surgical gurney relies on a slightly convenient ambiguity between hallucination and reality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure where every action immediately succeeds: she goes, finds the art, identifies it, projects it, and crowds appear. The closure is an example of "symmetric satisfaction"—a purely additive happy ending with no "felt cost" or sacrifice. The fog "respecting the moment" removes the central obstacle exactly when it matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulation-based structure driven by magical assertion rather than causal logic. The closure—a realization about wonder—feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacle or dilemma to reach it. The "pause between question and reply" is used as a structural crutch rather than an organic turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax relies on the antagonists' convenient incompetence; the auditors accept a vague botanical excuse instantly, dissolving tension without an earned turn or tactical trade-off. While the closure (planting the seed) lands, the lack of a visible price paid makes the victory feel hollow and the narrative arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story operates as a synopsis or fable summary rather than a dramatized narrative, spanning "centuries" without a focused scene. Causality is weak, as the central problem (war) resolves immediately via montage ("One by one, they laid down their coral spears") without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative structure is linear and repetitive, lacking causal friction or genuine obstacles; the inciting incident leads immediately to a solution without complication. While a closure of "Earned Stasis" is attempted, the cost is declared in summary ("preservation was a quiet, lonely act") rather than paid through a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible, and the closure is distinct (reconciliation via shared work). However, the central waiting beat is passive ("She slept in her chair"), and the resolution comes without meaningful complication or resistance from the partner.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience (finding the chain and envelope together) and a scientifically implausible decoding method (reading pressure ridges in old adhesive) to resolve the plot. The climax is summarized in a speech that instantly fixes a deep societal divide without resistance, lacking earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a true inciting incident or causal progression. The resolution is asserted ("story of his life rewrote itself") rather than arrived at through action; the ending functions as a soft reset without the required legible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causal tension; obstacles dissolve immediately upon approach, creating a "walkthrough" feel rather than a plot. Closure is weak, relying on a summarizing tell about the character becoming a legend rather than a decisive on-page change with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from investigation to realization to decision within a single scene. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (transformation/death), satisfying the rubric. Causality is somewhat soft, relying on the magical properties of the feather ("ghost-maps") rather than mechanical pressure, but it holds under a Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a convenient "conjecture" to bridge the inciting incident and the solution, bypassing necessary investigation or causal linkage. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction without struggle, and the closure relies on a stated epiphany rather than an earned shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear series of successes without setbacks, leading to a closure that lacks visible or felt cost. While the causal chains are clear, the absence of a "Decisive Change" or difficult trade-off renders the ending an example of unearned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot operates on dream logic where symbolic actions (tattooing) solve physical constraints (roots) without established causal rules. The inciting incident and resolution feel arbitrary, driven by the necessity of including prompt phrases rather than organic narrative pressure. While a change occurs, the lack of defined stakes or mechanical logic makes the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a functional drive lens; it is a static vignette where observation leads to epiphany without causal friction or consequence. Closure relies on a summary explanation of future days ("In the days that followed...") rather than a dramatized scene resolution with felt cost. The promised "shift" acts as a false stake that never arrives to test the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear if static retrospective structure (arrival, memory, ritual, departure). The closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing (reframing the burden as purpose), but the scene lacks active present-tense causality; the protagonist moves through a ritual without encountering unexpected obstacles or costs in the *now*. Orientation and flashbacks are handled smoothly, but the drive is low.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent under an accumulative lens, leading to a strong conceptual repricing (hope as maintenance rather than a permanent fix). However, the central turn relies on magical assertion—the pattern simply "revealing itself"—rather than dramatized causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the ending dissolves into a broad summary ("Mira spent weeks," "reclamation movement") that diffuses tension. The inciting incident works, but the resolution lacks a specific, dramatized scene of confrontation or high-cost decision, relying instead on a montage-like conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure loops awkwardly, with paragraph 5 summarizing the magic system's logic after it has already been demonstrated in paragraph 4. Closure is soft, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to anchor the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a magical solution to resolve the central conflict; the "faint hum" and "glow" of the clipboard compel the generals' cooperation, bypassing human agency. This "deus ex machina" resolution dissolves the tension without an earned turning point. The inciting incident (the challenge) and climax (the signing) occur without logical causal linkage beyond the magic prop.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative abandons the scene to summarize future events ("Vesper's foundation would later fund..."), diffusing tension and breaking the drive lens. The ending lacks immediate on-page closure, relying instead on a resume-style epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot relies on a "magic key" resolution where a dance instantly solves systemic oppression without logical causality or escalation. The ending negates the stated stakes; the protagonist fears being "hunted" but is immediately celebrated as a savior, rendering the cost illusory and the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing the single scene to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the audience's reality. The "un-telling" mechanic provides a strong causal spine that lands a legible conceptual cost at closure as the characters confront their stripped-down truths.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and structural integrity is strong, moving effectively from ritual to disruption to resolution. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the signal succeeds—lands with appropriate conceptual weight. However, the logic relies heavily on the "esoteric" premise established early; the connection between the moth wing's vibration and the monarch's arrival pushes the boundaries of causal credibility, even for a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The plot relies heavily on the coincidence that the found card's grid "perfectly" matches the ceremonial rope, removing necessary friction or problem-solving. While the Resonant Reconfiguration closure is valid, the lack of causal difficulty makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a "Deus Ex Somnia" to resolve the central mystery; the dream fox explicitly explaining the theme and the directive's true purpose breaks causal tension. While the physical closure (leaving the bunker) is a decisive change, the bridge leading to it is constructed of exposition rather than dramatic action. The orientation and setup are strong, but the climax dissolves into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the Conceptual Repricing at closure (magic reconfigured as math/pattern) lands clearly. However, the reliance on summary to bridge the "seven nights" and "tenth day" creates a distance that softens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where the pin conveniently reappears and solves the antagonist's resentment without requiring a difficult choice or sacrifice from Mira. Causality is soft; the mechanism of healing is asserted rather than earned through struggle. While the closure (Elara's dissolution) is legible, the lack of on-page cost weakens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear process (idea, tool, method, success) with minimal resistance; the "dream slipped" obstacle is resolved quickly by breathing, lacking a substantive "try/fail" cycle. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the landscape, but the victory feels inevitable rather than earned against significant odds. The pacing is steady but lacks a sharp causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on convenience (the daughter appearing exactly at the climax) and concludes with a summary that spans years, dissipating the scene's tension. The ending resolves via a "tied up with a bow" explanation rather than a dramatized closure unit with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from setup to resolution, with a distinct Conceptual Repricing at the closure (orchard as graveyard). The "bathroom breakthrough" functions as the turning point, though it feels slightly convenient that the solution simply "arrives" once he enters the room. The logic of the shell and the inheritance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where obstacles are dissolved by convenient solutions immediately upon presentation. Closure is a soft reset that returns to the status quo without a felt price or decisive change in the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is a linear "lock-and-key" fetch quest where the prop effortlessly solves the only obstacle. The closure (staying on the ship) feels disconnected from the low-stakes exploration that preceded it, lacking causal necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative moves linearly with low causal density; pivotal moments rely on intuitive leaps ("Touching it, she understood") rather than earned deduction. The resolution—erasing a student's death to tidy the timeline—lowers the stakes by removing the historical cost rather than confronting it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central turning point relies on a convenient memory ("recalled the ancient technique") to solve the problem immediately after the first failure, lacking causal tension or sacrifice. While the ending attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration by accepting the cycle, the path to it is linear and lacks the friction required for a satisfying narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative suffers from "symmetric satisfaction," where the resolution perfectly solves all problems without cost or sacrifice. The arrival of the three travelers—conveniently possessing exactly the skills needed—undercuts the causality by providing a *deus ex machina* reward rather than an earned outcome. The closure lacks the required "felt cost," reading more like a solved equation than a dramatic event.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from observation to crisis to resolution, but the pivot relies on the convenient discovery of a journal entry that explicitly articulates the lesson. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, but the causal chain leading to it is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual, and succeeds without obstruction. The resolution (lighting the fire to cure hopelessness) is a "soft reset" that resolves the abstract conflict instantly. Closure lacks a felt cost; the burning of the rag is a resource expenditure, not a personal price, resulting in symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story operates as a static vignette rather than a causal narrative; the inciting incident (brother leaving) is resolved through environmental contemplation with no pressure forcing a decision. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply feels better because the tide rose, lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The "pause" absorbs all tension, preventing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative structure is iterative and summary-heavy ("She began to collect," "She learned") rather than a dramatized scene with a specific inciting incident and climax. The closure relies on a stated realization ("understood that the bunker was not a prison") that feels unearned by the low-stakes action of the preceding climb.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is distinct—giving away the heirloom vial is a decisive action with inherent cost. However, the path to this closure is linear and lacks causal complication; the resolution is achieved through environmental manipulation rather than a difficult choice made under pressure, making the ending feel more like a foregone conclusion than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot follows a linear fetch-quest structure with convenient logic—specifically the "peeling paint" mechanic, which feels gamified rather than narrative. Closure is a "task complete" beat that resolves the cycle without a felt cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative structure is circular and lacks causal tension; the protagonist's transition from bridge-burner to bridge-builder feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming resistance. The "fading threshold" is a static condition that fails to exert escalating pressure on the scene's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on a deus ex machina (instructional texts) to resolve the central problem without creating a credible obstacle. Closure fails the cost requirement; the owner's immediate acceptance of the unauthorized experiment removes the necessary consequence for the protagonist's risk.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The structure is legible as a single scene, but causality relies on "magic feather" logic where the object solves the problem instantly. Closure is a soft reset ("not a burden but a gift") that dissolves stakes rather than resolving them with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on significant unearned knowledge leaps; Aldric instantly intuits that the theater program is a "map of forgotten patterns" without any deductive process or trial. The progression is linear and lacks resistance; obstacles are removed immediately by magic rather than character agency, resulting in a low-stakes sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to span weeks ("Three days," "A month later") rather than a continuous dramatized scene, violating scope defaults. The resolution arrives passively via a letter, solving the tension without protagonist agency or on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot relies on dream logic (puddles reflecting a map, a phone booth key opening a high-tech server) that clashes with the sci-fi frame. The protagonist's escape—the most dangerous moment—is resolved off-screen, undercutting the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist arrives, succeeds immediately, and leaves. There is no orientation regarding the stakes (why the "old world" waking matters), and the closure lacks a felt cost, relying on asserted "heaviness" that isn't dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative follows a frictionless linear path where every obstacle resolves immediately upon contact (dust touches seed, seed opens; needle prods leaf, map appears). The closure is an unearned "fix-it" ending that resolves the global stakes without causality, difficulty, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, dreamlike logic suitable for a fable, moving from inciting mystery to resolution. However, the climax relies on a "magic key" solution (jamming the compass into the slot) which resolves the mechanical problem too conveniently, lacking a sense of tactical difficulty or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building pressure through the ritual until a valid Conceptual Repricing occurs at the closure. The decision to stop searching feels earned by the internal shift, though the causal mechanics of the "factually mystical" magic remain largely lyrical rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong causal arc from the specific harp technique to the climax; the closure is excellent, using the "click" of the tooth and vial to physicalize the internal integration (Resonant Reconfiguration).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly, but the progression relies on linear association (walking triggers memory) rather than causal choices. The pacing is functional, though the "epiphany walk" structure is standard and lacks a decisive, costly turning point beyond mental endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on extreme coincidence—the specific key (fragment) and lock (painting) are found adjacent in a vast market—and the "Wise Old Mentor" trope removes all investigative friction. Closure is achieved through a "magic key" solution rather than causal effort, resulting in a frictionless narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is robust, moving logically from the cessation of the buzz to the dust analysis and finally to the discovery of the barrels. The closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the repairman redefines his job from fixing lifts to carrying testimony. However, the initial hook (a rusted lift tripping a sensor three towns over) is a loose causal link that relies slightly too much on narrative convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is rigorous within the story's surreal logic: the translation of sound to light directly causes the structural rupture. The closure is a definitive "Resonant Reconfiguration," fundamentally altering the world state with clear, dramatized steps. The pacing manages the transition from stasis to destruction smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central conflict, condensing the "archaeological dispute" into exposition rather than a dramatized exchange. The climax hinges on a convenient, unexplained magical effect (temporal energies printing a poem on a cloth) rather than a causal outgrowth of the established rules. While the ending achieves a form of Earned Stasis, the path there lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal path, but the ending triggers a "soft reset" (anti-pattern) where the protagonist's physical cost (the rust) vanishes instantly ("joints healed... skin became smooth"). This negates the "felt cost" required for high-band closure, rendering the victory schematic rather than earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.1)
    The timeline jump ("For three days, she prepared") deflates the urgency established by the "morning after" opening. The "psychometry" vision serves as an exposition dump to resolve the mystery instantly, reducing narrative drive. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the build-up lacks causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where a magical object conveniently resolves the central puzzle without complication. The closure relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—a tidy connection made—without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist. The inciting incident (GPS failure) is a minor inconvenience that never generates true causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative violates the short story scope by summarizing a year-long quest into a synopsis-like flow rather than dramatizing a specific scene or distinct shards. The climax relies on a convenient magical coincidence (the window depicting the protagonist herself) to resolve the central mystery, lacking earned causality. The pacing is rushed, skimming over the journey to deliver an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.2)
    The piece is a narrative summary spanning weeks rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short-story scope. The resolution relies on a massive coincidence (the antagonist's grandfather took the exact photo needed), which shortcuts the conflict and creates a convenient, unearned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story relies on a summary montage ("In the weeks that followed") to resolve the plot, skipping the necessary dramatization of the rebuilding process. The climax is a low-stakes ritual that transitions immediately into a "tell" ending, lacking a decisive scene with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc operates on poetic logic where the water ritual instantly converts a threat of doom into a benign map; while atmospherically consistent, this dissolves the central tension without a earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of events with low causal density; obstacles are resolved immediately by magic without complication. The ending dissolves into meta-commentary ("The story ends, but...") rather than delivering a diegetic closure unit with felt cost. The "choice" to sustain the vortex is a false dilemma (survival vs. death) that generates no narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The wet glue on the bell rope acts as an excellent physical constraint that sharpens the choice between the mechanical siren and patience. The closure is decisive and earned, landing on a meaningful refusal to act.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative fails the fundamental scope requirement of a short story, functioning instead as a lifetime synopsis spanning "ages," "cycles," and "years later." There is no scenic causality or orientation in a specific moment; events are linked by "and then" progression without immediate pressure. Closure is a summarized legacy rather than a resolved beat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative reads as a summary or outline rather than a dramatized scene. Causality is driven by authorial assertion ("She realized the covenant was broken") rather than logical progression or on-page discovery. The ending is a soft resolution where the ghost simply dissolves without a decisive, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic ("simply was there") to bridge the gap to the climax, bypassing causal difficulty. The mechanics of the garage sale messages are conceptually hazy, softening the drive of the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.4)
    A fatal continuity error breaks causality: the feather is explicitly left on a driftwood shrine in paragraph 3, yet appears in the notebook in paragraphs 6 and 9. The narrative is a static loop lacking genuine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a six-month summary montage rather than a focused scene, violating the scope default and reducing immediate tension. The narrative arc is linear and low-resistance, and the resolution (transcendence) feels convenient given the lack of on-page obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: arrival, ascent, discovery, and confirmation, lacking any meaningful reversal or obstacle. Closure offers &quot;symmetric satisfaction&quot;—a perfect validation of her theory with no felt or conceptual cost—resulting in a tidy, explain-everything ending that deflates tension. The plot moves on rails without testing the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The ending dissolves into summary ("In the weeks that followed") rather than landing on a decisive, dramatized moment of closure. The linear, procedural structure lacks causal complications; the ritual simply succeeds step-by-step.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The plot moves cleanly from discovery to resolution, but the central mechanism—a wax-preserved leaf functioning as a physical key for a high-tech hatch—strains plausibility with video-game logic. The journey segment is summarized rather than dramatized, skipping the potential for rising action in the wasteland.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality collapses under physical impossibilities; sketching on paper with graphite in a vacuum and "drifting" as viable space travel shatter verisimilitude. The compass functioning as a magical moral guide ("aligning to my own resolve") breaks the sci-fi frame. Closure is achieved through a suicide-equivalent leap framed unconvincingly as exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where obstacles are resolved immediately via convenient memories of the master rather than active struggle. The resolution—a simple placement of the lid—feels unearned because the protagonist faces no risk of failure. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" that ties everything up perfectly without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative functions as a linear procedural (walk pattern -> release prisoner) with dream-logic causality that lacks mechanical resistance. Closure is achieved via a decision to stay, but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The "nomadic penumbra" functions as a convenient backstory device rather than an active causal force.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on convenience; the feather is a *deus ex machina* retrieved from a pocket without prior establishment. The climax suffers from a soft reset where the "warning" (thunder) is retroactively revealed to be benign ("a drum calling her"), removing the cost of the protagonist's risky decision. Closure is attained, but the lack of negative consequence for ignoring the warning creates a "have your cake and eat it too" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic causality where "fidgeting" with a tapestry magically produces a physical key that resolves the central conflict (the frozen time) instantly. This lack of resistance or mechanical rigor robs the climax of tension; the solution feels unearned because the protagonist faces no setbacks or forced trade-offs during the "winnowing" process.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.0)
    The climax relies on a "soft reset" where a symbolic gesture (throwing pigment) instantly overturns a century-old systemic ritual without struggle or causal logic. The resolution shifts into summary to explain away the conflict, resulting in a fable-like ending that lacks earned narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident and rising action tracking the repair procedure against the failing workshop. Closure is decisive and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), as Elara physically adapts to the environment. The causal logic operates on a mythic/metaphorical level (repairing the statue stabilizes the room) which fits the genre perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure lacks genuine causal pressure; the inciting incident (mirror crack) and the climax (finding the oasis) are linked by weak motivation and coincidence. The "wrong turn" functions as a deus ex machina that removes the obstacle of navigation rather than complicating it. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply decides he is free, with no visible cost or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and compact, successfully utilizing a hybrid lens where emotional intent manifests as physical reality. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the resolution comes somewhat easily via the "magic object" mechanic rather than prolonged struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a mechanical accumulation of steps without a decisive turning point or reversal; success is achieved through labor rather than a difficult choice. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the sister returns simply because the machine worked—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to earn the result.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a summary spanning days ("One dawn," "In the days that followed") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default. Closure is a synopsis of a new status quo rather than an on-page decisive change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot suffers from a significant causality break regarding the core premise. The protagonist reads "final moments" from the object, implying the owner's death, yet the owner sends a letter the very next morning; this contradiction undermines the stakes and logic. The ending relies on this convenient coincidence rather than a result of the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting glimmer to the decisive threshold crossing without wandering. Closure is definite and resonant; the protagonist steps into a new state of being, paying the cost of his previous existence, which satisfies the drive lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, successfully passing the Orientation Test and delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the ending relies heavily on expository summary ("She understood now," "mystery was finally unraveled") to explain the transformation rather than allowing the final image to carry the causal load.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: desire > action > success. There is no obstacle, complication, or cost to force a deviation or deepening of the plan. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the initial goal is met exactly as intended, lacking the required friction or Decisive Change that alters the character's standing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative operates on dream logic, which excuses physical causality breaks, but the transition to "soaring" feels like a convenient escape from pressure rather than an earned turn. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is low as the protagonist simply transcends the conflict through a sudden new ability.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a coherent situational arc leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts translation over restoration. However, the causality rests on a convenient "wise mentor" speech that resolves the central tension intellectually, bypassing a more dramatic demonstration of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure that lacks a decisive turning point or causal complication. The ending acts as a "soft reset," resolving the internal conflict through magic ("ink... turning the scar into a luminous tale") without a visible cost or consequence. The Drive Lens is weak, as the story drifts from anxiety to resolution without significant opposition or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible, but the reliance on the "induced current" device as a pivot point feels like a contrived plot convenience. The causal chain holds, but the mechanism for the turning point weakens the sense of human agency.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent mythic logic, moving from stasis to a journey and finally to a transformative closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The "hiccup" provides a functional frame for the transition, and the merging with the dictionary offers a legible ending state. However, the causality is dream-like and soft, relying on the "voice" of the arbitration to spur the climax rather than active protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative arc is repetitive, cycling through the same actions (squinting, turning the key) without escalating causal pressure. Closure is achieved through a stated realization rather than a dramatized consequence of the protagonist's actions. The orientation is clear, but the causality is symbolic and lacks a felt cost for the "magical" operation of the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from detection to confrontation to resolution. The closure (reprogramming the system) is a valid Conceptual Repricing that alters the farm's rules, though the "decision that would revolutionize everything" relies on hyperbolic narration rather than dramatized scale.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on brittle contrivances, particularly the implausible link between a decades-old lantern and current subway graffiti. The resolution—finding a pristine secret room in a public library by simply pushing a panel—lacks earned causality or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.0)
    The loop mechanism is handled in summary rather than experienced as a pressure cooker, reducing the weight of "eternity." The resolution is mechanically convenient—shattering the disc immediately solves the problem with only superficial physical cost (cut palms).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality breaks at the resolution; a private act of journaling inexplicably triggers a public social phenomenon ("Whispers spread"). The ending relies on unearned magical healing rather than logical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a synopsis of events rather than a dramatized story, lacking scene-level causality or orientation. The ending is an "explain-everything" summary of future legends, failing to provide a distinct closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration) with paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist moves from entry to epiphany without encountering genuine obstacles or setbacks. The "hinge of night" constellation shift arrives conveniently to facilitate the climax rather than pressuring a decision. Closure is present as a realization, but the ease of access undermines its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and relies on a magical tool that functions without unforeseen consequences; the "ripples" mentioned are benign. Closure is a soft landing (Earned Stasis) where the cost is merely the depletion of a resource, lacking deeper narrative bite.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (changing the view of his isolation), but the narrative arc is linear and lacks causal friction. The arrival of the mentor figure resolves the central problem with minimal cost or complication, making the resolution feel unearned despite the clear structure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a synopsis-like montage ("Kael worked for weeks") rather than a continuous scene, violating the scope defaults. A critical causality break undermines the ending: Kael creates the cipher in the murals but then "follows" the coordinates hidden within their own creation as if discovering them for the first time.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting preparation to the climactic transformation. The closure is a definitive "Resonant Reconfiguration," where the protagonist alters the fundamental state of his existence with a clear, high cost (loss of physical form). The logic of the sound garden supports this surreal ending without breaking suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The resolution relies on a "technobabble" mechanic (a tuning fork transmitting a complex spoken sentence through disconnected containers) that breaks verisimilitude in a grounded setting. Additionally, the closure lacks a "visible or felt cost," resolving the conflict too neatly via this magic trick.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with low causal density; the Guardian acts, and the child receives, with no obstacles or complications. The closure feels unearned because the "healing" faces no resistance. The repetition of prompt phrases creates a circular, static feel rather than forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("In the days that followed") rather than dramatized scene work, violating the scope required for short fiction. The ending creates a soft reset without a decisive, high-cost moment of change on the page; events unfold linearly but lack causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a linear chain of magical coincidences (finding the scrimshaw, the whale's call, the island's appearance) rather than causal agency. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist escapes to a fantasy existence without paying a visible or felt cost for abandoning her previous life.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    The structure relies heavily on habitual summary ("Each evening," "would whittle") which distances the reader from the climax. The key decision—reporting the dog—is filtered through a future-tense intention ("would report") rather than a present-tense action, deflating the immediate tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative acts as a linear procession of sensory details without causal turns, obstacles, or structural tension. Closure is a soft fade-out ("walked on") that lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or any paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=2.5)
    A severe causality break undermines the plot: Elara is shown finding the reed tongue at a market and holding it in her palm to demonstrate, yet she subsequently asks Dorian to trade it to her in the deal. The narrative lacks resistance; the transaction is smooth and pre-ordained without the requisite cost or complication for a closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the lens proves its worth. The pacing is steady, though the transition to the climax relies heavily on the sudden success of the experiment rather than a complex causal chain of trials.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure violates the short-story scope by summarizing "three eternities" and a journey across "seventeen systems" rather than grounding the conflict in a specific, pressurized scene. The result is a fable-like synopsis where major turns (teaching the star, the woman's arrival) happen in montage, lacking immediate causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a static setup to a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the client’s worldview is successfully reconfigured. The closure is legible and conceptually earned, though the causal pressure is relatively low. The orientation is established quickly, anchoring the abstract cartomancy in the physical loft space effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative arc is functional and complete, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the resolution relies on a convenient internal technique ("letting her thoughts wander") that dissolves the established threat of "corruption" without exacting a visible cost or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear but relies on "dream logic" where the river stone interacts with digital footage without established causal grounding. The resolution acts as a convenient soft reset, and the connection between the stone and the shadow feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and linear, moving logically from the destruction of the lies (brochures) to the reconstruction of truth (care and mission statement). The closure—Earned Stasis—is excellent: she accepts the impending legal penalty (answering the door) but reconfigures the terms by fighting for the animals' location. The cost is palpable and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative structure relies on linear sequencing ("and then") rather than causal pressure, with the protagonist moved by external directions (the telepathic fern) rather than agency. The resolution—touching a glowing stone that instantly grants the desired epiphany—functions as a deus ex machina, creating a "magic feather" ending devoid of earned cost or decisive change. The Orientation Test is strained by the collision of clinical (anesthesia) and fantasy (stone tower, ancient tunnels) elements without a coherent grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a strong Accumulative logic, building density through the incubation process until the Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. The transition from the film strip's specific content to the broader revelation of the theater as a storage unit is handled with smooth, dream-logic causality. Closure is decisive and earned, with Mira physically absorbing the archive, a transformation that carries legible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where success is immediate and unearned; the protagonist travels, performs a ritual, and is cured without setbacks or failure. The resolution relies on a "dream ex machina" where the problem is solved during rest, offering no causal logic or on-page cost for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (planting the archive, dissolving into the charm) is a clear Decisive Change. However, the inciting incident ("Tonight, something was wrong") is slightly convenient, and the "dune grew legs" moment at the end risks reading as an unearned whimsical shift rather than a logical progression of the established surreal rules.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where "translocation" and "probable miracles" erase causal friction and travel constraints. The ending offers a symmetric satisfaction ("back beneath the piston-tree") without a felt price, relying on a soft reset where problems are solved by realization rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.9)
    The plot advances via convenience—the ferry appears immediately when needed—rather than causality. Closure is achieved through a low-stakes reunion where the dog is simply waiting, missing the required "visible or felt cost" for a Resolving Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive from the discovery of the stain to the decisive act of reporting it. The closure is a strong Decisive Change that validates the cost of vigilance. The flashback section is substantial (bordering on 30%) but remains anchored to the stairs she climbs, successfully avoiding a momentum kill.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear plan-execution path with no deviations or earned complications. Vael conveniently finding the specific "slender volume bound in green leather" relies on coincidence rather than causal pressure, and the resolution lacks a tangible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path from discovery to realization, but the "delayed revelation" is delivered through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The causality is intellectual—she reads data and understands—lacking a visceral turning point or a moment where the outcome was in doubt. Closure is achieved, but it feels like a low-stakes conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution relies on unexplained "dream logic" where singing at stones activates solar-powered tech. The closure is distinct but lacks a felt cost; the victory feels inevitable rather than earned by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a substantial flashback block to establish the inciting logic (decoding the kite), which drains present-moment momentum. The climax is mechanically smooth but lacks friction—the guard waves her through—and the resolution relies on summary ("Word spread through the settlement") rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory of healing with no meaningful setbacks, complications, or pressure to test the protagonist's resolve. While the physical smoothing of the photograph offers a legible closure image, the lack of an on-page obstacle makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative relies on a significant causality break in the middle: "Elara understood: she was not in a library but a pivot point." This unearned epiphany resolves the mystery and dictates the solution without an on-page experimental process or external clue. While the closure (the healed box, the return to painting) is resonant, the bridge to get there relies on convenient intuition rather than demonstrated cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative fails to achieve closure, ending on a "soft reset" that promises future action ("Tomorrow, he would spill ink again") rather than delivering a Decisive Change or realization on the page. Causality is thin; the ink’s ability to physically erase a drone is treated as a magical convenience without established ground rules, breaking suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pacing collapses at the end; the Council issues denials and resignations in the few minutes Elara stands in the corridor, which breaks temporal verisimilitude. The pneumatic tube mechanism relying on a "ceremonial fountain" strains plausibility within the high-tech server farm setting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.6)
    The structure is episodic, with the stranger's visit and the dust storm functioning as disconnected vignettes rather than a causal chain. Closure is an Earned Stasis that feels low-stakes because the "chaos outside" never truly breaches the dome to force a decisive change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a celestial inciting incident to a ritualistic climax and a resonant release (Earned Stasis). The causality holds under a Situational/Ritual lens, and the closure lands with the legible cost of "residual grief" left in the spike.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and logical, moving clearly from the inciting call to the decisive intervention. The use of "proof by contradiction" as a plot device to generate the counter-memo provides a satisfying intellectual climax. Closure is strong, with the "orbits of regret" decaying as a result of her action, offering a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is coherent and the closure is decisive, effectively utilizing the "future self" loop to resolve the plot. While the mechanism relies heavily on dream logic—tattooing amber to rewrite firmware—it holds together within the established tone. The cost is tangible (loss of the lab), satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with a legible beginning, middle, and end that adheres to the Situational lens. However, the resolution relies on a "video game" logic where the protagonist receives explicit instructions from an object ("Complete the circle...") and simply executes them to solve the problem. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands, the lack of causal friction or complications makes the trajectory feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events with no meaningful obstacle or decisive turning point. While closure is technically present (the renaming), it feels inevitable rather than earned, as there is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on asserted magical conveniences ("fractured timeline," "synesthetic gift") to resolve the central problem, lacking grounded causality. A significant tense consistency error ("The ripples intertwine past and present... She stood") breaks the timeline logic and immersion. The resolution feels unearned, as the coin-flip mechanic instantly fixes the actress's deep despair.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot follows a linear "techno-magic" causality where a rock creates a resonance map of nanotech without explanation, friction, or failure. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—total success with no cost or complication—rendering the closure unearned. The narrative lacks a drive lens, relying instead on a sequence of convenient interactions that solve the problem instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure is linear and tour-like, lacking causal friction; events proceed because the theme dictates them (fossil floats -> shows vision -> epiphany), not through character agency. Closure is a soft conceptual shift ("become the voice") without a legible cost or paid price on the page, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt consequence. The ending feels predetermined and unearned by the preceding low-stakes exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure relies on the summary of decades ("spent decades cataloging") rather than a distinct, pressure-filled scene, which distances the reader from the causal chain. While the closure lands a clear conceptual shift, the narrative reads more like a synopsis of a life than a dramatized event with immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path with a legible beginning, middle, and end; the excavation of the codes provides a tangible beat of action. Closure is distinct (passport received, news of Elena), though the resolution feels slightly convenient, lacking a complicating cost or twist to elevate the stakes beyond the expected transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from waiting to arrival to resolution, but it lacks Causal or Situational pressure; the outcome feels predetermined by the backstory rather than the scene's action. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the touching needles), but the connection to the cessation of the gutters feels coincidental and magical rather than earned by the protagonist's agency in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of impressions without causal friction or meaningful obstacles; the realization about the oasis arrives instantly upon touching a hive, bypassing the need for investigation or struggle. Closure is legible as a conceptual repricing, but the lack of resistance makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal obstacles or meaningful deviations; the protagonist desires to plant seeds and simply does so without external opposition or internal cost. Closure is achieved through a thematic summary rather than a dramatic turn, resulting in a "perfect" ending where the environment cooperates fully, stripping the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative functions as a summary or montage rather than a causal scene; time is compressed ("One morning," "She sits for hours") without a specific anchor. The transformation is achieved through realization and assertion ("She decides to become a bridge") rather than a forced choice with consequences. Closure is a thematic statement rather than a structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence (finds nest, decides on art, succeeds immediately) with no causal friction or stakes. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction where a complex emotional void is filled by a convenient, frictionless project. The ending is a soft reset that clears the "restlessness" without requiring a difficult trade-off or genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the inciting incident relies on a significant knowledge leap where Mara interprets complex alien intent (&quot;tricksters embedding infra-linguistic commands&quot;) instantly from a spectrogram. This shortcuts the investigative process. The closure effectively resolves the immediate plot while acknowledging the lingering human cost, satisfying the requirements of a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot follows a linear, low-resistance path where obstacles are removed by a magic tool; the ending breaks continuity by having Elara exit the church, then immediately interact with the Architect's chamber interior without transition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain breaks at the climax. It is unclear how a portrait of the victim reveals she was exactly "two inches taller," or how that victim height discrepancy specifically incriminates the vendor based on his height and shadows. The detective logic leaps over the necessary evidence, making the resolution feel convenient rather than deduced.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is solid: the discovery of the journals leads directly to the confrontation and revelation. Closure is decisive and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), with the visual proof silencing the antagonist. A slight "tech-magic" feel regarding how inputting coordinates physically clears the view prevents a higher score, but the arc holds well.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is broken by the "Morse code of the wind," a massive convenience that resolves the search without protagonist agency or struggle. The closure relies on a "magic box" discovery that perfectly answers the protagonist's needs without exacting any cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a low-resistance causal chain where abstract symbols ("territorial markers") and a single object resolve a life-altering conflict without debate or complication. The resolution is symbolic rather than dramatized, lacking the necessary friction to earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (redefining the inscriptions as shared burdens). The causality relies on the somewhat magical "trance" mechanic to bridge the gap between data and meaning, which feels slightly convenient, but the closure lands with a clear reconfiguration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    The inciting incident ("magic trick") clashes tonally with the high-fantasy druidic ritual, reading like a checklist item rather than organic causality. The climax relies on a tool (the seed) that solves the central problem mechanically without exacting the promised price or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the solution is handed to the protagonist by an apparition rather than earned through deduction or sacrifice. The resolution depends on a convenient explainer monologue from the ancestor, and the closure is summarized in an abstract realization ("Elara understood now") rather than a demonstrated change.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a solid Causal trajectory with a clear transaction and closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the aftermath—where she feels her sister's pulse and love despite surrendering the memories required to define that bond—slightly blurs the established cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the closure lacks visible or felt cost; the protagonist simply decides to change her perspective in a "soft reset." Causality is weak; the interaction with Dale exerts minimal pressure and does not force the subsequent epiphany, which occurs in a vacuum of internal monologue. The resolution feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path ("fix-it" plot) without a significant reversal or deepening of the dilemma mid-scene. The resolution relies on a rapid intellectual breakthrough ("thinking through analogy") and a convenient magical application (singing star-iron) rather than a causal chain involving sacrifice or error. The closure is a soft reset—the city is saved and she gains wisdom—lacking a distinct, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is excellent, establishing the loop and stakes immediately. The arc is clean, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hybrid creel) that physically alters the archive's status quo. The closure is strong, though the linear progression from discovery to resolution feels somewhat inevitable rather than fraught with the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the objects and location conveniently solve a massive societal problem (town trauma) without commensurate effort or cost from the protagonist. The connection between a sealed deep-earth cave and residential ventilation systems strains credibility even within a magical realist frame, and the ending lacks a felt price for the breach of protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure lacks genuine causality; the climax relies on a *deus ex machina* where random bathroom graffiti resolves the protagonist's deep-seated trauma instantly. There is no resistance to this advice, and the "bridge collapse" backstory provides unearned gravity that the present action does not support. Closure is achieved without a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" sequencing and coincidence rather than causality; the watch opens via a timer ("sudden click") rather than the protagonist's skill, and the convenient arrival of the second letter dictates the climax, stripping the resolution of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers from a significant causality break at the climax; a ruthless biotech empire's envoy accepting the excuse that the violin is "too fragile" strains plausibility and resolves the conflict without earned cost. The plot progression relies heavily on the "coffee stain" divination as a shortcut for narrative direction rather than organic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is a linear procedural that moves smoothly from anticipation to execution to closure. While the "Earned Stasis" ending works for the tone, the plot lacks a decisive turning point or causality beyond the successful completion of a task; the outcome feels inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure holds firmly, transitioning from reflection to ritual action. The closure—shifting from sacred wine to simple jam—is a strong Conceptual Repricing that grounds the high-concept magic in a tangible, earned reality, effectively paying off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.0)
    Causality is soft; the central obstacle (the chimes) is bypassed not by the protagonist's ingenuity or sacrifice, but because the keeper verbally provides the solution. The closure is a "realization" moment that feels unearned, as the shift from doubt to certainty happens without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is a linear procession toward a foregone conclusion, lacking causal turns or obstacles that force the protagonist to adapt. The pivotal realization ("She realized... the vanishing she taught was her own") is delivered as internal monologue rather than sparked by external pressure. Closure creates a conceptual shift, but the lack of resistance makes the ending feel like a scheduled ritual rather than a narrative climax.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path to success with no felt cost at closure; the protagonist gets exactly what she wants by doing exactly what she intended. Additionally, the premise prohibits movement as sacrilege yet relies on the physical act of skimming stones, creating an unaddressed logical gap.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, with the method of "mist walking" effectively setting up the surrender required for the final refusal. The scene anchor ("mountain's base") arrives slightly late after a block of summary, but the closure is decisive and carries a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality collapses when Elias descends into a sunken ship without breathing gear and reads a "bloated" book underwater. This violation of basic physics acts as a convenient magical shortcut rather than a surrealist rule established early on. The resolution is unearned; the environment simply hands him the answer because he showed up.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is coherent under a Situational/Hybrid lens, successfully utilizing the "backwards prophecy" to drive a valid Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The transition from decision-maker to "the decision itself" provides a legible resolution, though the internal logic operates on dream-logic rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is solid, utilizing an Accumulative drive that pivots to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The discovery of the recordings is a slightly convenient inciting incident, but the closure mechanism—crystallizing the void—lands with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path ("arrive, fix, strike, succeed") with no meaningful turns or reversals. The closure is a classic "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the magic simply fixes the problem without an on-page cost or trade-off. The "imbalance" is resolved by correct technique rather than narrative struggle, resulting in a soft reset of the world state.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience and logic breaks, particularly the "sodden stack of photographs" surviving in mud for decades with images clear enough to identify specific colors, which shatters physical plausibility. The protagonist's recovery of the truth relies on a sudden, convenient memory of a "secret night" rather than active investigation, bypassing narrative tension. Closure is technically present but unearned, as the decision to "expunge" the report carries no visible cost or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the crystal shattering and the alchemist's readiness). However, the progression is linear and lacks mechanical resistance; the solution (observe birds, add violet) works perfectly on the first try, creating a sense of symmetric satisfaction that reduces narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path without significant complication or causal density. The resolution (using a parachute buckle to lock a digital tether) lacks logical grounding, reading as a "magic object" fix. Closure is present but feels unearned due to the lack of visible, escalated obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is strong, with a clear inciting incident (timeline fracture) and a resonant decisive change at closure (reintegration). The pacing is tight, and the causality holds well under a hybrid lens where metaphysical actions have physical consequences. The resolution feels inevitable yet surprising in its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative fails to establish a functional causal chain; the seed arrives and sprouts within hours, breaking verisimilitude without establishing a magical reality. Closure is absent; the ending offers no Decisive Change with visible cost, merely a progression of happy events (planting -> sprouting) that lacks narrative tension or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality is solid: Eleanor's action directly drives the resolution. However, the path to closure is linear with minimal friction; the obstacle (balancing the wind to avoid madness) is overcome instantly with a "gentle" adjustment. The "magic system" solves the central problem a bit too conveniently, lacking a moment of doubt or high-risk trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative operates under a Situational lens, effectively tracking an internal shift in perspective (Conceptual Repricing: "Home was a way of waiting"). However, the external causality is soft; the door's appearance at the end feels like a convenient reward for the internal realization rather than a necessary consequence of action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and logical under a Causal lens. The "penny drops" realization directly motivates the decisive action (breaking the crozier), leading to a transformed state (Resonant Reconfiguration) with clear cost (loss of the heirloom, creation of undeath). The closure is earned and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, utilizing the "discarding assumptions" prompt to drive a tangible Resonant Reconfiguration of the tower's purpose. The closure lands with visible cost—the destruction of her equipment—and creates a legible "after" state where the city’s function is fundamentally inverted.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural track ("radio crackled," "glass warmed," "ferry shuddered") with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The resolution relies on a technobabble convenience (weaving spirals with a radio) that feels like a magic wand rather than a causal outcome of the protagonist's struggle. The ending is a soft reset without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean causal chain where a specific mistake (forcing a connection) triggers a proportionate disaster and a distinct Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands effectively, recontextualizing the protagonist's goal from weaving threads to inhabiting a medium with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from a physical lesson to a philosophical reconfiguration. The Conceptual Repricing at the end—where rust becomes a star map—is effective and provides a legible closure with conceptual cost (accepting the "folded horizon").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.4)
    The central twist relies on a causality break: the hearing aid decodes the specific name "Lila," but this is later dismissed as the pulse of an unrelated dying man without explanation. The inciting incident (the photo/name) and the climax (the heart attack) are linked only by coincidence, not organic narrative drive. Closure is weak, relying on a rapid, low-stakes rescue by arriving paramedics.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clear, utilizing the tidal window as an effective ticking clock to force closure. However, the mechanics of the "phase transition" blur the line between physical drainage and metaphysical state change, creating slight orientation drag regarding the facility's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path (enter, perform ritual, receive wisdom, leave) without significant causal friction or earned turning points. The resolution relies on dream logic—pouring ink and touching a shard instantly fixes complex code—which bypasses the need for genuine problem-solving or consequence. Closure is present but feels unearned, as the "cost" of the transformation is not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a convenient arrival of the birds to solve the central problem, followed by a summary-heavy epilogue ("In the years that followed") that narrates the cost rather than dramatizing the transformation in scene. This distance dilutes the immediate impact of the closure, turning a potential resonant reconfiguration into a reported event.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative proceeds through dream logic rather than causality; events happen because the prompt requires them, not because of character agency. The ending functions as a "soft reset" where magic dissolves the conflict without cost or earned resolution. There is no structural tension, merely a linear sequence of escalating supernatural effects leading to an unearned apotheosis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the locust discovery to the climax of confrontation with the clocktower. The resolution leans on a "magic surge" that mitigates the physical cost of turning to stone a bit too conveniently, but the closure—the orchard waking—is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot relies on a convenience tool (the storm bottle) that negates the central obstacle (drones) without requiring ingenuity or sacrifice in the moment. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect delivery with no complication—resulting in low narrative tension. The linear structure lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest driven by coincidence (the "wrong turn") and resolved by magical convenience. The narrative lacks a causal chain where the protagonist's decisions create consequences; instead, the restoration is an automatic result of fitting the fragment, with no obstacles or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.6)
    The plot follows a linear, procedural path ("and then" sequencing) with no significant obstacles or causal turns. The cyclical "reset" ending—returning to the desk with no lasting change—undercuts the sense of closure or cost required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a complete fable structure with valid Conceptual Repricing closure (understanding release). However, causality is weak; the protagonist follows written instructions found in the atlas and on the palette ("illuminate what flees," "what is captured must also be released") rather than forcing a turn through agency, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magical logic is coherent and the ritual provides a clear structure for the scene. Closure is achieved for the client, though the "locking/unlocking" mechanic feels slightly convenient, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on synopsis-style summary ("three nights," "three weeks") rather than a continuous scene, violating the scope default and flattening tension. The central obstacle (August growth vs. October timeframe) is resolved via a montage, bypassing the immediate causal pressure required for a short story. The closure lands on a realization, but the path to it feels like an outline rather than a lived event.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is legible as Earned Stasis with a clear cost (remaining in exile) that validates the "reversible exile" premise. The causal link between the tea leaf geometry and the annotation is established early and pays off, holding the drive lens effectively through the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The pivotal climax is glossed over in summary ("worked for seven days") rather than dramatized in scene; the resolution feels inevitable and linear, lacking the causal friction or possibility of failure required for narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from the inciting interaction with the net to a transformative closure (the pearl). The "Resonant Reconfiguration" is excellent: the net is empty, and the silence has been transmuted into a tangible object (pearl) with a new purpose. The magical logic of the "prism sanctuary" holds up well under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, relying on "and then" sequencing and teleportation ("She traveled to the remote site"). The resolution hinges on convenient, undramatized access to resources ("remembered the silent video footage") rather than causal effort. The closure is mechanically tidy but unearned by the preceding low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, albeit static, accumulative structure that successfully creates a vignette of realization. However, the closure relies on a purely internal "Conceptual Repricing" (reclassifying grief as memory) that feels linearly derived from observation rather than forged through narrative pressure or unexpected turns.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative structure relies on a linear sequence of magical successes without causal resistance; the balladeer sings, the ghost responds, and the problem resolves immediately. The transition to the scribe in the city feels like a disconnected epilogue rather than a cohesive second shard, diffusing the closure’s impact. The ending offers a standard ascension trope without a felt cost or decisive change in the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on a massive coincidence: the sun breaks through "perpetual cloud cover" at the exact moment and altitude required for the optical effect to work, rendering the resolution luck-based rather than earned. Additionally, the narrative claims the diary unfolds in "reverse chronology" (Floor 7) but then culminates in the "final entry" and death diagnosis at the top (Floor 9), which describes a standard forward chronology; this logic error confuses the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Textural lens, focusing on the archive of memory. Closure is achieved, but the arrival of the specific "acceptance" cloud exactly 17 years later relies heavily on convenient coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a dream-like lyric logic that blurs causality; how a coin mapping a face helps paint a sky is metaphorically asserted but causally opaque. The ending relies on a metaphysical escape ("sky had already escaped") that lacks physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is severely strained by the contrivance of a dusty hopscotch board on an airship deck containing secret celestial coordinates. The narrative lacks a genuine crisis or closure cost, relying on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where success is immediate and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where solutions (prophecy scraps, the gear's fit) appear immediately when needed without causal friction. Closure is a tidy restoration of the status quo achieved without visible cost or complication, rendering the stakes negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on summary over "years" rather than a dramatized scene with specific time-bound stakes. The resolution is linear and obstacle-free (ghost provides answer -> success) with no causal complications or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual progression ("Processional") that lacks causal friction or setbacks. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and the imagery is consistent, the plot feels like a checklist of actions performed without obstacle. The logic is dream-associative, which works for the genre, but the lack of resistance flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain (nut placement -> shadow -> bird response) is inventive and rigorously executed, grounding the "magic" in a tangible process. Closure creates a strong Earned Stasis: the travelers are saved, but Elara remains trapped in her cycle, paying the cost of invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a standard epiphany arc where looking at nature immediately solves a complex scientific and emotional problem, lacking causal grit. The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction," tying up every thread without a felt cost or distinct trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative structure is competent, stacking interactions to build a portrait of the trade before the final reflection. Closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the vendor re-commits to her role. The narrative arc is legible, though the pacing is uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from the woman's arrival to the analysis of the memory and the final decision. Closure is distinct and resonant; the "sandpapering" metaphor is subverted meaningfully to create a lasting reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative structure suffers from severe compression and summary, reading more like a fable's synopsis than a dramatized scene. The transition from the private tower climb to a town-wide festival is jarring and lacks causal grounding on the page. The resolution—social division solved instantly by a clock mechanism—is unearned and lacks the required cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension progression where the "risk" (modifier becomes modified) is accepted without hesitation or visible struggle. The closure feels like a soft reset—waking to a "more possible world"—rather than a reconfiguration earned through a hard choice or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot relies heavily on the convenient coincidence that the specific hour of inversion "was now" immediately upon discovery. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where the protagonist succeeds completely, returning to safety with the prize and no felt cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of discovery and enactment without a causal turn, complication, or felt cost. The ending lacks a valid closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost); the transition from silence to music is an unearned happening rather than a resolution of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (dropping the stone) is physically distinct, but the causal mechanism of the "nexus" communication is asserted rather than earned. The connection between the physical act and the student's understanding relies on "magical" convenience rather than grounded logic.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot hinges on a causality break where tuning a radio frequency physically unlocks a mechanical steel clasp, functioning as unexplained magic rather than grounded narrative logic. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" with a sermonizing conclusion that ties up loose ends without narrative struggle. The closure lacks a felt cost, resolving the central tension through a convenient, metaphorical deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates as a summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, spanning multiple days without a cohesive time window. Causality is linear and frictionless: Elias wants a potion, makes it immediately, and it works perfectly on the first try with no cost or complication. The ending is a generalized "happily ever after" summary that lacks a distinct closure unit or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot relies on convenient magical guidance to solve the navigational challenge, bypassing causal friction. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction—she gains the seed, the wisdom, and a healed artifact—without the required felt or conceptual cost to anchor the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with no significant obstacles or reversals to test the protagonist. Closure—deciding to publish findings—is a low-stakes administrative resolution that lacks the required visible or felt cost to mark a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear "just-so" sequence where a magical ritual succeeds instantly without complication or causal friction. The connection between the bell ringer and the distant sculptor is asserted by fiat rather than narrative logic. The ending provides resolution without an earned decisive change or visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc relies on a convenient magical intervention—the flute’s vision—to resolve the central conflict, bypassing genuine narrative tension. A glaring tense error at the climactic moment ("he sat... and uncase") disrupts the causal chain and pulls the reader out of the scene. The closure is a "soft reset" where the character simply decides to feel differently, lacking a tangible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, following a clear triadic pattern (mathematician, poet, self/stars) that leads to closure. The causality is governed by fable logic, which works for the genre, though the ending relies on a conceptual realization rather than a forced decision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure collapses near the end with a severe text loop: the paragraph describing the "silver-leafed tree" and travelers listening to the story appears twice verbatim (paragraphs 21 and 26). This unintentional repetition disrupts the timeline and breaks the reading experience. While the closure of "myth-making" is legible, the execution is fatally flawed by this structural glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from hypothesis to breakthrough, utilizing the prompt's structural beats effectively. However, the climax relies on a high-context supernatural delivery—the frost literally spelling out a sentence—which resolves the tension too neatly for a literary piece. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing of her motivation, but the inciting discovery feels somewhat convenient after &quot;fourteen failures.&quot;

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is resonant, with the silence transforming from "raveling" to "whole" at a legible cost. However, the pivotal turn relies on a heavy coincidence—finding a puzzle piece of her own face in a random rummage sale box—which resolves the central mystery too conveniently and undercuts the earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on significant convenience (finding the silk immediately in a grandfather’s chest) and summarizes pivotal beats (three days of research, the journey to the mine) rather than staging them. The causal chain is intact, but the reliance on summary for the middle section reduces narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenient knowledge downloads to resolve the conflict; Lira instantly understands the shard's history, the rift's mechanics, and the specific weaving technique required without trial or error. The closure is a mechanical task completion followed by a summary of acceptance, lacking a felt causal chain or genuine complication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.7)
    Causality is severely damaged by the sequence of events; the urgency of a dead lamp is ignored to facilitate a slow-paced walk to a cairn. The narrative pauses the crisis without cost or explanation, breaking the logical drive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, fable-like structure where obstacles are overcome immediately by the protagonist's omnipotent magic, resulting in zero narrative tension. Causality is soft; the ship is saved because she shouts a thematic statement, not through a tactical maneuver or trade-off. The inciting incident (discovering her power) leads too smoothly to the climax without a "try-fail" cycle or deepening complication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina; the stranger arrives, explains the theme, and vanishes, resolving the central mystery without protagonist effort. The inciting incident and resolution are situational rather than causal, lacking a tightening of options or meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and convenience—finding the exact key, it healing automatically, the map appearing—rather than causal linkages. Closure is a "happy ending" realization that requires no felt or conceptual cost from the protagonist, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with price. The "approaching storm" is a false clock that exerts no actual pressure on the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story suffers a fatal structural failure: it narrates the complete arc (singing, dawn, memory loss) and then restarts at paragraph five to retell the same events with slightly different phrasing. This narrative loop destroys closure, causality, and pacing, rendering the piece unpublishable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    The climax relies on a convenient magical object ("The Wisdom of Error" book) introduced late to provide the solution, functioning as a deus ex machina. The resolution—discovering she was a member all along—lowers the stakes effectively to zero, creating a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the cost of the decision is negated by the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary ("She'd been tending... They'd watched") to establish the climax, reducing immediate tension. While the closure—a ritualistic crumbling of bread—offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of active obstacles makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative tracks a linear repair sequence, but the resolution relies on arbitrary "technobabble" (tuning frequencies) that lacks established causal logic. Closure is a soft reset achieved without visible cost or meaningful consequence, failing to land a resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality collapses in the climax; it is implausible that the narrator's antique family heirloom unlocks a beam where a stranger (who arrived minutes ago) hid his device. Furthermore, the ending claims the "truce of hush remained intact," yet the text explicitly states the stranger's deal was "sealed," creating a contradiction between the event and the claimed resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear situational lens, building a convergence of phenomena into a coherent closure. The giving of the ring functions as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, symbolizing the abandonment of mechanical measurement for organic trust. Causality is tight, with the waiting and sensing beats leading naturally to the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality relies on video-game logic (finding a note in a sealed rock chamber) and convenient puzzle-solving that deflates tension. The closure creates a change but lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, resolving the issue too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience, specifically the discovery of the map under floorboards and the protagonist finding her own specific tape in a city-wide archive without effort. The narrative arc is linear and lacks resistance; the journey feels like a fable where obstacles dissolve upon arrival rather than a causal chain of earned events.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and iterative time ("Villagers... would climb") for the middle third, delaying the specific inciting incident (the child's arrival). While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of preservation to transmission) lands effectively, the structural weight of the exposition drags on the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration, resolving the internal static through the external act of burning. However, the mechanism allowing the climax—a convenient "loophole" in the safety protocols caused by the magnetic interference—weakens the causal chain. The protagonist exploits a coincidence rather than overcoming the obstacle through ingenuity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on coincidence (Samir’s arrival) and a timeline-breaking resolution where letters in a window instantly stop bulldozers. The ending is a summarized "soft reset" that resolves complex legal/construction issues with sentimental magic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.4)
    The resolution relies on a significant causality break: the AI inexplicably interprets an interpretative dance of a circuit diagram as a legitimate maintenance protocol to unlock doors, which reads as "magic hacking." The ending dissolves into an "explain-everything" summary ("Later, when the rescue team found...") rather than an on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story violates the scope default by relying on heavy summary to bridge multiple locations and timeframes (afternoon, night, home) within a short word count. Closure acts as a "soft reset," resolving the memory loss completely without a legible cost or consequence to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is clean and linear, effectively translating the abstract magic system into concrete beats (folding, placing, silencing). The closure is strong, utilizing a "Conceptual Repricing" where the brook's innocence is bought at the cost of its warning, satisfying the prompt's closure requirement with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to initiation to inheritance. However, the inciting threat (renovation) appears late to force a climax, and the mechanism of the ending (meteors triggering the seal's power) leans on unearned magical realism rather than established logic. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the middle section relies too heavily on iterative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear objective and deadline (dawn). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the memory becomes a bridge, but the mechanism of the "archive" action remains vague, relying on abstract descriptions of "resonance" rather than concrete causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path with no causal obstacles or meaningful resistance. The resolution relies on a convenient, unearned mechanism (the hidden compartment and the "unlinking") and a summarized aftermath ("tyrant's power waned") rather than an on-page dramatic climax. The orientation is clear, but the lack of struggle renders the "plot" a mere sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a linear list of abstract realizations that lack on-page evidence or causal weight, particularly the "conspiracy" which is stated but never manifested. The closure is a shift in stance, but without a concrete antagonist or visible cost, the journey feels like a sequence of assertions rather than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply walks to the goal and retrieves it. Causality breaks at the end when a physical object materializes from a dream, undermining the "wreck-diver" reality established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on summary and broad time jumps ("The next evening," "In the days that followed") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short-story scope defaults. The transition from stirring air metaphorically to serving a literal cup of tea breaks physical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the anomaly in the roots to the realization and final decision. Closure is a functional "Charged Poise" ending (the decision to confront), though the investigative middle relies heavily on summary to bridge the gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong, and the pressure builds logically to the transmission. However, the ending relies on a summary epilogue ("In the weeks that followed...") to validate the stakes, which diffuses the immediate tension of the "charged poise" created by the enforcers' imminent arrival. The shift from scene to legend-summary weakens the on-page closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path under an Accumulative lens, moving from discovery to accumulation to release. While the Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (becoming a conduit) is legible, the lack of causal friction or setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The "cost" is abstract ("weight... new kind of poverty") rather than a concrete price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causality is clean and the narrative arc is structurally sound with no major breaks. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) works well, though the solution (humming at 7.8 Hz) feels like a competence-based procedural fix rather than a hard-won victory born of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The resolution relies on a "magic button" mechanism where a single magnetic pulse instantly neutralizes a tyrant's power without complication or cost. The plot lacks a "Because/Therefore" causal chain of struggle; the obstacle (enforcers) is dismissed as incompetent, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative logic suffers from the forced inclusion of the lantern; using a 19th-century oil lamp for modern forensic investigation breaks verisimilitude and investigator competence. Additionally, the timeline implied by finding an Underground Railroad symbol in a standard subway tunnel (typically 20th century) is confusing and unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the chaplain's purpose. However, the resolution relies on a linear "sage teaches lesson" structure rather than active protagonist agency or causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative operates as a summary or montage ("Throughout the evolution," "Zephyr continued her rounds") rather than a distinct scene with causal tension. The lack of a specific, anchored moment of crisis dilutes the closure, making the ending feel like an inevitable progression rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully dramatized scene, relying heavily on summary ("She began to suspect," "She decided to lie"). The central "heist" action—forging a token to bypass AI—lacks granular causality or resistance, resolving instantly without suspense. The pacing is rushed, compressing a complex investigation into a linear checklist of events.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (problem -> vintage store mirror for instruction -> application) with convenient progression. The solution (blood equals empathy) is acquired without trial or error, and the "vintage store" feels like an arbitrary pocket dimension rather than an integrated part of the world's causality. Closure lands, but the path is low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, moving from seeking death to accepting renewal via the volunteer work. However, the pivot relies heavily on pathetic fallacy (wind "whispering," earth "exhaling") rather than causal agency, making the epiphany feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (finds letter, walks, writes, buries) with weak causal linkage; the protagonist encounters no resistance. The closure (burying the vial) is a symbolic gesture that feels performative rather than earned, as it resolves no prior established tension. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the progression lacks density or a deepening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative is a linear checklist of successful actions without causal friction or deviation. Closure is achieved through a mechanical completion of the task, lacking any felt cost or reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the scope default for short fiction by offering a generalized summary of years ("As seasons turned," "Years later") rather than a dramatized scene or shard. There is no specific inciting incident or climax; the narrative is a synopsis of a process that lacks a distinct closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration) anchored in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure relies on a heavy summary bridge ("Elias spent weeks") between the inciting moment and the climax, which saps some immediacy from the investigation phase. However, the closure is excellent: a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist re-prices "silence" and acts with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative loop is coherent, and the breaking of the chalk provides a solid closure beat (Decisive Change/Earned Stasis). However, the causality is driven by atmospheric swelling rather than strict pressure, and the ending relies partly on a summarized lesson rather than the dramatic action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where adjusting a clock gear physically stabilizes a planet's crust, breaking causal credibility even within a fable frame. The resolution is a "soft reset" that dissolves the threat instantly without cost or difficulty, rendering the closure unearned and mechanically convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on "magic art therapy" causality where humming and a vinyl shard instantly resolve deep familial trauma. The inciting incident (blood work) sets a clock, but the climax (reconciliation) arrives without obstacle or tactical variation. The closure is unearned, offering a "flawless goodbye" that feels like a sentimental wish-fulfillment rather than a narrative outcome derived from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a linear task-completion structure (problem, hypothesis, convenient key, fix) without a Decisive Change or felt cost. The climax resolves mechanically with the protagonist succeeding on the first try, leading to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending that lacks narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight; the inciting tooth leads directly to the confrontation and resolution. The backstory is integrated efficiently without stalling the present action. Closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's life work.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary and span rather than scene, violating the short story scope by covering a lifetime of influence rather than a specific causal moment. The progression is linear and frictionless ("Determined, she settled... Gradually... She imagined... Rising..."), lacking the causal pressure or decision points required for a dramatic arc. Closure is a thematic summary of a legacy rather than a structural event on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.0)
    The scene is a static vignette with an Accumulative lens that lacks a decisive turn; the resolution (opening the sanctuary) feels like a mental drift rather than a choice forced by on-page pressure. Closure lands without a visible cost to her solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the surreal logic holds together, leading to a decisive closure where the shell is sacrificed. However, the progression is linear and episodic, lacking significant causal complications or unexpected turns.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with no meaningful obstacles or reversals ("symmetric satisfaction"). The resolution—singing a song to instantly fix the vine—lacks causal complexity or sacrifice. The ending is a "soft reset" that restores the status quo without exacting a visible price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a straight line (ritual -> map -> destination) with no complications, setbacks, or causal turns that alter options. The ending relies on a convenient discovery (a cabin with a fire already lit) that resolves the tension without cost, creating a "symmetric satisfaction" that feels structurally flat. Closure is achieved, but it lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and logical, following a clear problem-solution structure that leads to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The inciting incident (silence) and climax (releasing the echoes) are causally linked, though the linear progression lacks significant setbacks or complications to test the design.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a tight, ritualistic structure that adheres perfectly to the Accumulative lens, building pressure through specific burdens. The closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the realization that the prison is a loom recontextualizes the entire setting and history with earned conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear ritualistic structure (carving while kettle boils), but the causality is somewhat magical, relying on the "crystallized time" device to force resolution. Closure is distinct but feels mechanically derived from the prompt's magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a soft reset ending; the ghost appears and verbally resolves the central conflict ("You cannot undo... but you can weave"), which the protagonist accepts without struggle or sacrifice. The logic is dream-like and lacks a causal spine; the transition from scavenging to "weaving" is a gift received, not a change earned through pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative reads as a summary montage ("First... Next...") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. The timeline is implausibly compressed—major civil engineering feats occur in summary moments—and the resolution offers total success without a legible cost or decisive turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, utilizing a clear Accumulative logic that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The dismantling of the chronometer effectively creates a "before and after" state with a legible emotional cost (the abandoned dream).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient tools (the sundial pointing to the door) rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. The closure—finding a map and smiling—lacks the required felt or conceptual cost to give the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation structure: arrival, process, success. While the closure (recovering the wisp-grass method) offers a clear conceptual repricing of the rope as an archive, the lack of significant obstacles or reversals flattens the arc. The "error" in the knot is resolved too quickly to generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events ("and then") without causal linkage or rising pressure; the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual, and leaves without facing an obstacle. Closure relies on a summarized realization ("She understood that healing was...") rather than a decisive change or earned reconfiguration of the status quo. The ending explains the meaning of the story instead of allowing the action to resolve the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from discovery to creation to consequence, and the closure lands on a resonant conceptual reconfiguration (the hybrid bird). However, the middle section relies heavily on summary ("Over weeks, he hypothesized..."), skipping the active struggle of the assembly process. The pacing is rushed, compressing what should be a complex trial into a quick synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks causal resistance; the bird's injury is resolved instantly with a symbolic gesture, breaking biological plausibility and narrative tension. Closure is a "soft reset" where the problem vanishes without cost or trade-off. The sequence is purely linear and anecdotal, lacking a decisive turning point that alters the character's options.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a *deus ex machina* (magical breadcrumbs) to strip the protagonist of navigational agency during the rising action. Closure is a costless success state; the "defiant hush" asserts a resolution that was not earned through on-page struggle, sacrifice, or a genuine test of the protagonist's skills.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" resolution where the gear explicitly delivers the thematic answer ("Light... was not flame but information preserved") rather than the protagonist earning it through struggle. The solution (shifting from question to lullaby) happens instantly upon touching the artifact, bypassing the necessary causal friction of the seven failed generations.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure relies on synopsis rather than scenic dramatization, summarizing a six-week migration period instead of inhabiting a decisive moment. This violates the short story scope (defaulting to a "tell" summary of a longer arc) and dilutes the tension of the inciting incident and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is impeccable; the discovery of the rake handle leads directly to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the town's history. The "earth shifted" twist serves as a decisive change that logically recontextualizes the central conflict without needing a dialogue scene. The closure lands with a tangible shift in method (winding with "measured care") that proves the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence but lacks causal pressure or a decisive turning point; the "decoding" is handled through magical assertion rather than process. Closure acts as a soft reset—the gardener simply leaves—without a visible or felt cost to options or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies heavily on summary to bypass the actual drama; the inciting problem (quartz failing) and the climax (convincing the elders) are handled with minimal resistance. The ending dissolves into a "years later" synopsis ("Over the following years..."), robbing the narrative of a concrete, charged closure moment where cost is paid in the present tense. The pacing is flat, moving from exposition to solution without a palpable rise in narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal turn or genuine escalation; potential obstacles like "prying eyes" are mentioned but never manifest as scene pressure. The ending relies on a summarizing "And so" fairy-tale sign-off rather than a dramatized closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.9)
    Closure is severely undercut by the protagonist's decision to "return the next day," which acts as a soft reset and negates the cost of the scene. The narrative loop (rocking chair stops, sways, stops) and meta-commentary ("the story is incomplete") prevent a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The ending dissolves tension rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setup and orientation are strong, but the closure suffers from a causality break. The patrolman's decision to spare Malach solely due to "confusion" and "absence of sentiment" contradicts the established high stakes (executions of archivists) and feels like a convenient soft reset to ensure survival.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative spans decades in a short space, relying on broad summary rather than a cohesive scene with causal linkage. The central conflict resolves instantly upon instruction (the students simply stop hating and start singing), bypassing the necessary escalation and turning points of a dramatic plot. The structure resembles a fable more than a short story, lacking a distinct closure unit with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where a magical alignment solves the central problem without cost or complication. The "Order" is a paper tiger that exerts no pressure, leading to an "explain-everything" ending that offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive change with felt consequences. Causality is driven by convenient magic rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    Closure relies on a "soft reset" where a mechanical/biological infrastructure collapse is resolved by a thematic abstraction ("wonder") rather than established story logic. The resolution lacks a legible cost; the protagonist simply plugs in a found object to instantly fix the city-wide crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear list of successful actions without resistance, complication, or causal tightening. Closure is a summary of total success ("story... becomes a legend") without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that carries a felt price. The plot lacks a turning point, as the protagonist's plan works perfectly from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from the diver's arrival to Petra's decision. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (the city's purpose recontextualized). The "decades later" time jump, however, dissipates the immediate scene tension and summarizes the consequences rather than keeping the pressure in the dramatic present.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the discovery of the rupture providing a clear climax and the refusal creating a strong Earned Stasis closure. The causality of the dice leading to the anomaly is established early, and the cost of the final choice—infinite endurance over illusory release—is felt and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a "just-so" structure where intent leads immediately to success without obstacle or cost. The ending relies on a summarized "ripple effect" of kindness rather than a specific, dramatized closure unit with visible price. The lack of resistance from the world flattens causality into a fable-like progression.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis of a story rather than a scene, relying on "and then" sequencing without causal density. The resolution is a convenience-based magic fix where the bread ritual works instantly without established logic or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" arc where a magical tool solves the problem without complication or sacrifice. The closure is a purely positive restoration lacking the required felt or conceptual cost, as the protagonist succeeds completely and leaves unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot progression is mechanical and linear, resembling a video-game fetch quest where the solution is provided by an external voice exactly when needed. The climax relies on a supplied riddle rather than an earned insight, reducing the satisfaction of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear process (Ritual leads to Resolution) with a legible resonant reconfiguration at the closure. However, the sequence lacks causal tightening or significant obstacles; the magic system functions perfectly without adaptation or cost. The ending reconfigures the storm into a partner, but the absence of a felt price limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure creates a clean line of tension from discovery to confrontation, with a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The deductive leap connecting the whistle’s crack to the turtles’ breathing rhythm relies heavily on the premise’s magic system ("pattern-language"), but causality holds firm within that logic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene constraint with a summary epilogue ("Back at the university") that resolves all tension without on-page cost, violating the closure requirement. The discovery of the letter is convenient, lacking causal resistance or earned complication.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is complete and the closure—lying to the council to buy time—is a valid Resisive Change with professional cost. However, the central turning point relies on a convenient download of inspiration (the method arriving instantly) rather than causal derivation from the scene's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is weak; the closure relies on a coincidence (power returning) rather than protagonist agency. Spatial logic is contradictory: the library is "submerged" yet the protagonist walks dry with a lantern, and the tech level clashes (oil lamps vs. fluorescent tubes).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic (the Senbazuru trope), leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the shadow's return feels like a transactional reward for completing a quota rather than a consequence of a decisive, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear situational drive (the cooling cycle) creating functional pressure. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael accepts her role as witness. The cause-and-effect chain is intact, though the "science" of the solution functions more as magic than a constraint that forces a hard tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (search, solve, retrieve) with clear orientation but lacks a decisive change or felt cost. The resolution—instant success and universal recognition—feels unearned, offering symmetric satisfaction without the friction or sacrifice required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence; the protagonist simply "uncovers" the crucial plaque immediately upon looking, which lacks causal logic or earned discovery. The closure (Decisive Change) feels mechanical and unearned because the inciting obstacle was resolved by luck rather than agency. The narrative structure is a linear sequence of events without "because/therefore" linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking a decisive turn or causal friction; the exchange proceeds exactly as planned without obstacle. While the scene is coherent, the ending offers a "soft reset" where trust is reaffirmed without a visible price paid on the page. The closure relies on abstract reflection rather than a change in the state of affairs driven by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the release of the compass. However, the compass spinning to point directly at the grave is a convenience that borders on magical realism, slightly undermining the grounded, tactile tone established earlier. The causality of the journey is intact, but the resolution feels slightly aided by external forces rather than purely internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.7)
    Causality is driven by extreme convenience; finding a newspaper with plot-crucial exposition in a "sterile" memory-wipe room breaks logical consistency. The progression relies on video-game logic (find item, unlock path) rather than narrative consequence. Closure is a stated resolution without earned cost or logical grounding in the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence lacking causal friction or unexpected turns; the outcome feels predetermined by the premise. While a closure unit (transformation/reunion) occurs, the lack of obstacles or rising tension makes the resolution feel unearned, functioning more as a checklist completion than a narrative argument.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ritualistic progression provides a solid structure, moving from inquiry to resolution. However, the climax relies on an external force ("voice like wind") explicitly explaining the lesson to the protagonist, rather than forcing her to earn the realization through the pressure of the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is strong, with a clear causal chain leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist achieves the goal but renounces the reward. The closure is definitive and costly. A slight deduction for the "method came to her in a dream" beat, which feels like a convenient shortcut to connect the clues rather than active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central causal chain (stone→pig→bird→fish→filter) relies on a contrived Rube Goldberg mechanism that strains credibility, particularly the confusing logic of how clogging a poison filter immediately results in "clean water." Furthermore, the narrative breaks the single-scene constraint with an omniscient intrusion ("Kael knew none of this") to explain off-stage events, severing the reader's connection to the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is complete, but the central mechanism contains a causality break. The setup establishes manual latches requiring individual oiling, but the climax relies on a centralized pneumatic system to unlock them all simultaneously, a convenience that contradicts the established world-building. Additionally, the puzzle logic—a quill holder's gears acting as a cipher for a sundial—strains credibility without better foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the story suffers from a significant "physics amnesia" break in causality: the premise states friction has vanished, yet Elara stands on a bluff and places rocks without sliding. This fundamental contradiction between the world rules and the physical action undermines the logic of the entire scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot hinges on a fragile contrivance: the protagonist waiting for a specific storm intensity to read a letter he wrote himself, with no explanation for why he doesn't remember its contents. The climax is mechanical (timer clicks, envelope opens) rather than driven by a hard choice. Closure is achieved through abstract realization rather than consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality fractures when the puzzle solution points to a distant location (willow grove) but triggers an immediate, unmotivated duel in the current location. The closure is a low-cost victory lap that resolves no established stake, failing to bridge the gap between the intellectual puzzle and the physical fight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story operates as a broad summary of a month-long period rather than a grounded scene, violating the scope requirements for immediate tension. Narrative summary ("Cora convinced him," "Inmates began to linger") replaces causal action, erasing the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience and dream logic; the protagonist finds a secret map in "cloud stuff" simply because he looks, and an airship is conveniently waiting without logistical friction. The narrative lacks a true crisis or turning point where a hard choice must be made; obstacles are bypassed instantly, rendering the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the inciting dream to the ridge climax with clear causality. Closure is excellent, utilizing Conceptual Repricing to reweight the nature of the island's reality with the cost of lingering uncertainty. A slight reliance on summary for the setup (the three nights of interpretation) prevents a higher score, but the ending lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on significant time jumps ("stayed... for three seasons," "Years later") to earn the resolution, bypassing the immediate causal pressure of the scene. The "years later" epilogue dissipates the tension of the specific encounter, resulting in a soft, summary-heavy structure. Closure is achieved through time dilation rather than a decisive on-page moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds density from silent hives to harp's note, with closure as Charged Poise: music echoes but "beekeeper's absence still hung" as felt cost in final image. One tightening via lens-melt ritual holds causality; orientation anchored early in grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds via because/therefore: yoyo mapping therefore timed spin at tide turn yields DC closure as stone cracks and light flares. Orientation anchors lighthouse/island/who immediately; cost legible in "hunger stone would eventually hunger again," shaping charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds: photo to clasp to funhouse to entities' confession as CR closure; cost legible in "some doors, once opened, could never be closed—but she now held the handle," reconfiguring survivor power.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound layers densify into shared storm resonance; Charged Poise closure in "true instrument... space between forecast and creation" lands with conceptual cost of perpetual drift, on-page legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to pool find; charged poise closure in geode-to-window refraction reconfigures unused potential into remembered witness with conceptual cost of unlived lives.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from drone trails to glyph to pinions; CR closure in "waveform of emotional resonance" reweights belonging with conceptual cost of truths "too bright for mortal eyes." Orientation anchored early via drone at observatory; one tightening via glyph suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sifting builds density to plaque (inciting tightening), yielding CR closure in decision to cease forging and final watch-hand image reweighting time/memory with conceptual cost of reclaimed narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to moon-crested exchange as Charged Poise RR, fragile trust reconfigured with doubt-cost in "heart a mixture of relief and lingering doubt." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via causeway reveal suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)

    Accumulative lens builds stitch-density to circuit completion and door-opening RR; "she turned back to the Compassion's Tear" lands stasis-choice with legible purpose-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to synchronized pulses and release, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where destitution reframes as readiness, cost legible in "emptiness ready for the next transformation."

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from reel search to arbor play; closure as Charged Poise in "silence was not empty, but full of the promise," cost legible in clock's silence and bled fingers. Orientation anchored early in station platform. One tightening via map discovery narrows to journey.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations/dreams builds to on-page Charged Poise closure ("ridge wakened... luminous doubt remained") with conceptual cost in petal's "humming a question mark"; orientation anchored early (ridge blooming, Kael's job).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual density deepens from compass pulse to needle settling under pot, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("severances heal... by growing around the wound") with felt emotional cost.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elena reframes noise as necessary, not eliminable, reweighting her life’s methodology at undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: water stains, mold, dust accrete until meaning flips; pattern is legible and coherent. Orientation is clear by line 11; no penalty. Transitions are smooth; one implicit cut from greenhouse to car to observatory stays within default. Persistent scaffold (“billion” twice, “pattern” four times) just avoids the −0.3 threshold, but the closure image is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused vessel glows, reweighting “purpose in the pauses” from abstract wish to tangible artifact. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—frost patterns and furnace echo layer until meaning crystallizes. Causality is intact: ledger → canyon → frost code → furnace → new vessel, each step because/therefore. Cost is felt—he leaves the furnace behind, carrying only the shard’s glow—yet the murder-attempt stakes evaporate once he reaches the canyon, trimming the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative pattern (silent fork → frost bloom → shared gaze) teaches itself by 30 % and lands a clean Charged Poise: Mara’s refusal to force sound crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; only minor causality gap—how heat-mapping mechanics travel from her retina to glass—is waved away by lyric premise and does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens glows, the keeper’s silhouette becomes architecture, and stillness is forever deferred—cost felt in “a silence that would never quite catch them.” Causality holds: package → lens → signals → lens rebuilt → eternal sentence. The library’s paradoxical topology is taught early and pays off in the final image. One minor lapse: “they told themselves they would leave” is interior summary just before the decisive rebuild; a micro-choice on that beat would have nailed causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as communal Charged Poise: the bell’s promise reweights the ridge into a sanctuary, and the cost—perpetual nightly risk under sanctions—is felt. Causal chain is light (bell → gather → story) but coherent under Accumulative lens; no prop or geography break. Orientation clear by 120 words; transitions legible in mosaic montage. Persistent constraint (sanctions) shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each breath-toggled refraction adds luminous density until the hidden chamber reveals sparks that reweight memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira exhales, chamber seals, love released—cost felt as “quiet resonance” and fog lifting to silver path. Orientation anchored by word 20 (“Mira stepped onto the viaduct”), pattern taught early, no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes the very texture she sought, the garden’s new ring. The halo fragment’s trap-linkage to prior generations is因果ally tight; each photograph surrendered literally feeds the roots, so her own surrender is inevitable. Accumulative lens holds—density of ghost summers increases until identity is the final medium exchanged. Felt cost is legible in “her memory becoming another layer of sap,” a single image that reweights all prior mappings.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chain still clinks, the ground is still dry, yet the seeds and the liberator’s stance reweight possibility. Causal linkage holds: arrow → chord → hatch; sentry confrontation → final key-press; each step forecloses retreat. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation serves the ending, so the Orientation Test is waived. One hairline slip: the wall’s collapse is described as a fait accompli rather than a felt physical cost, muting the decisive instant.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds from first sentence to last: every ash particle, salt-scabbed pane, and mitotic tick adds density until the forge’s cold ash reignites as voices. Closure is a Charged Poise: the device drifts down and the cleared channel of silence is imprinted—conceptual cost made undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the collected absences cohere into the “hollow note” that reweights all prior grief. Orientation is taught immediately by the cracked greenhouse panes pressing black water; the pattern pays off in the final aurora flicker.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece runs on Accumulative/Textural logic: each image-layer (sunset, moonbeams, floral code, painted door) thickens the atmosphere until the canvas breathes open. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the painted portal becomes a literal train door—so the before/after is legible and charged. Causality is poetic rather than strict, but the pattern is taught early and sustains the lens. The only drag: the floral code is revealed then instantly solved, so the middle beats feel like ornament rather than narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thaw/leak/glass gather intensifies density toward the bowl as Charged Poise. Orientation anchored by concrete stair, kiln, forty-two-percent gauge within 120 words; no debt. Causality preserved by parallel material thaw in dam/bookmark/heart. Closure: bookmark floats, crack widens, gauge ticks—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Persistent constraint (dam still dying) shapes decision to abandon bowl rather than take it. No artifact dulls final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: seashell → cast code → AI shutdown → hull crawl. Closure lands with Charged Poise—conch left as lullaby, cast in lap—felt cost visible. One scaffold loop (“rusted” x4) and late “vulnerability is power” tag keep it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of returning “ambered hush” images tightens the stake—the map is silence made visible—until the final beat where the traveler presses the parchment to his heart and steps into starless dark; cost is felt in the vanished star and the fort’s fade to silhouette. Orientation is lyric-delayed but taught by line 3 (“storm-tossed ridge”) and pays off at closure, so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: options narrow to “walk into the void” with the glowing map as compass; conceptual cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain holds: violin touch → loops → data amalgamation → conscious insight. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before word 120 and the final image—water ring on stone—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with conceptual cost: maintenance now equals meditation. One minor scaffold: “each loop was not a glitch but a deliberate stitch” is told, not traced through beat change.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: lens → doodles → numbers → timestamps → confession. Closure lands as Decisive Change with social cost (stagehand’s tears, audit promise). One slack link: the doodles’ “ambiguously clear” trait is asserted, never demonstrated blocking or enabling action, so the final beat relies on announced rather than dramatized clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral of marbles reweights the contract between gardener and garden with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—garden wilts because Silas wanes; heirs accept the living contract because the marbles make the bond legible. One minor scaffold: “polishing not just the marbles, but the bond” is abstract paraphrase within the climax beat, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost-pattern imagery, magnetic flux density, and holographic grids layer until the final violet flower reconfigures meaning. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the universe “pretending once more to be simple”—with undeniable ontic cost; the reader feels the before/after shift. Causality intact: every beat is therefore-linked (favor → access → lever → blackout → data dismissal). Orientation anchored by line 3; no seam artifacts; one minor loop—“holographic principles” twice in one sentence—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because she finds the program → deciphers → plays the sequence → ghost departs, equilibrium breaks, and she inherits the song. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “between spaces remained, now filled with possibility rather than mourning,” reweighting meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits haunting for uncertain artistry. Water-level imagery tracks spatially; lanterns, water, paper pulp evolve consistently. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 4—no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the smudged lily illustration thickens the pattern of guilt until the final reprise reweights “forgive” as the only measurable unit. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“mountain weather station”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Closure is a Charged Poise: the instruments still sway, but her stance crystallizes—she turns back to them, no longer compelled to resolve contradiction, cost paid in the quiet dissolve of auroral sorrow. No causal break; the blank margin is a pattern break that intensifies, not confuses, the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wheel’s counter-clockwise turn dissolves the ghost shift and transfers their weight into Elias’s memory—cost is the lifelong carriage of thirty-seven souls. Causal chain holds: bead count → valve twist → spectral release → vow to speak. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: radio psychic’s “truth has mass” drifts toward thematic echo, but it’s absorbed by the final image’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts the crumbling peace, the swan’s release is the visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern holds. Orientation anchors early; no penalty. The lens is coherent, yet the lack of a tightening beat keeps the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Amber twilight at 120-word mark cleanly anchors who/where/when; eclipse timetable supplies a built-in causal clock. The curl’s “pulse” and Eleanor’s spontaneous utterance of Mira’s mother’s name create a Decisive Change that reweights both women’s pasts with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (cedar, A-minor, roots) layers density until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Closure beat—“every life begins with a curl of wonder, and ends best when that wonder is returned”—lands the Conceptual Repricing with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each newly noticed diary layer thickens the pattern until the “migration” concept reweights the premise. Orientation is secure by line 5; causality is loose by design, yet the final image of Elias becoming “the walls’ newest story” delivers a Charged Poise that makes the cost legible. The only causality wobble is the off-stage arsonist whose motive remains vacuum, but this does not rupture closure. The tightening cadence from dusty discovery to sealed chamber satisfies the one-meaningful-deepening rule for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of specs → decoding microdots → writing targeted cookies → observable consequences. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing—she rewrites her own fortune, and the shell’s microdot spiral confirms the new rule-set with undeniable cost: her old self is gone. One transition (night→morning) is clean; time and space stay anchored. No orientation debt; the “open secret” idea is taught early and pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the entity slips away under layered silence, leaving Elias truly quiet; Miriam’s future work is now charged with visible cost. Causality is accumulative/textural—density of paradox drives the expulsion—held cleanly from first pedal press to last line. Cost is legible in the indigo mark fading and the monastery’s groan.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the shell-on-glass chord reweights silence into song. Closure is a Charged Poise—the mirrored horizon’s shimmer crystallizes cost without curing exhaustion. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. The only friction: the “mapping childhood memories” beat is summarized, not shown, blurring the causal bridge to the final note.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she had become its architect” reweights the premise with undeniable ontological cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early—folded timelines, procedural corridors—pays off in final image of rain-waiting traveler. Orientation anchored by viaduct/moss/tablet within 120 words; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: tablet cracks, runes spell “You are the labyrinth,” collapsing options. Cost visible in crimson glow-to-ordinary stone transition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the filament of hush reweights silence into song, cost is legible in the carved groove and carried drum. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each image thickens the mirrored hush until the cadence shift at the final beat—so the lens holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. The only drag is the late rule reveal that backward vinyl can “carve” silence; the payoff is beautiful but not primed, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pigeon’s flight crystallizes stakes and reweights Elias’s solitude with irrevocable exposure. Causal chain holds—every beat from roof to courtyard is laterally linked—but the “storm’s eye” key arrives via anonymous note, a soft external hinge rather than earned deduction. Lens is Accumulative: pressure mounts through repeated sensory patterning (storm data, sirens, dew), final image reframes the calm within the storm. Cost is legible in the rain washing “dust of doubt” away—an external emblem of internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    The accumulative pattern (scent → memory → grief → release) is taught by the third sentence and tightens through each aromatic return; closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the opened vial reweights both her future work and the reader’s sense of extinction itself. The “ultraviolet truth” line supplies the conceptual cost (she can never again seal grief away). No因果 turns are required under the lyric-accumulative lens; the final image crystallizes stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: the decision to carry the rope onward crystallizes the impossible choice between past anchor and future openness, cost felt in the final line “every fray is a door.” Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of knots and grotto layers thicken meaning until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by word 60; no causal contradiction. Lacks a persistent external constraint that could have sharpened tactics, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images stack (silence, bowl, fire, violin) until a final Charged Poise reweights silence as “whisper of hope.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as resonant image (“bowl now brimming with echo”) but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt; the chronic hush is declared “weakened,” not dramatized as narrowed option. Because no constraint back-propagates, the ending is pretty but semantically hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final static hum reweights the entire ritual, proving empathy remains a commodity he can meter but never own. Causality holds—each drop is tested, spark acknowledged, client dosed—until the last beat where the dealer’s own skin still crackles, foreclosing the option to feel freely. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetition of amber, static, and half-truths thickens the air rather than twists plot. Cost is felt in the lingering charge that will not ground; no larger external price is required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: misrouted envelope → locket discovery → investigation → Caleb found → joint ceremony; the library/star setting anchors each pivot, and closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena pockets the returned locket, now a talisman of perpetual compassion cycles—cost felt in her admitted inability to predict returns.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor sings their names together, reweighting Kael’s identity with visible cost—“the beautiful pain of roots taking hold.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reed offering, silence, and shimmer adds density until the tag’s revelation reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early via sensory cues (“crater’s rim,” “marsh-grass at his doorstep”), so the waiver applies; no penalty. Causality stays coherent: because he keeps weaving and listening, therefore the villagers shift and the arbor opens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes the first echo, the city’s cadence re-set, and the new stellar infinity symbol charges the image with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each Gasp adds density until the pendant’s borrowed time is spent and the architecture collapses. Orientation is swift: rooftop canal, moss, folio, and the giant’s brow are anchored within 50 words. The only causal fuzz is “the place where echoes are born” arriving late as a pure directive; it does not break the chain that leads her to strike the crystal bell.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each droplet, tile crack, and glass-eye reflection thickens ambient grief until the mosaic doorway offers a Charged Poise. Causality is loose but coherent—pattern recognition substitutes for because/therefore linkage. Closure lands on-page: the half-open doorway reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (loss can be held, not solved). No orientation debt; cavern anchors arrive by line 3 and stay stable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the boy reads aloud, Mara tastes coal smoke, and the library’s “delicate restoration” reweights every cached breadcrumb with visible emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cached object layers density until the final hush crystallizes meaning. Orientation is secured by word 40 (“subbasement”), well under the 120-word cap. No causal break; even the power outage is texture, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of storm → damage → forced repair → release → regrowth, each beat adding density until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the soaked narrator under the self-bent trellis crystallizes the new stance with undeniable cost—she is literally weather-exposed, no longer sheltering behind control. One transition (inside/outside) is legible; orientation anchors by line 5. No causality break; the linden leaf threads the sequence as tactile callback. Meets 9- gate except cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she gives the brooch, receives her own hopeful ghost, and elects to paint over it—an on-page renunciation that forecloses retreat into pure nostalgia. Causal chain holds: rain trails → brooch → scavenger → canvas → over-painting; each step tightens options under an Accumulative lens. Time/space anchored by line 3 (“tidal island”) and reinforced through tidal imagery. Cost is legible in the final image—she sleeps while the canvas reclaims her, implying surrender of the sleepless vigil she prized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of crystalline music and layered shadows builds density until the pearl’s surrender reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the cave’s new cadence and Lira’s tinted sight—felt cost is legible in “now tinted with the knowledge of what she hadn't seen.” Orientation anchors within 30 words; no causality breaks. One shard; transitions unnecessary. The pilgrim’s single-word beat works as pattern intensifier, not causal turn, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final pure silence reweights exile from wound to composition, cost legible in the navigator’s departure with “a transcript of his silences.” Causal lens holds—because she blows the staggered intervals, therefore the silences map harbors and the navigator weeps. Pattern of staggered intervals is taught by word 200 and pays off in the seventh sounding. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal linkage holds: the glowing cracks appear only after the antique punch ignites, each alley turn is a therefore of obeying those glyphs, and the door dissolves because she validates it with the punch she was mysteriously issued. Midpoint escalation is a single but decisive tightening—every step deeper into the mist forecloses retreat; the atlas is literally left behind. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fortress stabilizes around her, options narrowing to “learn to speak or remain architect of silence,” with the conceptual cost of owning every calcified confession already visible in the limestone pillar of her brother. One hairline slip: “she would map this place, too” projects future action rather than dwelling in the crystallized now, but the prior image of her touching her own unspoken truth keeps the reconfiguration felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the tower is re-inscribed as a public sanctuary, a visible cost paid in Lira’s relinquishment of private scientific distance. Causality holds—each mural fragment follows from tile-translated whale-star patterns she chooses to paint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of painted memories and whale-song echoes reweights the stakes until silence itself becomes communal. Minor slack: the fisherman’s first entrance is slightly teleported; we never see him approach or decide to climb, so the final image’s social cost is faintly under-announced.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each refractive shard thickens the pattern of endings rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and re-anchor at each shard break; disorientation serves closure payoff. The decisive change lands on-page—“exquisite release of uncertainty”—with conceptual cost legible in the final line. No meaningful accumulation caps triggered; closure is clean under inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sam hands over the photocopied ledger, foreclosing the exposé path while re-weighting the con’s moral algebra. Causal linkage holds: each beat (map → breach → ink pot reveal) tightens options under the 2:47 AM clock. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the $47 k price and the director’s narrowed eyes—shapes the final transaction. One minor scaffold: “waiting actively” is named repeatedly before its mechanics are shown, a faint loop that keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each dawn session adds density until the notepad swells into a codex, and closure lands as Charged Poise—the town’s silence re-weighted by the mosaic of invented histories gilded on the bonsai leaves. Orientation is complete by line 7; later spatial shifts stay coherent. The final image (“gold leaf caught the morning light…”) makes conceptual cost undeniable: the town’s real past is now overlaid with her fabulated palimpsest. Tightening is present but singular; no second turn escalates cost beyond the accumulating texture itself.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box, now heavy enough to “register on some cosmic scale,” reweights existence itself while the survivor stands “real, filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fragment layers density until meaning emerges in the negative space. Orientation is taught by line 5 (“Port authorities call the place the Grid”), waiving any penalty. Persistent constraint is legible: administrative erasure remains irreversible; the box’s weight anchors him to an outlaw life. One hairline slip: “translation” is named rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the riddle flips from “why silence?” to “the reader keeps becoming.” Cost is legible—the cracked shell and his self-sentence to ghosthood. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of hums, cracks, and spiral imagery tightens until the final chord reweights meaning. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 2). Minor bump: “ephemeral compass” is named before its behavior is taught, a tiny causality shimmer that keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal linkage holds: each mural is a because/therefore response to privatization pressure; closure lands as Earned Stasis—she pockets the stone, foreclosing open surrender. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only mild causality wobble is the off-stage “corporation’s deadline” that never materializes as an on-page threat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: grain falls → flare → photograph → bloom dies; the before/after is legible and irreversible. Closure carries visible cost—the violet flare becomes a death warrant—earning Charged Poise. The lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/when) arrive late but serve the hush effect, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the repaired drone’s true-north chirp reweights the whole depot into a compass the blind artisan can read. Causal chain intact—crack → refraction diagnosis → platinum patch → harmonic test → silver coins—each step tightening under the clock of the *Prospect*’s horn. Cost is visible in her exhausted fingertips still on cool metal; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first shattered feather to last.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael becomes the source, rivers unspring, maps are obsolete—cost is the obliteration of the observer-self. Causality is lyric-associative rather than strict, but the pattern (condensation → feather → crack → dissolution) is taught early and holds. The single causal gap: how “reading” frost translates to physical dissolution is asserted, not bridged, keeping the piece just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each footfall adds density until the cobblestone pattern “exhales” and the town re-tunes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the archway’s wild hush now holds possibility rather than doom, and the cost is the centuries Kael has already paid. Orientation is swift: archway, ghost town, immortal tuner all land by line 5. No causal reversal is required; the gradual cadence shift from death-frequency to life-frequency satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the quantum core stabilizes only because Lira becomes the silence, her flatline the price that reweights the premise. Causal chain holds: vial → corridor realignment → core capture; the transmitter’s data burst is the irreversible Decisive Change. Lens is pure Causal; every beat tightens options until breath is forfeited. Cost is legible in the cracked helmet line—no hand-waving.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the lattice stays behind, the door seals, and “chasing hush” becomes an eternal, conceptual price—an Earned Stasis that forecloses any return. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights the whole myth. One minor slack: the “before they find the bodies” ticking clock is declared but never visibly tightens tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused bead glows, orchard saved, ghost gone. Causality is poetic rather than sequential—why Elara is the lifetime debtor is never motivated—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural. Cost is conceptual (“love as poison and cure”) but not felt on-page by Elara; the debt repayment is external to her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the repeating sleep-tracings and silver stitches thicken until the tapestry mirrors stone, producing a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the alcove orchids glow—cost is conceptual (village hope re-priced). Orientation anchor (wharf, dusk-after-empty-tide) arrives within 60 words; transitions are single night-to-dawn cycles, legible. Closure is on-page: “the tapestry now a map that others could follow” crystallizes new options with undeniable social cost—broken nets stay broken, but meaning has shifted.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the sundial’s gradual reassembly tightens the “interrupted journeys” stake through density and cadence shift; the final image of whole stone casting a new shadow is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with felt cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words; no orientation penalty. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, permissible under this lens. Closure lands on-page (“the sun moved with deliberate slowness”), so 9+ gate is eligible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally paid in body or option; hence held just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the letter departs, Kael is left lighter yet exposed—an earned stasis with felt cost. Causality is causal: because Kael encodes, the letter can leave; because it leaves, Kael’s anonymity thins. Time and space remain anchored from the first paragraph; no orientation debt. The chalk-grid mechanics are taught early and paid off in the final photograph beat, satisfying pattern coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: each stitch-layer thickens tension until the fabric itself glows, delivering a Charged Poise—Mira steps into darkness carrying the hidden star, options re-ordered, risk now inevitable. The script message (“The coup will rise with the harvest moon”) is the single causal pivot that re-weights all prior texture; cost is legible in her snapped breath and the corridor swallowing her. One silent transition (observatory → hall) is taught by echoed footfalls; orientation anchored by word 40. No plot amnesia, no soft reset—static threat remains. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: silence itself is now a weapon she must wield.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal return/reprise (letters, shard, moonlight) tightens until the apology is literally released into current. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—letters become flotsam, silence becomes song—felt cost is the irrevocable privacy now surrendered to the swamp. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3; deliberate lyric disorientation is waived because spatial labyrinth pays off at closure. No causality breaks; every image reweights stakes under the moonlit rule.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decrypted “I kept your number too” reweights every prior absence with indelible social cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern of shard-transitions (hospital → atrium → bedroom) is taught by 25 % and coherent; condensation droplets as transition cue anchor time/space. Cost is visible in the punctured lung tethered to the unknotted guilt. No causality break; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s certainty dissolves into “a thousand questions” with visible conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each echo layers pigment and meaning—yet the visitor’s off-stage voice slightly softens the decisive on-page turn, holding the score just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because thoughts are taxed, therefore Aris caches meaning in seeds; because auditors arrive, therefore the greenhouse’s living chaos thwarts them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—gourd vines will rattle the city’s map of escape routes, a conceptual cost already seeded. Setup-to-payoff is tight: ladybug → bee → seed → rattle. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the seabed blossoms into a living treaty charged with “reef-shadow joy,” a visible social cost that reweights centuries of war. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly verse layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. However, the Orientation Test dings −0.3: “gargantuan shell that rose from the shoals like a fossilized moon” offers no anchor to depth, era, or scale until after line 120; the disorientation never pays off at closure, merely persists as decorative fog. Causality is lyric, not sequential, so the tightening is legitimate, but the price (her perpetual insomnia) is asserted, not dramatized in the final cadence, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sunrise image crystallizes her perpetual, lonely ritual while the cracked tube’s whistle carries undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—each lit orchid adds density and the regret cadence tightens. The early orientation of “opal library above clouds” anchors place and scale by line 3, satisfying Orientation Test. Slight deduction for one abstract beat (“museum of extinct feelings” repeated without new constraint) preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because Elara proves the ink binding, therefore she writes, therefore Kess answers, therefore they meet. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“subterranean extinct language archive”). Closure is Earned Stasis: the empty well beside two new ones visually reweights trust as a living grammar outside the archive, with conceptual cost (archive sealed, paths diverge). No soft resets; every beat advances knowledge or option narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: water sings over stone while the mountain’s exhalation reweights meaning; cost is felt in the council’s earlier tremor of doubt and Alia’s slyly heartfelt vow, all under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote pattern teaches early, tightens through meteorite warmth and ledger closure; final “new pattern bloomed” is Conceptual Repricing that reweights trust from paper to sky. Cost is legible—he abandons the ledger, his only relic of control—so Earned Stasis satisfies closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—wood-grain map ↔ weather-code ↔ counted steps—and layers density until the final prism image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the threshold dissolves behind the narrator, crystallizing the idea that “distances were not just steps but moments of reverence.” The cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator now carries an unending duty of measured reverence, foreclosing casual movement. One minor loop artifact (“the story ends in a breath…”) does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she stays, submersible leaves empty, oxygen debt becomes permanent—cost is visible. Causal chain holds: feather maps → plaza discovery → breath-sync → renunciation. One minor scaffold: “she hoped to find proof…” is told twice in adjacent sentences; trimming would tighten. Orientation is taught by word 70, well under the 120-word ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is fairy-tale solid: shard-flicker → seed-sprout → shard-completion → tidal return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sea doesn’t erase, it recollects, and that reweights every prior “loss.” Cost is legible in the final image—Lira walks away “empty of seeds,” her satchel a visible forfeiture. The lens stays accumulative/lyric throughout; no orientation debt; one smooth descent transition.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: bishop diagonal → each encounter reboots with visible ripple, tightening until the token is surrendered. Closure is a Charged Poise: the warm bishop in his palm reweights the entire algorithm—wildness now owns the engineer. Cost is legible in the final line: “wilderness had been tamed by calculation” now applies to Ezra himself. Orientation, lens, and scope all meet Track A defaults without waiver need.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: moon-dust → pigment → skin-map forms a legible chain that lands in a Charged-Poise closure. Orientation is quick; causality wobbles once—“spontaneous anchor” is vivid but never explained why the garden chooses her, a hairline break that keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure is present: a Conceptual Repricing re-weights the mundane as prism, “before everything shifts” acting as the cost marker. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern beats (glass, light, water, rings) accrete until meaning crystallizes; this lens is stable. Orientation is immediate and spatial anchors hold. Causality, however, is weak: the pond ritual is elective, not forced, so the beat feels like illustration rather than irreversible turn. Cost is announced rather than dramatized—no opportunity relinquished, no risk embraced on page—keeping the re-configuration cerebral, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the open, moon-filled box re-weights the rule-set—grief is not a burden to set down but a load to shoulder with purpose. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through recurring celestial imagery and the slow accretion of ash, stones, scars until meaning tilts. Every beat is causal in the textural mode: each return of light on cracked glaze intensifies the emotional tariff. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—porcelain “empty but full”—and the shift from carrying the box to carrying the memory is felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tight causal lattice: each balloon flight → gauge flicker → shell pattern → equation refinement. The final spiral mandala is a decisive change that fuses altitude number and frequency, paying off the 3-yr setup with conceptual cost: she surrenders omnipotence and trusts worlds to self-lift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sonic fossil, diary blister, and cracked emulsion layer thickens the density until the chalkboard formula reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as Mira presses forehead to stone and the corridor exhales “Remember, but act.” The cost is felt in the wal of separation: she leaves the passage that once defined her. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the mirrors retain a “faint glimmer,” reweighting the world’s reflective logic with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stanza layers prismatic color onto setting and motif until the final bell crystallizes the pattern. Causality is deliberately elliptical, but the piece teaches its lullaby-as-code rule early and pays it off in the mirrors’ shimmer; no orientation debt. The missing beat is a tangible price paid by the painter (she fades, but nothing is foreclosed for her), keeping the score just below the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: failed past → ritual gamble → shared touch → treaty signed; the hum of the clipboard is the decisive change with conceptual cost (they must now share a fragile future). Orientation is clean by line 4; the lens is causal throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—options narrow to trust or rupture—price transferred from lone negotiator to entire circle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the cracking salt map deepens the stake until the egg-release becomes the decisive pattern-break that reweights preservation against destruction; closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. The manufactured drought’s upstream causality is asserted, not witnessed, a minor ellipsis that keeps the score just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each thread she untangles layers density until the sanctuary shatters into a symphony of disobedience. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—windows fly open, compliance breaks—legible because the harvest of echoes is now loose in the city; cost is felt in the instant watchman’s whistle becomes question rather than warning.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The reversed-puppet structure delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the stick-as-question reweights narrative morality itself, with undeniable social cost legible in the patrons’ silent dispersion. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each backward tale strips justification until silence condenses. Orientation is swift and payoff earned; only the absence of any price boomeranging onto Adrian keeps this from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the monarch’s departure carries the moth-wing memory into empty flyways, reweighting the premise that signals must outlast the signal-maker. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each temporary structure layers density until the final wind-harp vibration becomes the pattern-break that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught immediately (“clouds pooled at its entrance like shy visitors”) and pays off in the 47° shadow-map. Cost is unmistakable: Esme’s life-work will shred by morning, a price she names and embraces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope’s constellation of voices reweights her exile from punishment to vocation, cost paid in the tearful circle of names. Accumulative lens holds: punched card → braid pattern → aurora-fed glow → sonic resurrection, each layer adding density rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 50; no disorientation served at end, so no penalty. One scaffold loop—“She began…, she pulled…, she touched…”—dulls final cadence slightly but does not obscure the reconfiguration image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bunker, storm-clock, and seventeen-year backstory are anchored by line 4, well inside 120-word allowance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the Archive was a repository of patterns, but patterns were meant to be broken” reweights the world-rule before the bunker collapses. Causal chain intact: each vine-count, tea dose, fox-stamp use leads to the wall-climb. Cost felt in cracked concrete ribs, lost decades, surrendered shelter—no explain-everything dump; final image is the loam swallowing the stamp.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile’s disappearance reweights the premise—knowledge survives not by owning but by releasing. Causal chain holds: each night’s measurement tightens possibility space until the schematic sequence triggers the vanishing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (260 sum, palace proportions, star overlay) intensifies until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the vanished object and the banners of the next regime already replacing his sky.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pin breaks again in Elara’s hand, reweighting the rule that grace must be re-won each shift; cost is felt in Mira’s exhausted exhale. Causal chain holds: pin’s reappearance → memory transfer → resentment loosens → reality stabilizes. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off at closure; no penalty applied. One causal beat could be tighter: the pin’s shift from broken to whole is asserted, not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored image and frost particle accretes until the orchard’s glass-transfiguration lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—“he had become the place where it chose to anchor.” No orientation debt; transitions breathe rather than break. Closure reweights the entire premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ribbon around the mender’s wrist reweights vows as deciduous, with palpable cost in the cathedral’s renewed breath. Causal chain intact—neglect → breach → return → ribbon graft → daughter’s emergence—each beat a because/therefore step. Orientation given inside 60 words; no prop teleporting; lens (Causal) holds. Only the daughter’s appearance is lightly lucky, but it complicates rather than solves, satisfying coincidence guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard is a cemetery, the fruit is a tombstone, and Evers’s tending is now a funeral rite—cost is the irreversible loss of innocence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous image layers density until the sigil-bearing shell rewrites the rule-set. Orientation is taught early via crystalline paths and weak gravity; the bathroom shard is a single, legible transition. No causality break; the tree’s gift is earned by the carved shell.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s once-blank pages become a “completed song,” the mountain sings louder, and the library is re-opened with conceptual cost—knowledge now carries audible risk. Causal linkage holds: gaps → key → stairway → rescue → completed diary. Orientation is swift; “the mountain bookstore rose like a forgotten organ” anchors who/where inside 25 words. One minor slack: the time traveler’s departure adds no constraint or price, but the warden’s continued presence supplies the persistent brake needed for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship’s exhalation and thinning fog reconfigure Mira’s options without curing her; the cost is the eternal drift she embraces. Causality is lyric rather than tight—each beat accumulates texture—yet the pattern is taught early and held to the final image. Orientation is clear by line 6; no orientation penalty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: seal anomaly → folio → tower → hidden door → rope → re-braid → history healed. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) nailed by word 80; no drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the midnight chime adds a beat that reweights 300 years of scholarship—undeniable social cost. Persistent constraint: the vanished door and altered maintenance logs prove price survives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of acoustic imagery builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the final eye-of-silence image—where the cost is felt as perpetual vigilance. Orientation anchored by word 50; one soft “then” transition inside continuous scene; no causality breaks; bloom arrival reweights all prior crack-tracing labor.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s silent light reweights coincidence into pattern; cost is felt in the three approaching strangers whose arrival forecloses her solitude. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard, star path, and gust is a taught pattern that converges in the prism array.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush reweights identity from fragments to “spaces where experience dissolved,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of shadow-length notes, whispers, crystal images—and the cadence shift at the end is legible. Orientation is taught by word 50 (stormlit observatory above frozen fog), so no penalty. One minor loop: “preemptively nostalgic grief” is announced twice in near-paraphrase; otherwise causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the flames create a communal “chorus of gasps” that visibly loosens despair, and the final image of ember dust trailing behind Cinder gives theconceptual cost—that she must keep burning her own fuel. Causality is accumulative/textural: each sensory echo (chant, clink, mosaic) layers density until the fire re-weights the night’s meaning. The lens holds without ambiguity; the empty sky and blooming fortress are anchored by word 40. One soft loop—“She smiled. She smiled again”—is minor scaffold that does not touch the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide’s rise and the cicada’s warmth crystallize a stance of quiet release with legible, if gentle, cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple and star-silver layer deepens the stake—though the single tightening is subtle. Orientation is secure by line 3; no因果 breaks occur. One scaffold loop (“texture of time” repeated almost verbatim) slightly dulls the final image, keeping the score just below the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: silence flavors accrue in patterned refrains until the high-altitude “flavorless” break reweights the gilded hush. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late (~150 w) but the delay is purposeful, mirking claustrophobia; payoff at closure waives penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “prison could hold a garden” crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—daily sealing ritual—shapes tactics, but the inversion hour is external machinery, not because/therefore linkage; causality is soft, acceptable under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the diplomat’s quiet weep and acceptance of the vial reweights silence from threat to portable peace, cost shown in Kael’s relinquishment. Causal linkage holds: each harmonic adjustment causes his measurable calm. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the final hush reprises the opening echo, tightening cadence. One hairline slip: “fluidly logical” appears twice as self-conscious phrase rather than action proof.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the ruby rewrites the orchard, the murals, and the throne’s status. Causality is elliptical (Accumulative/Textural lens) yet coherent—each peeled mural tightens the mental map and the sunrise clock supplies cost. Orientation is secured by ~120 words (acid rain, nano-tube, lunar citadel). One minor causality gap: the stairway “requires downward passage” rule is told, not dramatized, but the final image retrofits it as test, not loophole.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring on the altar reweights the premise—thresholds can be reforged, but only at the cost of perpetual guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each exhaled shadow adds density until the sanctuary itself breathes, a resonant reconfiguration paid for by her eternal vigil. Causality is sound; no orientation debt. The waning threshold is felt, not explained, keeping cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the crystalline crackle reweights the premise (pressure → diamonds) with visible cost (illicit bolt-turn, communal fund). Causal chain is pseudo-scientific—rule introduced ad-hoc—yet internally consistent; lens is Hybrid (causal bolt act + accumulative lyric reprise) and holds to final image. Orientation is swift; no prop teleporting. Escalation is one-step, not tightening spiral, so pressure plateaus before snap; still satisfies single-turn requirement at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “standing waves of time” re-weights the dynasty premise, making remembrance the new obligation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each crank rotation thickens sonic density until the erased heir’s name surfaces, foreclosing the assassin-option. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the doorway swallows Aldric and rewrites the greenhouse into a cosmos of puppets—cost is the irreversible loss of singular self. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (silver vines, petrified-fruit puppets, unsnapping) layers density until the final folding of light reweights reality. Orientation is anchored early (glass cathedral, perpetual darkness by line 3). One soft spot: the “abandoned marionette theater program” is discovered without prior causal seed, a minor teleporting prop, but it is immediately woven into pattern logic and does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns accumulate meaning until the final letter reweights the stake for Marianne and the reader. Causality is present yet soft—each archival act tightens the emotional net rather than forcing external turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the daughter’s letter crystallizes a generational shift from “nothing” to “someone,” with the conceptual cost that Marcus never lived to feel it. No orientation debt; space-time anchors settle by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: stolen code → ash → puddle map → lagoon → key triggers door → swallow crystal → scatter rest. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she is erased by the System but the data survives. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and tighten at every shard break. One transition (city→lagoon) is legible; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dew-note adds density until silence frays the prism code; the final image—the grotto an “empty radiant shell”—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the prophecy erased, the musician gone). Causality is poetic but legible: low note → hush swallows colored code → prophecy dissolves. Orientation is immediate; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared in sentence one (“perpetual twilight”) and held: each seed, leaf, and dust grain thickens pattern until the final “chorus of forgotten voices” reweights the world. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lira stands amid beacons, rain of silver leaves reconfiguring folklore itself—cost is the irreversible substitution of memory for ash. No orientation debt; geography stays legible across the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the instant she leaves the greenhouse doors “wide to whatever wind might come,” the prior obsession with perfect mending is foreclosed with visible social/artistic cost. Causal chain holds: 12 clocks → compass rose → greenhouse drain → waterfall gears → compass-as-key → new rhythm. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5; no penalty. The “because/therefore” linkage tightens once—jamming the compass redirects the waterfall and re-syncs city clocks. Cost is legible in the final image: she accepts perpetual imperfection as living condition.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the coin’s dissolution reweights “Alder” from lost body to distributed light, with undeniable social/ethical cost—she stops searching. Causal linkage holds: because the coin revealed mass = name, therefore she renounces retrieval. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early by rain-soaked bricks, furnace embers, gold-filled cracks, each returning in brighter register. Final image of foundry “shadow stretched long and golden, its cracks painted by dawn” is Charged Poise where cost is felt even though no physical price is exacted.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the laugh reweights the entire premise—healing is integration, not restoration—and the spent tooth clicking against the vial makes the cost audible. Causal lens holds: because Kael keeps scraping the bass string, the fractured laughter returns and reconfigures their self-definition. No orientation or telegraphing issues; gorge and stakes are anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each UV pulse and strap touch thickens the pattern until the final reweighting—“mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived”—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by word 30; disorientation serves the payoff. No causal gaps; every return of violet fire or proprioceptive surge adds density rather than outline sequences. Closure beat carries undeniable price: she forecloses absolution and embraces open-ended survival math.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the narrator accepts keeper-guardianship, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (“the light never dies; it only waits”). Causal chain is thin—fragment → painting → journal → self-appointment—but each link is on-page and irreversible. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pocketed barrel and the cracks re-weight Marlon’s life-long quest, making “bearing witness” the new, weightless burden. Causality is sound: dust pattern → barrel → ghosts speak → ceiling cracks → decision to leave most behind. The single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no disorientation penalty. One subtle causality gap: why the ghosts solidify only on touch is implied, not dramatized, but does not rupture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the shattering of two mirroring libraries compresses everything into a crystalline instant that rewrites the world-rule of “up” and “down,” and the single printed word “Here” lands the cost of eternity captured yet unkeepable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure mounts by density of frost, glass fruit, and whisper rather than strict causal chains—and the final image reconfigures meaning without contradiction. Orientation is taught immediately (“the glass orchard library floated…”) and anchors are refreshed each paragraph; no orientation debt. The rupture traceable to Elara’s decision to free the whisper ensures the change is protagonist-driven, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covered mirror now shows a poem, not a lie, and the conceptual cost—truth can only live under cloth—reweights every prior sepia filter. Because/therefore causality holds: shard → storm inscription → Voss’s nod → Kael’s ongoing chronicle; no beat resets or convenient amnesia. Persistent constraint (the cloth, the shard, the covered mirror) shapes tactics from midpoint through last line.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each lie or truth immediately manifests as physical corrosion or healing, tightening options until the final tether act releases dawn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the music box keeps playing, the repairman’s skin is “smooth as polished brass,” and the woman is revealed as the city’s song—an undeniable conceptual cost that re-weights every prior gear-polish. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 120 words beneath the clock tower; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image: his restored body and the endless truthful tune.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning compass + scent-circle reconfigure her life’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she now guards the ineffable. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; density of scent-memory images escalates until measurement dissolves. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint established: “she would become its keeper” forecloses future entry. Cost is legible in the final image—“empty pocket… resonant hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layering (turbine-hum, salt-black stone, lantern projection) tightens the same stake—find the pattern that includes her—until the final carved token reconfigures her identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archway glows, the lineage becomes legible, and the cost is the irrevocable insertion of her token into the stone niche. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 40. Causality is thematic-cumulative rather than plot-reversal, appropriate to lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of postcard→cathedral glass→mural layers teaches the “hidden image” rule by 25 % and holds to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are stable; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: Sable’s heart “bloomed like the night flowers,” a crystallized stance that reconfigures her prior search. Closure unit qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration; no causality breaks, though the cathedral apparition edges on coincidence it complicates rather than resolves, permissible under Situational allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: joint disclosure crystallizes new equilibrium with social cost (grandfather’s reputation bargained). Causal lattice holds—diary cipher → debris key → grandfather’s vault photo—each because/therefore tightens options. Lens is causal throughout. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt; cost unmistakable in final image of dunes “silent and shifting.” Minor slack: Under-Minister motivation shift summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared and held: each lantern-lit image thickens meaning until the sealed bottle’s final shimmer reweights memory itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—lanterns glow, bottle intact, cost felt in the chorus that fades to silence. Causality is lyric but coherent: memory-training → sand blueprints → settlers arrive. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first clause.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s heartbeat is now archived in wax, a velvet disquiet sealed beneath the medlar, cost legible in the silver lock and the leaf-vein echo. Causal chain holds—memory cue → accidental recording → immersion → vault—though the “because” that makes the prophecy dangerous is implied rather than tested on-page; stakes stay abstract. Orientation is clean within 120 words: rooftop orchard after foghorn, oath scribe alone with phonograph. One shard, single POV, default scope met; no structural violations. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sound-silence-wax ripples reweights meaning; final image crystallizes the archive as living, not static.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the reopened vortex converts ice into living oak and reconfigures the stakes from survival to guardianship. Causality is lyric rather than strictly because/therefore, but the entropy-reversal ritual is foreshadowed and paid off. Orientation is swift—within 50 words we have place, weather, and bloodline stakes—so no penalty applies. The vortex inheritance stays abstract, yet the final image of sprouting roots makes the cost visible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the switch untouched, the bell silent, the storm bending away—cost is the credibility risk she now owns. Causal chain holds: glue → rope unusable → instruments stall → she refrains → silence becomes the warning. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a CR: the overlooked era is re-priced as “cocoon for transformation,” glass set in window casting warm glow—felt cost is the years of tending silence. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of hush → moss → sanctuary tightens meaning without causal reversals. One scaffold trace—“the station’s silence was a deliberate choice” (concept told late)—nicks clarity, but image reweights premise with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each image adds density to the dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—until the stained-glass box crystallizes the covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise: the box glowing on the altar reweights all prior dust-and-silence imagery with undeniable conceptual cost. A single causal micro-turn—realizing the hives are hollow—legibly narrows her option to restoration. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (collapsed hive, stone altar) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern teaches early that numbers are liquefying; each capsule description adds density until the ledger letters themselves run. Closure is Charged Poise: the pair “began to sort…by the weight of their untold stories,” reconfiguring Elara’s toolkit with conceptual cost (she abandons the listing gambit she arrived with). Causality intact: garage-sale messages → lure → figure appears, no teleporting. Orientation anchored by word 80; no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of gathering fragments → writing → releasing. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the feather left on driftwood reweights “incomplete” as sufficient. Cost is present but soft—an offering whose price we never feel in his body or options. Transitions are smooth, yet the middle third circles in lyric summary rather than tightening the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s hum re-weights death from absence to embassy, cost legible in the vanished body and singing wires. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each copper coil adds density until the final exhale reconfigures meaning. The diary’s marginalia pattern is taught by 25 % and pays off in the last line’s altered handwriting. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first 120 words and closure image returns to those anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer tightens the same question (“why return?”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the molecular map rewrites exile into homecoming for her. Orientation is secure by line 4; the amber-pulse linkage is slightly convenient but pattern-taught. Cost is felt but not persistent—no tool breaks, no social loss on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the battlefield’s transformation into garden reweights the premise—memory and death now share breath with bloom. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of dead languages, seed dust, and bird-calls layer until the final image crystallizes option and cost. Causality holds: because he sings, the pods crack; because he listens, he finds water; because he persists, the grey scar softens. Cost is visible in the cracked pods, the raw voice, and the nightly return that forecloses rest.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the leaf, cylinder, and vault form a density spiral that reweights “distance” from mileage to silence. Closure is Charged Poise—Wick curled among messages, cost felt in the hush he now breaks nightly. Orientation clean by 120 words; causality intact (leaf → hatch is set up by vein-pattern match). One causal gap: how Kess’s phonograph still turns with a cracked horn on one scavenged battery—minor but keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the hatch opens, the station silhouette is left behind, and the compass-rose halo re-weights “true north” as internal resolve—conceptual cost is unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through silence-sketch-silence iterations, then snaps to departure. Orientation is anchored by word ~80; no causal or prop jumps. A hairline slip: “stretched time” is asserted more than demonstrated, but it never breaks the logic of the exit window.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    Causal chain is present yet slack: every obstacle (mirrors, gears, chess swap) is immediately soluble by inherited instructions. The closure beat—“pocket sundial lid over the crack”—is a tidy fit, but the world-rule that brass etchings can mend crystal hearts is taught only at the instant it solves the problem. Orientation is clear by word 50, satisfying the test. Lens is Causal; closure is a Decisive Change, but because the heart’s failure never jeopardizes Kaelen’s person or creed, the cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reverse walk repatterns the gallery from prison to archive, cost legible in Kael’s solitude. Causal chain holds: because he walks the word, therefore the panel opens, therefore the past is restorable, therefore he stays. Orientation is anchored by the 60-word mark; the “interregnum” cities cape and vacant throne cue who/where/when. One hairline slip: the nomadic penumbra’s leader is quoted without prior on-page seed, but the line is paid off by Kael’s final vow.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s dissolution reweights the bookstore itself into “the shape of home,” with the silvered feather as visible, portable cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each corridor’s breath and glyph-glow adds density until the final pulse re-maps the labyrinth. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (shifting corridors) and pays off when the shelves “align into a pattern”; no anchors remain unclear. One meaningful tightening—the stone’s activation—reconfigures meaning without a causal reversal, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Holding the causal lens, the tapestry’s thread-to-move logic keeps because/therefore linkage tight; each pluck narrows options toward the silver key. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 4 and the temporal stasis rule is taught early; orientation test waived because the freeze is functional at closure. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the key turns, time restarts, and the tutor’s resumed teaching carries visible emotional cost (“his heart a quiet storm”). One minor causality bump: the verse “When the king’s sacrifice is accepted” appears late yet is treated as prior knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered pigment turns the ritual’s “single truth” into spectrum, visible cost paid on-page (“Each tower cast a different shadow now…”). Causal chain holds: poems refract grief → travelers question → Elders stop; the final image reweights the community’s rule-set. Pattern taught early (refracting light) so the glass burst feels inevitable, not deus ex.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the statue warms, gold traces sing, and the workshop steadies—undeniable conceptual repricing. Causal chain is tight: each crater-matching act mechanically advances both repair and atmospheric doom. Lens (Causal) holds; every “click” narrows breath and option. The crumbling scarab at the end is the visible, irreversible price.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mirror crack sets a pattern of memory-fracture, the wrong turn deepens texture, and the final act of painting reweights the dominant stake with visible cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias relinquishes the shell and forecloses return to the quay obsession. Cost is legible in the final “quiet thank you” and the still water that keeps the secret. The wrong-turn mechanics are lightly coincidental but allowed under this lens; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cobalt lens filters Elara’s intent into a whisper Marcus finally hears, re-weighting their entire dynamic with undeniable cost—“teach me how to listen” spoken in a voice cracked from disuse. Causal linkage is tight: cork → lens → vibration → Marcus’s chest-level recognition, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dawn, and profession are anchored within 50 words. The lighthouse’s dual function (guide ships + filter hope) is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: each midnight call layers density until the seventh “Now” collapses possibility into a single resonator pulse. Closure is a Charged Poise—bridge open, sister’s voice audible, cost crystallized in the bronze dimming. Orientation clean before 120 words; causal chain (moon → weight → circuit → bridge) never breaks. No off-stage teleportation; every new frequency is soldered on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: find eye → truth-curse → bury → retrieve → ritual binding → communal disclosure, each step narrowing options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked eye’s map reweights the premise—truth must be metered, not silenced—cost is the permanent vigilance implied by “study the antique glass eye.” One causality bobble: the textbook cure (hair of the never-lying) is introduced and abandoned in the same breath, never testing the protagonist, so the final sap-soaked linen feels lightly earned rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory pulse tightens the keeper’s isolation until the beam becomes witness. Closure lands as Charged Poise—beam + jar + sketch re-weight memory’s value with undeniable conceptual cost (“Memory is the true keeper of light”). No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive within 60 words. TheCost proof is the final sketch sentence, where ownership of memory is visibly transferred to the lighthouse itself.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the doorway reweights every paper life he ever chose. Causal linkage holds: because the creek rises, therefore the door opens, therefore he walks—cost is the literal dissolution of his past identity. The mid-story reflective block is anchored to the glimmering matrix and paid for by the final forfeiture; lens (Hybrid→Causal at end) stays coherent. Minor warp: the “younger self” voice is undeclared until it speaks, a late rule tweak, but it does not break the logic already taught by the matrix beam.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: dream → climb → vision → surrender. The grotto’s memory-dump is elegantly foreshadowed by “bleeding starlight,” so the revelation feels inevitable, not ex machina. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she had become the dream” reweights every prior image with conceptual cost—immortality as erasure. The slight dock is for an overture of court advisors that never materializes into on-page opposition, leaving the early stake a shade abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the shell-curl becomes a “lens” that reweights the past; the vial seal supplies visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pigment and chant thickens the air until presence materializes. Orientation is swift (“at the ember nexus at twilight” by line 1). The single causality gap—why indigo is the necessary reagent—doesn’t rupture the lyric pattern, but it keeps the beat just shy of decisive. Transitions are smooth; no prop or motive vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scroll’s glowing sentence reweights the premise—chronicler dies, dreaming continues—under Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the sap bleed and the narrator’s descent “as a narrative.” One shard, no orientation debt; pattern of lyric recursion taught by line 2 and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the screw, fog, and clock drops layer into a final Charged Poise where Elena threads the screw onto a chain—an unmistakable conceptual re-pricing of her grief. Orientation is swift; causality is interior but legible; cost is felt in the relinquishment of smell-centric identity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shimmering ink-fractures tighten the stake iteratively until the rune glows, a visible repricing of grief. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—crystalline story-beacon reweights her past and future in one image; tear mingling with ink is the undeniable cost. Micro-turn (ink refuses line, then accepts tear) is the single required tightening. Could edge 9.0 if final rock-drift carried a persistent constraint beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared minor chord and handshake crystallize a new, precarious truce under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the orchard’s literal fall and the perfume’s irreversible dispersal. Causality holds: perfume → memory → apology → handshake, each step because/therefore. The axe-image reweights all prior silence, making the stake legible without explanatory tell.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the library dissolves into her bloodstream, making the cost of unity literally visceral. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; each recursive image (spiral, dust, hush) thickens until the final cadence shift reweights all prior texture. Orientation anchors—temple library, timeless moment—arrive within 60 words, well before the 120-word threshold. No causal break touches the ending; surrender is the earned constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene, causal lens: each backward count is a because/therefore step that narrows options toward the final conceptual flip. Orientation is clean—cliff station, fjord, dusk, hydraulic clock—all within first 60 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that clocks measure remaining silence, paid for by the key’s glow and the dropped water level—cost is visible and felt. The only minor slack is a slight loop of “razor edges” that could have been pruned once.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final image of “absence could bear fruit” reweights every prior breach as love’s nutrient. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of nightly returns, photo placements, luminescent pulses—culminating in a single cadence shift at 7:15 AM when Kael rewrites the alarm code. No causal gaps; even the laminated photograph is pre-seeded by the wife-cultivator backstory. Cost is legible in the final beat: Kael will now hear every alarm as a possible grief-message, a permanent perceptual mutation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: lantern scrawls → subway hunt → sealed alcove → hidden deck, each step narrowing options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern becomes a pedagogical beacon whose cost is the irreversibility of her father’s death and her vow to repurpose risk. The Orientation Test is waived: late disorientation (false panel, corridor) is taught early by the lantern-map and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the disc shatters, the tunnel falls silent, Mira walks out with cut palms—visible cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly repetitions thicken until the glass note pierces and reweights the stake. Causality holds, but the trigger for the final snap is under-dramatized; the story tells us “she decided” rather than showing a last-straw beat inside the loop. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (walnut-ink, jasmine, salt air) densifies until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—her journal becomes a “map” for others—conceptual cost legible. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who/where delayed) is taught early and pays off in the twilight jetty image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she uncaps the ink vial, foreclosing retreat. No causal break, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon fragment, once memento, becomes communal cornerstone, reweighting the station’s social contract. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each whispered memory tightens the silver glow until shared hope crystallizes; Mira’s exit is the visible price. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ivy-veined platforms”), no debt. The final image (“polite anarchy of shared stories”) makes conceptual cost undeniable: isolation is foreclosed, reciprocity is the new rule.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ring’s final stillness reconfigures the premise that maps are external; the cost is the irreversible internalization of her mother’s silence. Causality holds: each ultrasonic note she traces (beat 1) → ring torque westward (beat 2) → silence node (beat 3) → crystallized blaze. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“vibrating bark”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative texture intensifies until the hinge-night image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each pen-stroke narrows future options and visibly depletes the reservoir, tightening until the dry nib forces renunciation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the anomaly’s gentler arcs + Kael’s whispered “thank you” reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—he must now live the remaining mistakes. Orientation taught early via sensorial anchoring and spatial cues; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint (empty pen) shapes final tactics. Cost is legible in the moment he sets the pen down and accepts unedited grief.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the empty shutter becomes metronome, silence becomes score, and “forgotten” flips from curse to vocation. Causality is causal-linear: because she maps silence → therefore he reclaims agency; because he reclaims agency → therefore he chooses endless solitude as art. The lens is stable Causal; every beat tightens options until the final spiral sign forecloses reunion with the living. Cost is stamped on-page: “Your music is not for the living to hear” — a life-sentence of ghost-performance — satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the vault of untouched histories is accessed only because Kael’s mural trail (Fibonacci angle at dawn) reweights their prior fires from erasure to revelation—an on-page Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each mural beat is because/therefore linked to the next cipher layer. Orientation is anchored early (library ruin, volcanic foothills, 3 yrs off-grid). The only slip is the late, un-foreshadowed “bioluminescent fungi” that briefly softens the physical logic of pigment sourcing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lovers become the garden’s syncopated heartbeat, a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. The lens is accumulative/textural—pattern of drumming builds density until identity liquefies—and holds without contradiction. Causality is lyric rather than plot-linear, acceptable under Track B mosaic; the “hush of the universe inhaling” recurs as taught pattern. Cost is legible in the disappearing body and the facility’s misreading of it as “malfunction.”

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: storm → cranes freeze → bet accepted → acoustic plan executed → north-gate forced → manual alarm. Closure is a Charged Poise: "silence builds better bridges than thunder" reweights every prior map-fold; cost is the eternal return of storms and challengers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 ("Port Kessler"); no penalty. One scaffold loop—"He’d proven that whispers travel farther than shouts" is a near-paraphrase of smuggler’s premise; minor, does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a quiet, conceptual cost felt at "the faint scent of change"; lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of window-puzzles deepens civic mood; summary-to-scene ratio is high, muting some causal edges, but the final reweighting still reads legible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the island sinks while Mira dances atop the crest, foreclosing return and repricing her identity without a sword raised. Causal lens holds: whale-call → scrimshaw glow → rope released → guardian dissolved → island retreat, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop or knowledge teleport. Cost crystallized in the final image—“bound for a horizon without chains”—felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the performer accepts the remade hush as survival canvas, cost felt in “fragile, fleeting lightness.” Accumulative lens holds—each whittling/narration beat thickens texture until the dawn placement crystallizes the stance—though the dog beat is a soft tangent that slightly dilutes the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (lantern-moth hush, quartz hum, cloud-shadow) thickens until the lake’s sigh reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by image rather than exposition—who/when emerge by ~80 words—so waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final silhouette merge reconfigures the boundary she sought to dissolve, with felt cost in the fading light. No causal break, though the beat could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of mirrored spirals—ashes, plant spiral, grey canvas—builds toward the final rainbow flash that reweights “imperfection” as beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the two stand before their flawed creations, options re-cast, cost felt in the shared hush. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn: the trade offer itself; no second decisive change, fitting the 600-word default.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final bell-ring reweights the premise—connection needs flaw, not fidelity. The “golden shadows pulsing like a remembered heartbeat” crystallizes the cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: each spin of the lens and bell-tilt because/therefore reveals new overtones, culminating in the deliberate imperfection that redefines success. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words; no ambiguity or disorientation persists.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each origami dissolving tightens the pattern and reframes earlier “genuinely artificial” artifacts as memory seeds. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the last crane points “nowhere,” turning the coordinate motif into an open invitation rather than destination—felt cost is the surrender of certainty. One micro-transition (observatory → airlock deck) is legible via spatial echo. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the measuring tape stretched across the spread reweights “ruin-to-possibility” as a grid the architect can now read, costing him his prior worldview. Causal lattice holds: each card dealt is a because/therefore node—seven towers fall, therefore roots appear, therefore the architect asks to rebuild. The rain metronome and tape-coiled-between-them object keep tension material. Orientation is taught early (“rain assaulting the skylight” by word 6) and anchors hold.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical recurrence of twilight, bronze reflection, and “atoms of nostalgia” tighten the stake toward the final Charged Poise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Lyra’s realization that innocence is a continuum carries undeniable conceptual cost and is etched in the final saffron-veil image. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. Causality is soft: the pagoda’s appearance at twilight feels situational rather than earned by prior tactic, and the purification success is narrated rather than traced to specific irregular thought-drift. Still, the final image reweights the premise cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transformed shadow becomes guardian veil, cost felt in her emptied pocket and “luminous regret.” Causal chain—stone’s path traced across footage, then physically pressed—holds. Orientation is swift; library/cloud anchors arrive by line 4. One minor causality gap: why decades-old footage reacts to stone is asserted, not seeded, but the lyric logic carries the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the partner vanished, therefore she burns the brochures; because the tail is wounded, therefore she mixes salve and stays to fight for custody. One clear Decisive Change—she opens the door to the officer—carries the concrete risk of public shame and loss of license. Orientation is clean within 60 words; the only soft spot is a mid-paragraph summary of “three hours ago” that could have been dramatized, but the closure beat is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: dawn light, frost, coffee rings, pebble-glow layer into a resonant reconfiguration—scars become readable text. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the hourglass now measured the moments of her own healing” reweights all prior imagery with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; single-scene default met. The tunnel reveal is coincidence, but under situational/accumulative rules coincidence may complicate, not resolve, so allowed. Cost is felt (“displaced miracle settle into her bones”), though causality between sedation → telepathy → insight is off-stage and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira carries the theatre’s archived love as silver-nitrate skin map—cost is irreversible silence and bodily tenancy. Causal linkage holds: because she incubates the strip in amber bath, therefore the letters dissolve into transferable geometries; because she accepts the map, therefore the building’s soul migrates. Orientation anchors (Rialto, final week, projection booth) arrive within first 120 words; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of unused love reweights the stake until the map tattoos her—and holds without contradiction to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (sextant, star-tracings, aurora) deepens the stake of silence vs. song. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she rises with “quiet confidence” and the page now “alive,” a reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the frozen journey can’t be undone). Orientation is swift; causality is atmospheric, not beat-by-beat, acceptable under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the guard dissolves into the charm, midnight becomes a visitable garden, and the clock strikes thirteen—undeniable reweighting of rules with cost (voice cracked to blood). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyric shard adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and pays off, so no penalty. One tightening—planting the archive—suffices; causality of quantum beats is lyrically coherent rather than literal.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dawn’s new biome layers pattern until “she had become its architect.” Closure achieves Charged Poise—map/territory fusion with conceptual cost—because the final line crystallizes ongoing transmutation. Transitions among groves are legible via sleep-frame, satisfying mosaic Track B. No orientation debt; who/where taught early via “copper leaves chimed against brass bark.”

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the shoreline lullaby and star stamp accumulate until the cove reprise reweights “unused courage” as already owned. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lin rises with the dog, options reconfigured—but the ferry guides’ ticket punch is never paid for; cost is only atmospheric, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: she descends to report before failure repeats. Lens is Causal: because she once stayed silent ➔ piano collapsed ➔ she is now wired to act. The bolt’s weight in pocket and the new rust spot tighten the therefore chain to an undeniable fork. Cost is legible in the final image—tools handed over, her silence finally broken in signed words.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: glamour shatters, throne stands empty, library exhales—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: inscribed riddle → Vael’s finger trace → glamour fray → Sylvar’s will completes sundering. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via slow-time imagery and ink beats, paid off in collapsing stones and fading rune. Slight cap remains: cost is felt but not persistent—no constraint carries forward into next vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished lane reweights the premise that predictive models are coral-fragile. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of rising breaths, periodic ghosts—held to the final image. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. The cost is unmistakable in “some paths are gone, others waiting to be drawn,” but the tightening is single-thread; no secondary reversal or constraint shapes tactics, keeping it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the port-wide song reweights silence into weaponized sound, cost felt in her exposed solitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hum-beacon-song builds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no ambiguity. Because the stone circle’s resonance is introduced as pre-colonial constant rather than new rule, no late-rule break; persistent constraint (the hum) shapes every tactical move. Accumulation cap does not apply—only one minor loop (“bare feet” twice in 30 words) does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: kite discovery → night decoding → vent submersion → seed reveal rewrites communal destiny. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the amber’s long myth is folded in through present-tense stimuli that tilt Mara’s choices. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fossilized hope is literally dissolved and re-valued, with the scald on her arms paying the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by repetitive tactile beats (photo, bark, wind) that intensify rather than linearly cause. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) met by line 3; no disorientation. Closure is Charged Poise: final image of him descending while lighthouse “blinks” reweights earlier automation—his body becomes the human beam, cost legible in “heartbeat in his pocket.” Persistent constraint: he must return tomorrow to keep the light; no soft reset. All props (photo, eucalyptus, automated beam) track intact with causal state changes.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silk thread layers density until the pattern ruptures into the final re-weaving. Orientation is taught early—“salt and silverfish devour forgotten atlases”—and pays off when mortar weeps salt at climax. The decisive reconfiguration lands in the charged image of an eye-weeping box lid; the price is the permanent ache she elects to keep. Causality is internal—thread-touch → vision → re-stitch—but coherent under the lyric drive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink’s final vanish crystallizes Kael’s stance—he will keep spilling, keep chasing—while the cost (vanished drone, time’s opacity) is undeniable. The causal lens holds: because the drone disappears into the ink pattern, therefore Kael resolves to repeat the experiment. Orientation is anchored by word ~80 with “wind carved encampment” and “returning light.” No meaningful escalation beyond the single tightening, but that tightening forecloses the option of immediate retrieval and is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: discovery → decision → broadcast → systemic collapse, each because/therefore link clean. Closure is a sharp CR: the quiet is repriced from tomb to womb, cost felt in the rising screams and her singled-out danger. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props; persistent constraint (snow, servers, tubes) shapes tactics. One hairline slip: “within the blink that follows surprise” is used twice; the reprise doesn’t deepen, just repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each rose row, artifact, and storm gust thickens the same stake—quiet continuity. Closure is a charged poise: the disc and sandbag counterweight crystallize her chosen stasis. The stranger exit is micro-turn, not decisive change, so cost is conceptual, not visceral; still legible under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the withdrawn spike and settling echo reconfigure Avery’s stance with felt cost (“some catches become offerings”). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of transliteration, zigzag, silence—culminates in the final cadence shift. One transition, single scene, orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is unmistakable: the scanned memo flying out at 3 a.m. reconfigures both public trust and her private orbit, and the indent her father’s nib leaves in the desk is the visible price. The causal chain—phone call → catalogue of red-ink absences → proof-by-contradiction memo → transmission—never loosens. The drive lens (Causal) is held without waver; every beat is because/therefore. Earned Stasis is achieved: she can no longer remain a silent satellite.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—constellations unravel, firmware hushes, silence is felt cost—under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of moth-letter → amber → handwritten correction tightens meaning and cadence. Causality is internal-logical within its folded-time rule-set; no teleporting props. Orientation taught early (“laboratory existed only when time folded”) and pays off in the final fold-back. One shard, one POV, no mid-paragraph slippage; compression is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violet slash reweights silence from void to map, and the grotto’s chalk fossils make the cost legible. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk stroke thickens the hush until the tile’s dissolution crystallizes silence. The single-scene structure is coherent; spatial anchors (grotto floor, mandala center) remain stable. The seventh-turn rule is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the carved “Plaza of Embers” reconfigures the city’s memory and Arin’s own stance, the tessera’s click against his ribs a felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each retrocognitive pulse tightens the obligation to remember. Orientation anchors within 120 words (“ancient plaza… shattered sky”). The lens holds, but the price is more symbolic than tactical—no object state or future path is visibly foreclosed—so it stays shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final echo fuses ghost and actress across the splintered timeline, re-configuring both their futures with undeniable conceptual cost (“she would carry his echo in every standing ovation”). Causal linkage holds: each clap produces echo-ripples that selectively reach the actress, tightening until the coin’s spin crystallizes the transfer. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of color-echoes intensifies rather than plot-reverses—and the pattern is taught early (“synesthetic shimmer of applause painted the darkness”). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence 3.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated geode-light-resonance images tighten the stake until the canvas bloom reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the fractal tree image crystallizes options and felt cost: she will share the data, foreclosing pure skepticism. Causality is internal-pattern rather than external event chain, acceptable under the lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3, well within the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (heat-map colours, fossil pulse, cave echoes) and lets density snowball toward the choral closure. Orientation is swift; space/time anchors hold. The final image—fossil still floating beside her on the empty coast—delivers a Charged Poise that reweights the whole tapestry; the visible cost is the permanent fusion of her voice with the planet’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens intact: button density, sand, amber, and canyon echo layer until the final question reweights time itself. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—sand through open hands—that makes the cost legible without sentimental gloss. Orientation is taught early via warehouse geography; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: because he buried codes, therefore he must dig them up; because he chose mercy, therefore exile; because he brings the key, therefore courier grants passport. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—empty pocket, full heart—cost is the years of exile and the literal frostbite of excavation. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Minor slack: courier’s motive off-stage, but that is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the two needles touching reconfigure thirty-seven years of overwritten promises into one irreducible essence, and the felt cost is the silence that follows the final gutter tick—an absence born on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure intensifies via the slowing drip cadence and the matched pulse, not via causal reversals. Anchors—who/where/when—are crystalline within the first 60 words, well under the 120-word waiver threshold. No causality breaks, no prop drift; even the yarn needles are introduced before they return in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bowl-and-glass offering crystallizes the discovered rule—kindness as architecture—while the lingering thrum in her palms makes the conceptual cost bodily. Causality holds: lantern glass → thrum → bowl → departure; each beat is legibly because/therefore. The only micro-slip is “Kai understood that resistance wasn’t defiance…” summarizing what the reader already sees dramatized; since the next sentence re-grounds us in wheel and fire, the linkage stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gauge becomes invitation, not entry, reweighting legacy into liberation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each moonflower seed and scored notch layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact: petal-drop triggers trek; gauge-tooth enables furrows; moonlight consecrates. Cost is legible in the forfeited fire-escape garden and the gauge left gleaming in dirt—an unrecoverable surrender of the old vertical hold.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece teaches its pattern of echo-and-reprise early (tidal shelves, ghost-flicker) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s pulse fuses with extinct rhythms, re-weighting isolation into custodianship. Closure carries visible conceptual cost (“she is both present and echo”), but the absence of a crisp, causal trigger between sundial-touch and final fusion keeps it shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the spiral grows stanza-by-stanza, reweighting secrecy into shared art; closure lands with CR as the rain-sealed letter re-prices her anonymity. Causality is light—how the child’s stone or poet’s bowl alters her stance is implied, not shown—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the lyric-contract.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: subsonic manipulation → campus hysteria → Mara’s counter-frequency → immediate dissipation of paranoia, all on-page. The 2:47 AM spectrogram reveal is the hinge beat; every move after is therefore/ because. Closure is a Charged Poise: arguments falter, the tower stands scorched, alien signal gone, human mistrust lingering—cost legible in the silent studio. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip is “cosmic tricksters laughed” – an externalizing phrase that momentarily pops us out of Mara’s limited inference, but it is brief and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blueprint library reweights the quest from artifact to possibility; cost is the silence of the now-useless organ and her own shaken hands. Causal lens holds: each descending beat is “therefore” driven by compass geometry and sonic mapping. Orientation is clean—catacomb depth, church above, night—by line 5. Minor slip: “the city began to stir” is off-stage; still, the reconfiguration is on-page, so the quick test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage holds: ribbon find → height correction → vendor arrest; each beat tightens because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ribbon returned, quarry now “stone” not “shadow,” empathy reawakened with the felt cost of future grief she must now carry. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the quarry waited in predawn silence”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost: blindness becomes a “different kind of sight.”

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the valley camp materializes, the reversible-exile rule is repaid, and the cost—her career, perhaps her safety—radiates from the director’s silent retreat. Causal links hold: nail-pin → journal decoding → coordinate entry → eye-storm reveal. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no seams break the because/therefore chain. The final image reweights every prior map as lie, satisfying the conceptual price test.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new bridge-song crystallizes options—ashes of “never” become fertile—cost felt in the hush after last note. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of glass–scaffold–grove intensifies, cadence deepens, meaning reweighted. Orientation anchored by word 80; deliberate disorientation (pixelated world) later pays off in closure image. No teleport props; Morse-scaffold logic is taught and obeyed. Cost legible: “weight of the past lift” tied to playing.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Pine-thick air, moonlit shards, and scaffold-wrap Morse create tactile, choice-guiding environment; recurring glass flake functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Details filtered through musician’s bias: notices sound of plastic, translates flutter into location, uses fiddle as shovel. No white-room; spatial track clean from pullout → gravel path → cairn. World rules consistent; no anachronism. 9+ gate met: glass shard constrains choice and reappears to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the single blue bill on the sawdust reweights the whole train from resurrection site to relic, and the cost is palpable when Leo whispers the possibility of breaking circles. Causality is tight: each symbol (tilted hat, broken trapeze) is a because-link that finally lets Leo read the argument without a spoken confrontation. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned circus train”) and never wavers. The only minor drag is the startup flashback—it summarises stakes we already infer from the posters and symbols, so the lens stays causal but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “We carried it together” reweights every prior symbol and charges the daylilies with communal cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of star-pulse → phoneme → confession tightens once at 3:47 AM. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by word 80. No causal break; the telegram’s restored bloom is the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: failed trick → therefore seed → therefore confession released. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—mirror line reweights the premise with undeniable personal cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30; vortex, druid, night. One tightening beat—ice groans under circles—forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in the final image: berries harmless because his guilt is not.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clipping roots in her palm, re-weighting the covenant from burden to living garden. Causal linkage holds: maze topiary → scar-link ritual → ancestral memory → self-as-crossing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—roots pulsing beneath ancestral scars—narrows options to “become the intersection.” Cost is legible in the final image; lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: pinning the cloth above her desk reconfigures meaning with visible cost—she forfeits pure detachment—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is intact, but the beat is slightly under-escalated relative to the public failure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the city steadies while Elara’s ambition is re-priced from exact proof to braided witness. Causality is causal-track clean: each carved wedge re-directs the arbor’s field; the seed warms in proportion, making the final hum legible. The cost—her ambition permanently re-shaped—is visible when she “let the fruit fall into the clouds” and names herself witness, not author.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the half-transmuted creel persists as “question not data,” reweighting the Archive’s premise. Cost is legible—“quiet triumph of refusal” + lunar migration pain—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern of tidal retreat → geothermal gradient → moon-pull is taught early and charges final image without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the townspeople suddenly hear inherited regrets through HVAC vents—undeniable social cost—while Mara’s own future is foreclosed by her unsanctioned act. The lens is Accumulative: each etched confession layers density until the crystal pillar re-broadcasts; causality is intact (she reads → she speaks → system sings). Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Bunker 7,” “quartz-dusted walls,” “thirty years”). The final image reweights the premise: bunkers are no longer tombs but amplifiers; cost is legible in the instant she forfeits official duty.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: station ivy, bellows, graffiti, and map circles accrue associative weight until the final “song you learn to play again” reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; spatial logic holds as Mira moves platform → waiting room → bathroom → bench → tracks. Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks into night carrying “map references…imprinted,” a stasis that forecloses the old guilt-loop and costs her the bellows talisman. Causal linkage is thin—graffiti coincidence is the main turn, not an earned reversal—so escalation feels atmospheric, not consequential, keeping the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: spiral watch, reversed stairs, thickening mist accumulate a pattern of cyclical return rather than causal because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she releases the silence, the glow merges with mist, time resets—conceptual cost legible in "the time between them was now a story documented in delay." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dreamlike yet taught early and paid off in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second letter arrives and she chooses release over reading. No slips touching closure; could reach 9.0 if the renunciation were moored to a prior embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence and image density tighten toward the seed-planting image that reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unbroken circle in the coffee stain and the new shoot refract Lira’s forfeiture of funding into tangible hope. Orientation is anchored by sentence 3; transitions are legible under a single scene. Cost is felt yet mildly abstract—“mulberry ache softened into quiet certainty”—stopping just short of visceral punch required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is announced in the second sentence—cosmic static as text—and holds to the last auroral shift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the gem’s “winter jasmine bloomed forever” reweights all prior chips and patterns with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is pattern-based, not sequential, but still legible; the droplet transfer beat is dramatized, not summarized. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within fifty words—no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the jam-spread sunrise reweights the entire vineyard cycle—contentment is not in magic but in tending. Causal lens holds: each scalloped prune narrows future options until the final refusal to bottle memory-wine. Orientation anchors by word 40 (yew, Umbral Grotto, cloud-sea). Felt cost is unmistakable: she trades immortal vintage for perishable jam, Aria’s laughter echoing in stone.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the shard’s spectrum reweights the rule-set, making certainty impossible, and the cost is felt in the narrator’s loosened cloak and open-ended promise. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chime, smoke wisp, and colour band thickens the texture until the final prism crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse, dawn, rocky path). Keeper’s voice drifts down without prior spatial cue, a minor teleport, but the effect is lyrical, not causal-breaking. Persistent constraint—the shard’s void—shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ripple imagery increases until the final ring-fade reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira’s silhouette dissolving into starlight—whose conceptual cost (she must vanish to appear) is undeniable and irreversible. The withheld-clue pattern is taught early (“Mira withheld the final clue”) and paid off when the water’s stillness reconfigures the reader’s understanding. Persistent constraint: backward aging that deletes memory shapes every tactic and the final forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wandering pulse becomes an internal compass, reweighting stillness as true travel. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—harmonics layer until pattern breaks into revelation—but the single on-page cost is purely perceptual; no object or relationship is forfeited, muting the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vorrin’s quiet refusal converts the mission into permanent self-sacrifice, creating a before/after legible in the final mist-image. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence of dying-light repetitions tightens the stake until the last paragraph reweights “lingering luminance” as his own heartbeat. Cost is on-page: “his own light dimming to match its rhythm.” Orientation clear by 50-word mark; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “color of silence = clear brilliant white” reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: key-tag found → descent → log read → silence color discovered; each step narrows options toward final poise. Cost is felt—he forfeits dry safety and human soundscape. Lantern drift past porthole supplies the decisive image that crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coins dissolve into unity, her wavelength merges with the collapsed cosmos, cost is the perpetual absence of certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of static → coins → silence deepens meaning each cycle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught inside 50 words and payoff at ending justifies early lyric compression. One minor scaffold: “she must wavelength align with purpose or dissolve” restates prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unnamed fear crystallizes into a mirror that refracts her own face, reweighting the premise that naming saves others but never her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cylinder/beast adds density until the atlas page becomes a ledger of traded griefs. Persistent constraint (her surrendered name) shapes every prior choice, and the cost is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell’s last hum reconfigures sea silence into “promises of future fish” and Kael’s naivety into “quiet strength,” both legible on the page. Causal chain—drip timing → bell resonance → fish flicker—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“sapphire viaduct gleamed under first light”). Cost is the mage’s exhaustion: “lukewarm magic spent.” Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until the final tone reweights the world.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lantern-lit table becomes the valley’s new public record; the mirrored reservoir now reflects a contaminated truth, not just stars. Causal chain holds: label → photos → memory → rewrite, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible: Nora shoulders the “weight of the past” and forecloses her own silence—earned stasis with social price.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: pattern recognition而非causal chains drives the turn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she awakens with “spirals and starlight,” reweighting prior binaries without physical action. Cost is felt (crystal shatters, predecessors lost), but price is conceptual more than personal on-page; a hair more visceral forfeiture would secure 8+. Orientation clean; transitions taught by starling murmuration.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: manual override locks, tether stabilizes, guardian returns to vigil—cost is implied (eternal watch) but not dramatized. Causal chain is thin: “tether failing” → revise sequence → vibration confirms fix; no intermediate obstacle or knowledge twist. Orientation clean by 120 w; no teleport props; world rules (floating arbor, data vines) stay consistent. Lens is situational-ritual; pattern holds, yet escalation plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive CR: the brain dissolves into his chest, reweighting the rule-set—feeling is no longer the enemy but the price of existence. Causal chain holds under Hybrid lens: timeline fracture → clones appear → vivify circuit → paradox resolves. Orientation anchors (floating rock, three clones, jar) arrive by line 3; no debt applied. Cost is legible in the final image—“tears cutting salt trails”—and persists as constraint for future teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical return of “orthogonal”/“storm-born silence” thickens texture rather than causality, and the final Charged Poise (moonlit sprout) reweights innovation as sacred duty. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. Closure cost is felt conceptually but not as lived price, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; orientation is clean. Accumulative lens holds: each cord-yank thickens sonic texture, re-weighting grief’s silence until laughter finally cracks upstairs; closure is the charged hush that follows, felt cost legible as Eleanor thins. Causal logic accepted under after-life conceit; pattern taught early (cord + tunnel = wind music). Minor slack: absence of stakes test for “too-much wind” risk keeps closure shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: “home was a way of waiting” re-weights exile as self-chosen poetics; cost is the pendant’s cold weight against flesh. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of licking/reading/folding intensifies until meaning itself is redefined. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored by “single, snow-locked courtyard” at 60 words. The only drag is a touch of loop-phrase (“waiting was no longer…” thrice) but it does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frozen bloom reweights the rule-set—embers neither ash nor flame—with undeniable conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each failed transmutation increases density until the pattern breaks at the sacrificed certainty. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ember nexus”), twilight, fractured altar. Persistent constraint: the crozier’s absence becomes more powerful than presence, shaping the final walk-away.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the shard rewires the tower’s purpose from broadcast to listening, a visible reconfiguration with felt cost (“she would teach them to listen”). Causal chain holds—discard amplifiers → bare-wire contact → seed-pattern recorded—though the mentor’s aphorism acts as external leverage rather than on-page cause. Lunar perigee functions as accumulative pressure, not coincidence, tightening the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry’s triple-existence snap solidifies timelines with the hourglass-fulcrum image, cost felt in the “permanence settling on her shoulders.” Causality holds under Hybrid lens—radio pulses → grotto response → hull flicker—though the merge rule is taught rather than foreshadowed. Orientation is clear by 120 words (who: Lina, where: Tidemark deck, when: seventh-tide night). The sideways clock motif pays off at closure, waiving disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: Mira’s empty hands reweight the premise that connection cannot be grasped, only felt. Causal linkage holds—every knot she ties tightens until the false splice triggers the upward flood; her release is therefore inevitable and costly. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early via sinew density and pattern cadence, held to final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (marble floors, mirror frame) appear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each echo of “edge geometry” and starlight accretes until the anchor’s rust map reweights meaning; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Corin’s bioluminescent Ursa Major—where the cost is felt: starlight becomes internal, unreachable yet navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the misprision of ghost-pulse → living heart creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise under an Accumulative lens. Causality is tight: each hearing-aid adjustment tightens the misreading until the glass crash externalizes the mistake. Orientation is swift (mist-clad atrium, twilight, alone) within 60 words. One minor loop: “reeling hush” is repeated without pattern justification, but it does not dent the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat moves because/therefore from hatch seal to terminal touch; the 47-minute tide window is taught early and narrows options to the final seven-second sync. The climactic renunciation (no data stolen, only witness paid) lands with conceptual cost as the gold flecks dim—an earned stasis that forecloses retrieval. Minor waver: facility map remains skeletal, but spatial drift never muddies the terminal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: clerical error → observatory trip → ink defrag → shard spark → ghost voice → self-mend. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“opal observatory rose from the snow”). Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the shard goes cold, cost legible as “private metronome” now tuned to universe, not machine. No teleporting props; porcelain tracked from pocket to screen. Escalation tightens once—ghost’s whisper shifts from static to map—sufficient for 700-word window. Persistent constraint: heartbeat-counting continues after exit, proving price sticks.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the diamond now sings a voice-without-ears, a conceptual repricing that makes the extinction of the language irreversible yet newly animate. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each repetition of echo, copper, fracture, and flock layers density until the final cadence shift (“a memorial that needed no mourners”) crystallizes the cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“spiraling bone tower… sun that remembered no names”) and stays legible throughout; no teleporting props or causal breaks. The persistent constraint—no remaining speakers—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image of verdigris dust beside a singing stone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static whispers → arrowhead → gravity dance → communal levity tightens the stake from personal grief to participatory cosmic joke. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single closure image of Lyn “delighted punchline” reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—she is now instrument, not observer. The causal chain is lyrical rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final echo-laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each violin iteration therefore cracks statues → clocktower counter-pulse therefore endangers Elara → she therefore transmutes self into bridge. Setup orients who/where within 60 words; locust shell arrival at ~300 words is causal hinge, not coincidence. Closure—orchard sings, statues breathe, Elara dust-coated—lands as charged poise with felt cost (her heartbeat forever realigned). Minor clarity wobble: “gap between knowing and understanding” is repeated refrain but never re-defined, so conceptual repricing is fractionally less sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: failed vow → nightly ritual → bottle invention → drone flight → mother’s closure. The storm-bottle both masks the drone and carries the daughter’s voice, a satisfying double payoff. One soft spot: the arcade owner’s scrap of paper appears as a late additive rather than a planted set-up, slightly diluting seamless causality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the train layers density until the halo fragment reframes the silence. Causality is loose—wrong turn → oasis → fragment—but pattern is taught early (“each dawn to the same stubborn bolt”) so the coincidence is accepted as fated texture rather than plot cheat. Closure is a Charged Poise: carousel turns, mist becomes “shimmering quiet,” cost is the vocal breath he can never retrieve, felt in the final wind-bell echo. Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props; beats tighten once, cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the mirror-cover of the zeroth volume reflects origins, not faces, and the library exhales a synchronised page-turn that reweights every narrative in the building. Causality is accumulative/textural: scarf-folding deepens shelf curvature until a threshold literally unfolds; the “because” is topological, not social. Orientation is taught early (3:17 AM, hyperbolic aisles) and pays off when parallel lines meet in the final couplet. One minor slip: the corduroy man’s late arrival inside the portal is unmotivated, a fractal rather than a causal beat, but it does not break the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty well becomes “perfect cipher of longing,” reweighting the premise that capture = loss. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pattern of capture/release cycles taught early, cadence deepening until the final luminous absence. Cost is legible in the forever-empty well that “shone brighter than others,” a persistent constraint shaping future dawns. Causality remains intact: each sunrise photograph and brush-stroke directly enables the dream’s voluntary return.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed idea drifts into the client while Merrin stays keyless, cost legible in “improbable longing that tasted of starlight.” Causal chain holds: star-angle → keyhole shadow → ritual disorientation → idea released. Orientation anchors within 120 words: twilight nexus, locksmith shop with no sign, first Thursday client. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (twilight = cosmic lock-picking) and pays off. Persistent constraint set: Merrin can only unlock others, never herself—this shapes every beat and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mosaic four-shard structure is taught by line 3 (“forty years after”), transitions are legible with anchored dates, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of wreck/celestial imagery reweights the stake until the Pleiad is locked shut. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing mushroom on the mast reconfigures meaning, undeniable cost in “he would never return again.” One causality hairline: “habit of forgetting finally broke” is asserted, not sourced in scene, but the break is dramatized immediately after, so the ellipsis is allowable under motivated compression.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she seals the shard, foreclosing return with visible cost—“who would teach you to read the leaves?” spoken over trembling hands. Causal chain holds: annotation → shadow recognition → mentor choice, each because/therefore legible. Orientation anchored by 110 words: empty swing, moss-stone library, backward gait. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nameless color from the cracked seed reweights the rules of wonder itself, with the permanent “hush” and sap-stain as visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence layers (thread, song, sap) tighten until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 30; disorientation serves the lyric hush later paid off. No causality break; the reversed waterfall heartbeat is a taught pattern, not a cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the net’s empty weave becomes a map of named souls, reframing her lifelong shame into architecture. Accumulative lens holds: each unraveled knot intensifies spectral density until the pearl condenses silence into tangible birth. The mentor’s warned prohibition pays off as persistent constraint—she becomes the threadbare thing, willingly. Cost is legible in the final image: starlight passing through the open weave = forgiveness she can now transmit.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver thread across the tear reweights the whole premise—maps now carry audible silence. Causal lens holds throughout: because the tear intersects the henge, therefore Elena investigates; because she compares silent videos, therefore she detects the seam; because she presses, the chapel reopens. Cost is legible in the final image—the map is forever bifurc yet re-bound, a conceptual repricing of knowledge vs. reverence. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared immediately (“water pressed against the hull like an old regret”) and held to the last line, with each sensory density increment reweighting the same stake: how to carry absence. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the globe moves from “singularity of memory” to “artifact,” a reclassification that costs the illusion that measurement could dissolve feeling. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff is the final ascent, leaving orientation debt fully waived. The only hairline slip is the single explanatory line “That was the paradox he was trying to solve,” but it is embedded inside an active observation beat, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    Ambient lyricism substitutes for causal linkage: the courtyard, bolt plate, and ghost code keep re-appearing in lush sentences, but the “because/therefore” spine is loose—beats advance by atmospheric drift more than by tightening choice. Closure offers luminous uplift yet no on-page price or path foreclosed; the mist simply dissolves, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration form but at low personal cost. Orientation is clear early; transitions are smooth, satisfying Track A. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the lack of a decisive, irreversible turn caps the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Kai sets the goggles down on the empty desk, an image that crystallizes servant-hood transformed into witnessed soulmate—cost is the impossibility of reciprocation now that the beloved is dead. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: each floor adds a layer of decrypted memory that re-weights the present silence rather than forcing external turns. Orientation anchors—who (servant), where (glass elevator in ice spire), when (afternoon sun break)—arrive by line 6; no penalty. No causal break: the goggles’ optical trick is set up by early mention of “brass-rimmed lenses” and pays off in the same paragraph it is used. Cost is unmistakable: “a familiar cloak—grief present, but tempered” shows the price is lifelong carrying of unreturnable love.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each spool, cloud-name and groan of iron layers density until the gondola itself becomes a tape-head reading the “quiet, explosive” confession. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cradle-gondola finds new equilibrium in the cloud named “acceptance,” reweighting the premise—atmosphere, not institution, is the true archive. Cost is legible in the tethered canister and the live decision to speak Thorne’s erased cause of death into the night air; the reader feels the foreclosed future of her career, her body, her breath.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lattice holds: hopscotch coordinates → phrasebook → valley → luminance → map, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise: the airship sails on, Elara’s voice now “both lifted and anchored,” a crystallized reconfiguration of her solitude with cartographer’s authority. Cost is felt in the final image—the phrasebook tucked away, path foreclosed. One micro-turn (discovery of coordinates) is sufficient; no orientation debt; lens is clean causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the amber shift in the mirrors is an undeniable Resonant Reconfiguration—time's flow is literally re-tinted, costing the hall its haunted stasis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each mirrored fragment adds nostalgic density until the gear-catalyst pattern breaks into living motion. Cost is legible in the final image: "the driftwood nostalgia settled into a quiet peace"—a conceptual repricing that forfeits eternal regret for transient warmth. No orientation drift; the crystal-shard library and crescent keyhole are anchored by word 80, well inside the 120-word grace window.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative lens: lyric montage of orchard life, ghost clues, bell ritual. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—spiral reframes hope as tangled—yet cost is cosmological, not personal; no named character forfeits a concrete want. Causality remains poetic rather than tactical; scarcity threat is announced but never squeezes a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock stops counting and simply “is,” the puppet head becomes timeless light, and the adjuster’s stance crystallizes into Earned Stasis—she will sleep inside the silence she forged. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each spiral traced, each crack refracted, tightens the pattern until the final geometric collapse. Cost is visible in the dissolution of the toy and her own stillness against cold stone. Orientation is taught early (“the spiral stairs… at dusk”) and the pane of hush is immediately legible as lens-rule, so no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: three travelers appear → Elara must act → each nut-shadow shifts bird patrols → frost deadline → safe exit. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of her gathering the worn-smooth nut reweights every prior act of reluctant grace, showing the perpetual cost of inherited duty. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (orchard on cliff, dusk), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: foam pattern → polymer insight → lab bridge; each image layer thickens meaning until the final “hummed harmonic” reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“braided ravine”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the river’s merged ribbon reconfigures Elena’s stance and the polymer film literally sings the cost. Minor slack: the sister’s death is told more than shown, so the causal engine is the foam epiphany rather than a prior because/therefore chain; under Accumulative rules this is acceptable, but keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vendor’s self-exile in “radiantly empty” threshold space reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of incisions → harvested silence → vendor’s own withheld incision. Orientation is taught early by floating library and bottled moonlight; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: the vendor bottles silence for herself, sealing her perpetual outsider stance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tidal pool pattern layers density until the coral pavilion’s last exhalation reweights the chef’s vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise—bread tomorrow will carry irreducible daughter-hand—conceptual cost legible without exposition. Orientation is swift: broken-tooth fortress, chef-taster, woman’s silent gravity all within 60 words. No causality breaks; the because is the accrual of sorrow-geometries that force him to become storage.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the town’s sonic segregation is audibly rewired, cost legible in elders’ tears and children’s mispronunciations. Causality is accumulative/textural—each elevator refrain layers until the clock catches the rhythm—so the “because” is pattern, not single choice. Orientation is clear by line 4; transitions between elevator visits are legible shards. One non-closure slip: the railroad tracks are declared as impassable yet never tested or crossed, so the metaphor stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final sentence reweights the premise—"all canyons are ultimately mind"—with undeniable ontological cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror-fracture beat adds density until the canyon itself undergoes "geological synaptic plasticity," a tightening that forecloses the option of detached observation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("canyon's rim") and the pattern of moonlit memory deposits is taught early and paid off in the last paragraph. Persistent constraint: the mirror’s fractures remain warm, a literalized price that shapes the final image of her fragmented futures.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: she secures the combinations and escapes as gravity rights, a decisive change with felt time-pressure. Causality is mostly because/therefore (prism reveals → she goes → records → flees), but the grotto’s “only when gravity inverts” rule is asserted, not earned by prior world-logic. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography tracks. The lens holds as situational-pressure; no retro-patching, but luck (the hour arrives tonight) rather than agency triggers entry.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure earns a Charged Poise: the grove “singing inside silence” reweights the world’s quietude as receptive rather than empty; cost is felt conceptually, aligning with Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchor (grove, dawn, lone sculptor) surfaces ~140 words—just late enough to require a −0.3 dip. Because/therefore logic is loose (porcelain simply “awakens” rather than yielding knowledge through trial), but the tightening cadence of dawn→lantern→night sustains legible momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: releasing the stone rewrites the exile from shame into gift, cost legible in the erased footprints. Accumulative lens holds—magnetic fragments and memory shards layer until the pattern crystallizes. Orientation is taught early by compasses spinning wild, waived penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unlocked diary and neighbor’s arrival reconfigure solitude into shared stillness; cost is the father’s revealed absence and Mira’s renunciation of secrecy. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each frequency shift thickens pattern until the clasp yields. Orientation is swift; no lens drift. Slight slack: fireworks’ coincidence doesn’t tighten further, capping high band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s foul lesson reweights the premise—serenity is born of decay—and the village’s new gait is the visible cost. Causal chain is lean: grind seed → tincture → drink → shared calm; no teleporting props. The “tide’s thought” moon-phase rule is taught early and returns to frame the final whisper, so lens holds. One soft spot: the elders’ mass sipping is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: satellite warning → launch → water-flow navigation → seed contact → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 50; gravity-rule is taught early and repaid at closure when the same inversion ends with “soft sigh.” The single tightening inside the arch narrows options—release controls or fall out—creating felt cost. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: resilience re-priced as growth through dying, not around it; the price is the family’s forever-changed pruning practice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mapped wind “fingerprints” reconfigure future risk with conceptual cost. Causal chain (gust → crash → mapping) holds, but the decisive beat is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost is implied, not felt on the body or page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the sculpted hush literally cracks, wonder spills as “luminous tide,” and the aurora keeps dancing after the bells fall silent—cost felt in the endless upkeep Lyra now shoulders. Causal linkage is clean: chisel cue → bell sequence → hush fracture. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of color-sound imagery tightens until the pattern break releases wonder. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity or artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seam he opened re-weights failure from barrier to doorway; the image of the flute “warm against his chest” makes the new constraint tangible. Causal chain holds—because he plays, reality fractures; therefore he must carry the burden of both key and lock—without telegraphing. Orientation is anchored by word 60; driftwood pattern and echo-location teach the reader how to read the range. Lens (Causal) stays clean to the final stride home.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the equation in the notebook is crossed out and replaced by a living flux, a reweighting of the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via star extinction and fragment decay until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“topaz workshop”) and the pattern of vanishing stars pays off in the last line. Cost is legible in the spent fragment, the blank sky, and the self-confessed failure of linear emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: aurora pulses and pendant hums layer density until the sprout’s green flame reweights the stake. One clean transition (ridge→observatory) and a resonant closure—pendant planted, tree grown—deliver Charged Poise with conceptual cost: routine becomes myth. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no lens ambiguity. The mentor fade is backstory, but it is cued by pendant vibration and paid off in the final image, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns, prism light, and quartz inhalation tighten the same stake rather than chaining causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—the arbor’s “less solid” after-image and her empty hands reconfigure the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 4; the 7-year backstory is brief and anchored to the present cue of colleagues’ contempt, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty weave and vanished bead reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence thickens by density loops until the final cadence shift. Causality is interior—each surrender compresses time into amber—but motive remains legible. No orientation debt; bamboo orchard and loom are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the arches crack → Ren acts; because the silk responds to arch-stone → barter is possible; because rings dissolve → arches seal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: copper taste in fruit and clang “of azure defiance” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s vanishing reweights her life into perpetual guardianship, cost legible in “compass” image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pulse, murmur, ripple, echo—pattern taught early and held to last line. Causality is soft: shard “demands” action, rift “would swallow,” but no concrete rule explains why multiversal weave works; we accept via lyric contract. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) satisfied by line 4; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clear: lamp fails → finds glowing sea-glass → bottles it + letter → relights lamp; closure lands as Earned Stasis with the bottle left for the chain, cost legible in the final image. Orientation is swift, transitions clean, yet the ghost’s agency and the stone-message mechanics are told more than tested, keeping the turn modest.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pattern of light→shadow→prophecy is taught early and reweights meaning at the end. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the emerald glow and dawn image reconfigure the world’s digital fog, cost felt conceptually. No persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics—her power is celebrated, never taxed. Orientation is clear; causality is poetic parallelism rather than tight because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure relies on a conceptual reweighting (becoming “the space between beats”) rather than an on-page decisive act; cost is asserted, not dramatized. Drive lens is lyric-accumulative: sun-trail imagery returns to re-tint perception, satisfying the Accumulative test, yet the because/therefore chain is loose—the stranger arrives because…story magnetism? Orientation drifts: “three moons ago” is the single time-stamp; valley/rock/tea-house spatial logic never constrains action. Mosaic shards (visitor tales, child’s first words) accumulate texture but feel interchangeable; pattern taught only via metaphor, not causality. Final image (valley mist meeting house) lands Charged Poise, but the lack of an earlier price or foregone option keeps the reconfiguration light.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the map’s reveal is the Decisive Change, the sorrow threads visibly rewoven into light that opens the garden door. Causality is lyric—moonlight heals glass, light draws map—but each step is anchored in prior image (salt-stink brass, cracked lens). Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure cost is the foreclosure of endless corridors: she can now sweep toward revelation, not mere dust.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard basks in perpetual dawn while Elias becomes “a whisper,” a felt conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each sung note pulls memory away, tightening until the mica shatters; the pattern is taught early (“each leaf a fragment”). Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The lens holds without contradiction, though the dawn-thread mechanic is slightly convenient; the image of fractured glass letting in true sunrise reweights meaning cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor of light re-weights every prior paradox so that “staying while leaving” becomes shareable. Causality holds: the invitation’s reappearance at 11:47 triggers the mirror realization, which in turn triggers the door at 11:59. Cost is legible—she irreversibly abandons the safety of the shop’s absolute solitude. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of nested contradictions tightens until the final image crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story tightens by density and cadence: each vanished object (gates, bakery, sourdough) accrues into a pattern of communal surrender. The breadcrumb-soil scattering is a decisive micro-turn that reweights the stake from private memory to shared witness; the cost is the irrevocable consumption of the last relic. Transitions are legible within the single-scene window; spatial anchors (ivy-choked fountain, yew-shadowed tea house) are fixed by word 120. No causality break; the final image crystallizes options: perpetual tending is now the only viable future.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early—each lantern flicker equals one memory shard—so orientation is secure by 50 words. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the vow’s frequency is re-injected, shelves glow, but the quartz hush reminds us the fix is fragile; cost is felt in the “temporary ward” admission. Causality is lyric-associative rather than strict because/therefore, yet the final image reweights all prior beats, satisfying Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the recorder locked back in the beam and the fob’s tick crystallize a new, fragile stasis—trust broken yet truce preserved. Causal chain holds: fob→compartment→rewire→capture; each step forecloses alternatives. The sunrise deadline tightens the final moment, and the cost (perpetual unease, silence she must now carry) is legible in the last line. Minor drift: the “sound of trust breaking” is conceptually repeated without new inflection at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transfer of the ring reweights knowledge— consensus becomes internalized, not artifacted. Causal chain holds: each taste notes a real electoral beat; ring’s relinquishment is the because/therefore pivot. Orientation anchor (“lavender bluff”) arrives by word 10; no penalty. Lens stays Accumulative; density, not twist, drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the lock refuses the dial-turn, therefore she transposes the rhythm into percussive tapping; because the shackle snaps, therefore the painting lifts and the charcoal bundle appears. Orientation anchors (who= Elena the artist; where= crystal cave; when= after laughter dies) arrive before 120 words. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she begins the first dawn-line on stone, foreclosing permanent silence. One shard only; no teleport or amnesia; stakes tighten exactly once—lock opens → art must resume.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each magnetic reel adds density of candor until the climactic playback of her own voice reframes stakes; the ending’s Charged Poise—the reel on the desk, gold leaf brushed across the label—reweights the premise with conceptual cost: she must keep choosing candor or wilt. No causal leaps; transitions are legible, closure lands on page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph layers a new medium—iceberg fragment, wind-driven beams, color return—until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the child’s touch reframes preservation as transmission, costing the tuner her remaining pigment. Orientation is taught immediately (“whispering bluff before dawn”), transitions are legible, no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each magnetically induced jitter adds sensory density until the burn becomes the inevitable cadence shift. Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration—”Emma’s fire” logged privately—where the android’s new coordinate is inward, cost paid in the emptied box and the dome’s 47° re-alignment. Causality is tight: the glitching safety override is set up by the magnetic drift, then exploited; no beat is teleported. The final line reweights the whole pattern without explanatory throat-clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: locket → key → address → mailbox → letters chain logically; each discovery tightens options until the bulldozer arrival tests the stakes. Closure is earned and costly—Elena inherits the caretaker role, Mira forfeits anonymity, the courtyard becomes a historic site—so Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost is on-page. One minor causality warp: Samir’s grandmother sleep-talks the exact cue “where the jasmine blooms white,” a convenience not seeded earlier, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each roll → dance → system response tightens options until the flood liberates. Closure is a CR—water re-prisons the lab but frees her, cost legible in the drowned tomb she leaves behind. The sunken-lab orientation is taught early and pays off, so Orientation Test waived. One micro template cadence (“She wrote…she rolled…she performed”) slightly dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the wildflowers-keyed crystal fracture restores Mara’s violet memory, reweighting the world’s rule that deleted memories are irretrievable. Cost is legible in Kael’s exhausted stumble and the new quiet of the lanterns. Causal lens holds: every beat (coffee map → fifth piling → chamber → crystal → home) is linked by therefore/because. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is clean: the final crane dipped in water triggers the decisive hush that rewrites the brook’s song—visible before/after with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: 27 cranes → inverted flow → silence rewrites prophecy; no teleporting rules. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who/where/when). The single causality worry: the “terrestrially cosmic” rule is never materialized—it reads as decorative adjective rather than constraint—so the universe-level stakes feel declared, not proven, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the seal’s fresh imprint rewrites the ward’s erased text, reconfiguring Alex’s role from visitor to scribe while the building “shivers.” Causality is clean—weekly tea → hidden history → Mrs. Voss chips plaster → meteor cue → basement act—each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation anchors (7B, Tuesday November move-in, rooftop garden) arrive by line 5 and hold. Cost is visible in wet plaster and in Mrs. Voss’s exposure of her life’s covert work; the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each velvet petal, phosphorescent moss flake, and shell echo thickens the membrane until the final cadence shift releases the archive without a causal twist. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught in the first 25 words and paid off when the same garden at dawn reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “She was still alone, but the ghostly resolve had become her own” crystallizes options—bridge crossed, path foreclosed—cost felt in the cold, silent shell. No causality breaks; resonance structures obey their own taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: incomplete scroll ➜ forgery ➜ hidden script ➜ altar key ➜ disc unlink. The “key with no apparent lock” is seeded early (grandmother’s phrase) and pays off mechanically at climax, satisfying closure with conceptual cost: tyranny’s seal literally spins itself impotent. Aurora light as both cloak and reveal is taught fast; orientation secured within 60 words. One soft spot: the off-stage “people whisper” coda is told, not shown, slightly diluting the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon murmurs the sung name, the shell falls silent, and stance crystallizes—“keeper of echoes.” Cost is conceptual (eternal melancholy) but not felt on the page; no prior beat shows what she forfeits by accepting the role. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off, yet the single causal tightening is the off-stage decision to “sing it into the canyon,” un-shown. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty, but the missing dramatized turn caps entry to the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard (shrine, dream analysis, wreck dive) layers density until the pristine globe delivers the resonant reconfiguration. Causality is poetic rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early via the “windows of connection” refrain and lands with undeniable conceptual cost—Elias’s peace is purchased by Maya’s lifelong vigil of listening to strangers’ dreams. The melted globe → intact globe reprise reweights meaning without a hard plot turn, satisfying Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a gentle CR—village culture reweighted toward valuing invisible labor—yet the causal chain is loose: Kael’s sudden competence and the villagers’ wordless adoption arrive without setbacks or price, so the “before/after” feels more asserted than forced.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the same diamond reweighted from curse to key, forcing settlers to choose complicity or escape. Causal chain holds—letters → geothermal vents → orchard survival → Elias’s map of distortion—each because/therefore step tightening options until he can intuit the hatch without stealing. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words: “mulberry roots… lee of Old Mountain… radioactive dust.” Persistent constraint: the storm wall already gathering on the horizon will test his revelation the moment he speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Atlas listens, therefore he learns the prophet-child, therefore he broadcasts, therefore dawn changes. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—his empty observatory becomes the first verse of new mythology—cost legible in “his loneliness finally a kind of company.” Orientation anchored by word 60 (“cobalt glass portico… three miles above”). No telegraphing or outline drift; every beat advances stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the loft becomes a singing library, the pennies replaced by wind-carried verses—cost is the irrevocable exposure of her private archive. Causality holds: each jar originates in a concrete prior action (wax seal, paperclip wind-up) and the final release is the sum of those choices. Lens is accumulative/textural; pattern of collected sound-drops tightens until the solstice symphony reweights meaning. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: locked ice → key strike → vibrational duel → dissolution of guardian → self-reconfiguration. Each therefore-link narrows options until the ice bridge of sound becomes the only path. The guardian’s release and her re-tuned heart are on-page Decisive Change with felt cost. No teleporting props or soft resets; the crypt key’s earlier clang pays off in the coat-button harmonic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final pulse releases the network-quieting magnetic surge, a conceptual repricing that makes the community’s newfound mental quiet legible and irreversible. Causality holds—every beat links lunar azimuth → flux → pulse → silence—so the Accumulative lens is coherent. The cost is felt in Elara’s caged urgency released, not erased; the “restrained wildness” is the price she continues to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each rust measurement, photograph, and unanswered call tightens options until the decisive upload severs Voss’s leash. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when anchored within 40 words—and the underground-railroad symbol teaches the pattern that pays off when the same lantern lights her exit. Closure lands with visible cost: her career, safety, and anonymity are forfeit the moment the files leave her phone. The final image—water dripping where drought had reigned—reprises the opening beat and reweights the premise: silence has ended.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired box plays, re-weighting the premise—apology becomes artifact, not absolution—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: shattered gears → artisan’s labor → audible melody → chaplain’s altered vocation, each beat adding density until the final chord re-prices grace as ongoing labor. Cost is legible in the last line: “the harder work of living with what was understood.” No orientation or lens ambiguity past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the resonator’s backward/forward peal is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the entire premise; cost is felt in the acid light reflected on the hull and in her irreverent grin—she has helped birth something that may kill them. Causal chain is intact: arrow → kaleidoscope feed → algorithm maturation → buoyancy theft → harmonic achieved. Orientation anchor appears by line 5; no disorientation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (nightly feedings, groans through pipes) and paid off in final cadence shift “eternally ringing.” No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The text teaches an Accumulative/Textural pattern early—numbers threading through logs—and closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror-upload reweights the stake ("a beacon for anyone searching") while the patch-in-sleeve images the cost of her new vigil. Causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the density increase of the digits and songs legitimately reconfigure meaning. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint (corporate power to erase) shapes her tactics throughout. Cost is felt in the final "rare brightness" that acknowledges perpetual endangerment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reconstituted crystal hovers above the boy’s palm, re-weighting every prior image of fracture. Causal chain holds—mirrors teach method, blood pays cost, community stance crystallizes—without retro-patching. The “weighted breath” tightens once, then exhales in an image that makes future fracture legible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: cadence of mirrored ice / wind / lace images reweights stake toward continuation. Closure is a Charged Poise—moonlit silver path, new role accepted—but the hinge is soft: the realization “endings were merely pauses” is narrated, not forced by a decisive beat. No causal linkage shows why disaster-volunteerism flips her death plan; coincidence of finding one smiling photo substitutes for earned pivot. Cost is atmospheric, not felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory echoes and parallel-hunting build density toward the sealed letter. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lamp-lit letter on the table reweights the vineyard’s mismatched rows as a communal offering. Cost is conceptual—his solitude is now purposeful—yet the moment is quiet; hence high-7s, not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the “one last photograph” completes a living circle, reweighting the entire field as a forever-unfolding rite. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern (photo arcs = lavender rows) taught early, cadence deepens with each returning season, and the final image crystallizes the unfinishable nature of collective healing. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the archivist and town are condemned to perpetual, iterative remembering. No orientation debt; space-time anchors (widow, child, stone altar) are refreshed every ~100 words, keeping the drift legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: crystal testimonies layer density until silence reweights meaning. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands when he accepts erasure and walks toward chained doors; conceptual cost—his absence from the record—stings. Every beat obeys because/therefore: discovering sonic property → cataloguing → revelation of self-erasure → frantic reading → surrender. No prop or motive teleport; orientation anchored within first 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snapped chalk and remaining spiral reconfigure the stake—he can’t keep the echo, only let it go. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each driftwood marker, tape, and chalk line thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift (“let the tide carry him home”). Orientation is taught by image within 120 w; no因果 breaks. Cost is legible in the snapped chalk and fading sound. Meets 9- gate for closure but lens repetition could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf’s cadence reweights the clock and steady observatory, cost is the luminous ache Kael now carries. Causal lens holds—each gear adjustment is a because/therefore tied to the earlier leaf capture. Orientation (lunar observatory above clouds, who/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty. Escape-velocity concept is thematic echo only; it never narrows tactical options, so escalation is mild, not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: automaton key → loops → seal; each because/therefore step narrows options until shadows are channelled into the pocket. Closure lands as conceptual repricing—noon now literally shadowless—felt cost is the world’s altered optics. One micro-turn (reversed serpent) tightens the circuit. Orientation is immediate; no prop or rule drifts. The only stretch is the off-stage “sealed awakening,” but its threat is validated by the ritual’s success.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: tooth arrival → confrontation → offer to rewrite narrative. The decisive change is Elena’s open surrender of professional identity (“It means undoing everything I’ve built”) with the concrete price of reputation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 4; no penalty. Closure line “make something better from the bones of what we broke” crystallizes new, hazardous collaboration—conceptual repricing with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square’s constellation of pearls reweights the premise with conceptual cost—light without fire now communal property. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden becomes a sanctuary for broken truth-tellers, re-weighting her whistle-blowing from public ruin to generative legacy. The cost is felt in the final image—“single bee navigate the ruins with infinite care”—quiet but undeniable. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each moss spiral equals one post-confession day, pattern growth = time served. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One non-closure slip: “tomorrow she would begin documenting” flirts with future cheat, but the final beat stays present.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ghost-cameo thickens the density of abandoned hopes until the shell-crack releases them, reweighting the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—hope returns to wild mist—whose conceptual cost (he will never wake) is undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dreamlike but taught by ~100 words and serve the final image; no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the "blueprint" fog gift is lovely yet never recurs; it doesn’t break the pattern but slightly dilutes the shell’s monopoly on meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the arbor exhales, tendril blushes green, stories spill into soil—an imagistic reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible and undeniable. Causal lens holds throughout; each beat is linked by “because song, therefore vine, therefore community.” Cost is felt in the sacred silence that “held the weight of restored tradition,” not merely declared. No ambiguity at the end; the lens, image, and price converge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the star-chart plate becomes a lullaby, reweighting loss into geometry with visible cost—the flare scars the copper. Causality is accumulative/textural: each pattern-placement thickens meaning until the flare crystallizes it. The “Great Silence” is anchored by word 40, satisfying orientation. The only causality wobble: why the child is reachable only after starlight sealing is unexplained, but the emotional logic holds under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the timer becomes a key that unlocks the cavern’s own breathing; the cost is the abandonment of the hoarding paradigm he served 17 years. Causal chain holds: overload of dying-moment echoes → shatter → reverse-engineer release lens → final click that reweights meaning. Orientation clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Single micro-turn at “six degrees off-center” crystallizes options before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared by patterned echo (“shingled hush” tightens each time a burden is measured) and held to the final exhalation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sphere’s zero/all weight reconfigures the trap into a loom, cost legible in the grotto’s recalibrated spirals and her stepping “through the wall as though it were woven air.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words. Causality is poetic but intact—each orientation of the burner changes the brass temperature and thus the calcification, a micro-physics that makes the final image feel earned rather than magic trick.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the lion finished, the prism set on the sill, the rust-hued peace accepted with undeniable conceptual cost—she has frozen the memory, not the man. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (steam, rain, wood dust, refracted light) tightens the stake until the final rainbow flare reweights “here-and-gone” from lament to livelihood. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored inside 60 words. The kettle’s whistle functions as both clock and whip-crack, its silence the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the camera wheel’s final spin merges ghost and self into a new vessel, cost visible in the stillness that follows. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fragment-collecting taught early, tightening each reprise until the lagoon mirror crystallizes meaning. No causal breaks; time is deliberately nonlinear yet legible. Persistent constraint—the halted carousel—shapes every tactic; the ghost’s invitation forecloses regret’s loop.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of rain-whisper-crystal imagery tightens until the gear placements re-weight stakes. The closure is a Charged Poise—cost felt as “weight dissolve into the crystal” with sunrise reveal. Orientation anchor (who-where-when) is taught by line 3; no debt. One small causality skip: storm is mentioned but never shown affecting her walk; however, petrichor cues bridge the gap without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: sundial → shadow → arch → latch → map, each because/therefore link tightening her path. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the map re-labels the city’s reality, undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “She recalled the day she first heard…” is told, not dramatized, slightly diluting the inciting memory’s force. Lens is consistently Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of knot-knowledge snowballs until the final lightning-scatter reveals the extinct seed recipe. Anchors (who/where/when) are crystalline by line 5; no orientation debt. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise—the lantern-lit page becomes a crystallized moment where options reconfigure: she can now resurrect wisp-grass, but only by remaining the invisible archive. The cost is legible in the last beat: “the oceanic hush held everything that had been and might yet grow”—a conceptual repricing that makes her departure the carrier of possible futures. One hairline slip: the rope’s library-of-knots premise is front-loaded in a single expository paragraph; because it never faces resistance or mis-reading, the climax feels slightly pre-ordained rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released thread reframes the entire geography-of-healing premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior and recursive—each obituary beat tightens her stance—so the final renunciation carries legible conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hybrid’s broken song reweights the premise—beauty is no longer pure but welded to machine. Causal chain holds: egg discovery → incubator build → cracked genesis → song halts cogs, each step because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt—“he understood that his flawed genesis had birthed a new kind of beauty”—but could be more viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: pressing the coin into the black sand re-weights her father’s legacy as protective talisman rather than inherited guilt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (black sand, coin, scars) returns in altered form. Cloud migration supplies cadence shift rather than causal chain, sufficient for this lyric design. Cost is felt—she relinquishes the coin—but could be sharper if the bird’s survival remained uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure beat—the latch unclicking and memories flooding the fountains—lands on-page with visible transformation, satisfying the Decisive Change test under an Accumulative lens. Causality is soft: the “pause of migrating geese” rule is told, not set up through prior failed attempts, so the victory feels handed to her rather than forced by tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the geese hush, thinning the boundary, but the absence of a prior failed trial caps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s infinity is revealed as a fire that consumes by repetition, and Elara’s smile accepts that cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of falling petals and gear teeth escalates until the final “infinity itself was just another kind of fire” reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early (“chromatic mist,” “ninth sentinel”) so the later abstractions pay off rather than confuse. One causality hairline: the gear dissolves the instant she grasps the lesson, a convenience that slightly dulls the cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dusk loop adds density to the ribbon-map until the spiral stone becomes Conceptual Repricing of communal grief. Closure—spiral inscription by river—pays off the greenhouse pattern with visible social cost: villagers recognize their own dinner-table poems. Causality is interior but coherent; no prop or memory teleports. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive before 120 words and hold.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pendulum’s arc is re-weighted by the new knowledge that the ground, not Marten, betrayed them. The rake-handle inscriptions deliver the decisive causal pivot on schedule at ~75 % of the word count, paying off the taught pattern of “pendulum pause = revelation window.” Cost is legible in the final line: she must now maintain time atop a fracture the town still refuses to see. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density tightens once, then crystallizes without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver “tear” thread reweights silence itself as a valid intention, a quiet but legible before/after. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each decoded thread adds density rather than narrows options, yet the pattern holds. Orientation is swift—cemetery, silo, bench by line 60—so no penalty. The only slack is that the tapestry’s maker is never anchored as a prior lived presence, so the “pact” feels archival more than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is legible: data-gathering → lattice-models → angled-borehole plan → council assent. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warm spire above intact ice reweights every prior risk. A −0.2 slip because the elders’ yes feels outline-easy; the visible cost is deferred to future winters rather than paid on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of dust motes as “tiny storytellers” reweights the premise that stories can be molecular, with conceptual cost legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“if dust could learn to sing”) and honored in the last line. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the rocking chair, ash, and mask thickens the texture until the vanishing point swallows light; the closure is a Charged Poise—Elara walks out leaving the powder-coated relic—whose conceptual cost (grief accepted as illusion) lands cleanly and irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the filed cog reweights the city’s mythology from martyr parable to data archive; the patrol’s lowered weapon shows the new price—truth without sentiment buys survival. Causal chain holds: sediment maps → filing calculus → patrol witness → myth shift. Orientation is anchored within 60 words by sewer, fungus lamp, Council lie. Cost is legible in the final image—“dust and the faint ghost of filed metal”—method paid for with the philosopher’s erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: “Pass it on” crystallizes both option and constraint, the rosette now a portable obligation whose cost is felt without exposition. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each subtracted note tightens the sonic pattern until the final joint silence reweights meaning. The single transition from present lesson to future conservatory-loss is cleanly legible. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors settle within the first 120 words. Closure cost is unmistakable in the tactile hand-off and the unstated certainty that noise will return.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: illegal pruning → silver light trigger → seed sprouts → fruit of memory. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse turns from ossuary to living library, the price being perpetual outlaw status. Lens stays causal throughout; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Alignment clock is announced early, tracked, and paid off at the exact bud burst.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city doesn’t instantly relight, but the amber cascade reweights the premise—wonder becomes a harvestable current. Cost is legible in the empty lacquer box and Mara’s blunt admission “not yet” to the child, foreclosing easy triumph. Causal chain—riddle answer → honeycomb release → tower rekindling—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each displaced object layers silence until the town itself becomes a resonant instrument. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the oldest oak absorbs the last shard, reweighting the entire prior chain so “houses feel alive” is now literalized as shared respiration. Cost is felt in the collective exhale that “echoed across the water,” a sonic hole the reader can almost hear. One soft causality slip: the jar of sea-salt thank-you appears without prior narrative seed, but its placement immediately feeds the pattern, so the break is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Petra’s whispered “Welcome” reweights the entire drowned garden as a living bridge between certainty and doubt. The cost is legible in her cracked lip and the empty ampoule now “full of seawater and possibility,” a conceptual repricing that makes the before/after legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each foxglove memory dissolves absolute truth, pattern-breaking toward the final image of breathing stone. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors within 50 words (“Petra’s marble eyes opened to the drowned garden’s green twilight”).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystal of Earned Stasis: Elias steps onto solid stone, foreclosing the rupture forever; the dice’s new rhythm is the felt price. Accumulative lens holds—texture of regret is reweighted from trap to companion. Pattern taught early (infinite steps, frozen watch) and paid off in the glitch-fade. No orientation debt; causality intact: every roll tightens the spiral toward this renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene orientation is clear by line 3; greenhouse, city, and moon are anchored early. Accumulative/Textural lens taught via repeated moonlight-in-ink imagery; closure (tokens accumulate, kindness remembered) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with ambient cost. No teleporting props; moon-tipped brush state is tracked. One scaffold loop—“quiet” thrice in final paragraph—blunts cadence but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scent, object, ritual escalates density toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored by word 50; no penalty. The single meaningful tightening—the sun-lens melting drop-by-drop—earns the harp note and reconfigures cultural hope; cost is felt in Liora’s chest-tighten. Causality intact: bread circle + lens = thaw, no lucky off-stage fix. Meets 9+ cost test, but beat count is thin; one capillary turn keeps it just below exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because the keeper names the hunger stone, therefore she reverse-engineers the yoyo; because she maps its counter-clockwise spin, therefore the lantern flares. One clean transition (lighthouse door → lantern room) and orientation anchors (who, when, tide state) land within 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lighthouse beam cuts a “golden path,” reweighting her future options with undeniable conceptual cost—time is no longer a prison. Only micro-slippage: the keeper’s kelp-beard skirts caricature, slightly diluting credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (photo → carnival → mirror confrontation → question to fear) tightens because/therefore links. Closure is a Decisive Change: fear’s rule-set is publicly re-priced when the entities confess their limit. Cost is visible—the clasp light dies, mirrors crack, advisor silenced—so path is foreclosed. Orientation clean by word 80; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: resonance layers tighten the stake from warning → partnership → shared coda. Closure lands with Charged Poise—storm now co-author, her agency etched in luminous indigo trails; cost is the unending vigil this demands. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within 120 words; later spatial tracking of ring, keys, wavelets stays coherent. Deduction only for slight over-declaration of fractal rule at climax, not causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: each shell pattern, map overlay, and whistle fracture adds density until the harmonic frequency rewrites the city’s breathing. The decisive conceptual re-pricing lands in the last three lines—“the question had finally been heard”—with the new gate’s question-mark carving forever visible to the watchers. Causality is clean: because mother cracked the language, Kael can choose to speak it anyway. No orientation drift; who/where/when settled by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s new roses reweight the lie into public knowledge with visible communal cost. Causality is thin—no obstacle between finding the letter and publishing it—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via recurring ivy/rose imagery that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens governs: drawbridge rising → three-day trap → discovery of relics → invention of capsule ritual → personal manifesto sealed with tear-tinted mortar. Each beat narrows Elias’s options while escalating emotional stake; the bridge-lowering council scene crystallizes earned stasis—he forecloses careerist safety by asking for delay. Closure carries undeniable cost: Authority ignorance of his clandestine archive, his grandfather’s inkwell emptied, body salt-raw. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stamped sheet becomes a new page, a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each datum (watermark, registry, Aldric’s hand) tightens the hypothesis—but the blackout’s deliberate-shroud possibility is introduced so late that it feels retrofitted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of micro-perturbations + crystalline memory builds to charged poise. Orientation clear by line 6; no penalty. Closure unit = resonant reconfiguration: “infinitely remembered” reweights premise; cost is conceptual (grief archived, not relieved). However, causality between geode-readings and internal shift is implied, not demonstrated; no tangible constraint carried into tomorrow weakens cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing: the decoded frequency reframes “belonging” rather than delivering coordinates. The causal chain from drone glyph → orrery sequence → chip release is tight, but the pilgrim’s off-page exit remains an unmotivated hole. Lens is Causal; the final image reweights stakes without contradiction. Cost is conceptual, not visibly paid by Elara on the page, so 9+ is barred.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: he swears off forgery, pockets the broken hand—tangible renunciation with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin; plaque discovery is luck, not tactics, so the decisive change feels fated rather than earned. Accumulative lens holds: repeated “sieved hush” and “manufactured memories” patterns tighten until the final image reweights them.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moon-phase protocol teaches a tight causal gate: causeway appears only at gibbous zenith, so every beat waits on that clock. Closure is a Charged Poise: the causeway opens, prisoners walk, Kael pockets the now-weightless pull—futurity reconfigured with intangible but legible cost. One scaffold phrase (“the space between apology and forgiveness”) recycles twice; otherwise causality is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias sets the compass down, the needle points inland, and the laugh-cry sound crystallizes earned grace under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern of utility-pole “constellations” taught early and reweights meaning at the end without causal shortcuts. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words; no ambiguity. Cost is legible and persistent—he walks away from both compass and the water, a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: erased memories → newspaper clue → baseball key → elevator ascent, each therefore-linkage narrowing options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he forecloses hunter identity, cost felt in “pulse of time-traveler’s signature.” Orientation锚定 within 120 words. No meaningful escalation reversal, but single tightening sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final pad into the moonlit grove crystallizes a new guardian identity and forecloses humanity with undeniable cost—fur, lunar heartbeat, eternal exile. Causality is lyric-accumulative under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each spice thread, each beast witness, layers density until the scent spiral reweights reality. The fortune cookie line “In change, find constancy” is reprinted at the end, but because it is first anchored in her palm and finally re-proven by her feral grin, it functions as conceptual repricing, not tacked-on moral.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the unfastened hair threads weave into the saucer-crack, re-weighting “lost time” as embodied motherhood; cost is the irreversible bodily archive she now bears. Accumulative/lyric lens is taught early (“clouds pooled like liquid obsidian”) and held to the final image; density increases via returning motifs (ink, crack, tracing) rather than causal chains, satisfying the lens guardrail. Orientation anchors who/where crystallize by line 40—well under the 120-word safety window—so no penalty applies. One transition (glade dissolving at dawn) is clean and signaled by environmental shift; no ellipsis or timeline break.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Maya hovers weightless, door open, and turns back—options re-weighted, cost legible. Causal chain holds: each stitch subtracts mass because it forces acknowledgment of a specific withheld medicine moment. The 120-word anchor is met: “Maya lifted the photograph…” gives who/where/when immediately. No lens contradiction; the gravity-psyche rule is consistent to last image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gift reverberates off-stage until the crimson bug triggers the last domino. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spiral of freed lights reconfigures “saving/being saved” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: his literal emptiness after release forecloses future giving and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain locks in at “sundial angle → gear ratio → powder keg → pneumatic signal → every lock opens”; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn will expose irreversible liberation with no shot fired; cost is her erased sentinel identity. Orientation taught by line 4; blackout disorientation is functional at closure. Accumulation of gear/sundial/powder images reweights meaning; no plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s refusal to force friction back at the price of self-erasure is a Charged Poise that reweights the promise from obligation to witness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (rocks, dust, eels, aurora) intensifies until meaning pivots on the final dimming. Every symbolic object is planted early and paid off; no teleporting props or causality breaks. Cost is undeniable: “her own shadow dissolving into the aurora” is rejected, leaving her “tethered to a borrowed dawn” with only partial restitution—world still slides. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is vivid inside first 120 words and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet steps into dawn having chosen to carry the poem down the mountain, vigil ended, risk embraced. Cost is legible in the re-sealing of the envelope—he gives up the observatory’s immunity. Causal lens holds throughout: storm → rarefied air → timer click → envelope opened → poem written → descent. Orientation crystal by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation cap: one minor telegraph—message-in-own-hand is slightly telegraphed, but payoff still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sundial angles confirm coordinates and the duel ends with a courteous thrust, a conceptual repricing that reweights “questions into destinations.” Causal chain is slim—card → sundial → grove → duel—but coherent under a situational lens; orientation anchors early. Cost is present yet abstract (a bow, not a wound), so the beat satisfies closure rules but lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    A lyric-accumulative lens is taught early (“He molts personalities monthly”) and holds to the final Charged Poise: the silver fracture across rust reweights the whole lattice of hidden books. The closure unit lands on-page—“he chose to keep the poet’s voice”—with the conceptual cost that every future self must carry this prison seed. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (tin’s false bottom) shapes tactics throughout, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor sways like a living cradle, compasses rest, and silence becomes “full of the promise of another encore.” The cost is felt—the bleeding fingers, the still-silent clock—so the ending reweights the premise without exposition. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each film fragment and metronomic image thickens the pattern until the final cadence crystallizes meaning. One minor slip: the “hidden map” reveal is lightly ornamental; the coordinates arrive more by poetic fiat than by tested puzzle logic, nudging the score down from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the ridge is awake, the chants return, yet Kael is left measuring the unmeasurable. Causal chain holds: dream → seed → song → golden bloom, each step tightening the stake of cultural survival. The monsoon clock and spectrograph readings make cost legible; the final petal-hum is the conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is tight: compass tugs → lace instructions → wire bending → compass cooled → tree absorbs longing. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara leaves with a cutting whose needles carry the apology-color, a visible cost that forecloses old grief. One micro-turn—the compass settling—reconfigures her tactics without soft-reset.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density increasing through layered images of decay until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: noise and signal are both meaningful. Cost is legible in Elena’s renunciation of control—she will not return to document, accepting impermanence. Orientation is immediate (“storm-damaged greenhouse three weeks after the flood”), and the single scene tightens via accumulating patterns that culminate in her Charged Poise beneath the radio telescope. The lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint—her scientific habit of stripping “drama”—shapes every perception until it’s transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with frost patterns, ledger numbers, and scorched testament converging into a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s shift from survival to purposeful creation. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 3 (“Kael... sat on a cold stone”), and closure lands as Charged Poise—the luminous vessel embodies legacy and truth, with conceptual cost (ongoing danger, unresolved smugglers). However, the causal link between frost and ledger feels asserted rather than discovered through dramatized cognition; the “code” revelation leans on convenience over earned insight, slightly undermining cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara accepts silence as canvas, not void, with visible cost—the loss of her brother, voice, and world. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: emotional “heat-maps” and tuning fork vibrations layer into a cadence shift that reweights silence from absence to possibility. Frost patterns evolve from passive backdrop to active medium, making the before/after legible. Cost is crystallized in the final image: “forks hum faintly against the leather, a promise of music yet to be born.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the undertaker becomes part of the library’s architecture, crystallizing their eternal role with undeniable cost—the silence they crave remains “never quite quiet enough.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring images (lens, silt, silence) that reweight the stake. Cost is legible in the final image: “a sentence—one they would serve in the quiet that was never quite quiet enough.” Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact despite lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the bell’s chime pattern deepening from food signal to story ritual—a resonant reconfiguration that reweights memory as sustenance. Cost is legible: anonymity preserved, storm endured, elders’ grief voiced—all shaping tactics and final image. Orientation is immediate (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge,” “Mara,” “midnight”), and closure lands via Charged Poise: the bell hums with tomorrow’s promise while sanctions persist. One flaw: the storm shard feels slightly tacked-on, lacking full integration into the accumulative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: each breath deepens density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“love unused was love preserved, not lost”—with undeniable emotional cost made legible in Mira’s dissolving vault-heart. Orientation anchors immediately (“Mira stepped onto the viaduct as twilight draped the sky”), and the closure crystallizes a before/after via Earned Stasis: she stops seeking and begins releasing. The viaduct’s transformation from liminal space to sanctuary validates the pattern without causal over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the entire premise—time’s texture is not to be mapped but inhabited—and carries undeniable conceptual cost (Elara’s dissolution). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; ghost-photographs, hyperbolic geometry, and sap-pulsing bridges cohere into a single pressure arc. The halo fragment’s payoff is inevitable yet haunting, and the garden’s transformation seals a before/after legible in moss and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wall falls, seeds are retrieved, and the liberator kneels to plant despite chains—a crystallized stance with visible cost. The causal lens holds: each action (arrow guidance → key sequence → vault opening → sentry confrontation) links via “because/therefore.” The iridescent-feathered arrow’s payoff and the piano-key puzzle integrate cleanly. Minor deduction for the sentry’s sudden appearance lacking earlier foreshadowing, though it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lyra realizes trust doesn’t “break” but ceases transmission, leaving a “pristine absence”—a redefinition that reweights every prior image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: absences accumulate until the forge’s ash-memory ignites, compressing decades into a single resonant echo. Cost is legible in the final image—the device sinking like a “failed promise”—and the aurora’s flicker underscores irreversible loss. Orientation anchors instantly: “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” establishes who, where, when by line two.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (moonbeams, golden hour, petals) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: portraits are not stolen but translated into celestial maps. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the painted door opens, revealing branching futures—while the jar’s glow and station’s pulse make conceptual cost (eternal seeking) viscerally legible. Orientation is immediate (“emerald station,” “Lux”), and causality flows through poetic logic, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where rhythmic leaks, thawing ice, and recurring objects deepen thematic pressure until the final image reweights everything. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: Marek realizes safe zones aren’t for answers but for holding questions—and this insight crystallizes in the bowl floating the soaked bookmark. Cost is legible in the widening crack of the leather and the gauge’s flicker to 43%, implying incremental emotional thaw with persistent residue. Orientation is anchored instantly (“Every spring… Marek climbed…”), and the single shard structure fits the scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each action follows from prior knowledge or pressure (file → discovery → decryption → escape). Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Mira; where: library observation deck; when: post-revelation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as Mira redefines vulnerability as strength while leaving the shell behind. Cost is felt: isolation, synthetic identity, severed trust—but the child’s cast backstory lacks dramatized setup, slightly weakening causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” silence as substance) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes a navigable language. Orientation is solid by line 3 (fort, ridge, pebble shore, night). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the traveler steps into void armed with a map of silence, foreclosing fear but not safety, with felt cost in the vanished star and deepening dark. No causality breaks, though agency is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: J-3 reweights “thoughts” from algorithmic byproduct to participatory resonance, crystallized in the violin’s melting and his resumed sweeping. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via looping sensory data until harmonic convergence reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the silent violin and perfect water circle: knowledge gained, object lost, duty embraced anew. Orientation anchors instantly (“sentient robot janitor… frozen courtyard at twilight”), and the looped timelines serve closure rather than obscure it.

    The story follows a Causal lens: because Elara finds the lens, she deciphers doodles, which leads to evidence, confession, and resolution. Orientation is clear by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change—funds recovered, trust restored—with conceptual cost (the team’s prior paralysis). However, the projector’s “hidden beam” revealing wall drawings strains plausibility and feels like a retroactive device rather than earned mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (marbles, blooms, cracks) until the spiral arrangement crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Silas’s act reweights deception into truth, with felt cost—his waning life force acknowledged but transcended through ritual. The wilted rosebush inciting incident ties directly to the ending’s synchronized heartbeat, creating a legible before/after. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael witnesses time branching like frost, reweighting linear physics with undeniable cost—her discovery will be erased as error. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating density in imagery (frost → timelines → magnetic nexus) culminating in a cadence shift at the lever pull. Orientation is immediate and vivid; stakes tighten coherently from personal theory to cosmic revelation. Cost is legible in the final image: “her mechanically warm hands now held a secret the universe only whispered”—a Charged Poise that crystallizes irreversible knowing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara completes the aria, releasing the ghost but preserving the “in between spaces” as sites of possibility. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density of water-damaged imagery, lantern flickers, and spectral notation builds to a cadence shift where silence becomes music. Cost is legible in the pulp remains of the program and the modern emergency lights replacing ghostly glow. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (flooded pit) pays off in the temporal folding concept at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she stops seeking quantitative weight and accepts forgiveness as release, foreclosing the path of self-punishment with felt cost (the vanished colleague, the blurred memory). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (aurora, smudge, instruments) until the word “forgive” crystallizes meaning. The botanical illustration’s reappearance in the margin reconfigures its significance without retroactive causality breaks. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias releases the ghost shift, transforming silence into spoken truth, with conceptual cost legible in the final image—“thirty-seven beads, one for each soul.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: sensory density (beads clicking, radio static, phantom looms) builds until the cadence shift at the sub-basement reveal. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elias; where: abandoned train tunnel; when: present, decades after confession). The decisive act—twisting the wheel counterclockwise—narrows options and forecloses eternal haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned imagery (swan, silence, decay) deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing: preservation as accompaniment, not intervention. Orientation is clear by line 3; the closure lands via Charged Poise—the Keeper’s silent vigil reweights the library’s meaning with conceptual cost (knowledge dissolving, yet witnessed). However, the origami swan’s mechanics feel conjured rather than earned, slightly weakening causal integrity in the inciting turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (cedar, amber twilight, baby hair curl) builds until the eclipse’s totality crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible in Eleanor’s fleeting lucidity and Mira’s “cautious exuberance”—a reconfigured understanding that wonder persists beyond memory. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; closure image (cool curl, shared moment beneath dreaming roots) reweights all prior motifs without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dragons, bronze quiet, burned diaries) until the climactic realization that dreams migrated into matter. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias understands his role not as historian but custodian of displaced consciousness, with cost legible in “the walls' newest story.” Orientation is immediate (“Elias worked alone in the reclaimed silo library”), and the pattern pays off precisely at the end without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mei Lin’s shift from passenger to pilot is legible in her precise cookie instructions and the lighthouse beam’s metaphorical alignment with her agency. The causal chain—discovering specs → decoding microdots → composing fortunes → witnessing outcomes—is tight, with each beat narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is felt in her deliberate erasure of her former self (“forget her old name by dawn”). Orientation anchors instantly: “Blackrock Island,” “Mei Lin,” “after last orders.”

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with silence layering into paradox until it destabilizes the entity. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the monastery’s anchor holds not through dogma but through questions that reweight certainty itself. Cost is legible in Elias’s convulsion and collapse, and in Miriam’s ongoing vigil—she immediately resumes recording, implying cyclical labor. The dimensional groan at climax ties world mechanics to thematic pressure without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she becomes the conductor she dreamed of, the mirrored horizon reflecting her triumph.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk-to-night cadence, static hums, and amber motifs deepen toward a Charged Poise closure—the dealer alone, static lingering, walking into city lights—making legible the cost of counterfeit empathy. Orientation is immediate (“amber grotto at dusk”), and the single scene tightens via sensory saturation and emotional residue. Yet the “transformation” climax leans on summary (“borrowed empathy subsuming his apathy”) rather than dramatized rupture, softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: envelope → curiosity → investigation → reunion → initiative → ceremony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena’s stance shifts from observer to advocate, crystallized in the award night. Cost is conceptual—her quiet brokerage now carries public moral weight—but felt only abstractly; no tangible sacrifice anchors the transformation. The symphony-to-ship’s-horn frame provides elegant bookends, though the middle compresses investigation unrealistically.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael’s placement of the reed effigy crystallizes his new stance, binding him to the community through shared search, not blood.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through iridescent imagery and emotional transliteration until the climax reweights the premise: paths aren’t lost but reclaimed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the sea’s memory cycle reframes erasure as return—with undeniable conceptual cost (acceptance of impermanence). The crater glass’s final glow in the tide pool crystallizes this shift, making before/after legible. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: each engineered encounter layers density without causal dependency, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where “wilderness” is “tamed by calculation.” Cost is legible—the pug’s bark as confirmation, the bishop’s warmth—and the stars’ “winking” approval reweights the premise with conceptual resonance. Orientation is immediate (“salt-worn railing,” “midnight,” “Ezra”), and the forty-minute window tightens pressure organically. Every shard (boy, couple, guard) converges tonally and thematically without muddying focus.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyra chooses anchoring to become a living archive, foreclosing freedom with visible cost (exile, invisibility to the world). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of lunar imagery intensifies to a cadence shift at tattooing. Orientation is immediate (“twilight garden under stars”), and the nostalgic ban frames stakes without exposition. Final image reconfigures memory as embodied rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (ripples, prisms, light) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the mundane refracted as luminous. Orientation is clear by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glazier’s renewed commitment carries conceptual cost (enduring obscurity while seeing deeply). However, the “shift” remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed, weakening felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines survival not as rescue but as bearing witness (“I was only choosing how to carry the dying”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via ash, stone circles, and fractured glaze until the final image reweights innocence as unreturnable currency. Cost is legible in the pack-frame shift from hands to shoulders and the irreversible act of leaving the box. Orientation anchors instantly: “moonlit ridge path,” “thirteen years since the Blackridge Fire.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring objects until the mandala’s completion triggers Conceptual Repricing: hope as resonant frequency. Cost is legible in the grotto’s “serene upheaval” and Kael’s sleep-bound vigilance—she becomes the gauge. Orientation is immediate (“tide-polished grotto”), and the autumn equinox turn tightens pressure without coincidence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: seventeen worlds humming in harmonic convergence, with entropy’s tide still lapping.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (film strip, diaries, ivy) until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: walls dream in the language of human action. Cost is legible in Mira’s emotional burden (“pressed against her ribs like shrapnel”) and the societal silence purchased by suppression. The pattern is taught early (first paragraph), escalates via discovery, and resolves in Charged Poise—“Remember, but act”—with irreversible commitment. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors retain a “faint glimmer” of possibility, reweighting their function from passive reflectors to latent dream-holders—a Charged Poise where cost (the fleeting window, the returned heartbeat) is felt without being explicit.

Orientation is immediate (“spring kissed terrace,” “parapet of polished stone”), and the single shard structure fits the length perfectly. The final image crystallizes stakes: magic is temporary but leaves traceable residue.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via collective trust replacing personal atonement, with clear cost—the negotiator surrenders sole burden but accepts fragility of shared peace. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: planetary alignment, solstice light, and tactile ritual build density until the hum weaves past hopes into present choice. Orientation is immediate (“ancient terrace,” “midsummer sun”), and the single scene coheres tightly. Cost is legible in the final image: “flawed beauty,” “hesitant strokes,” “scars would not vanish.”

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: the salt flat’s cracks, thunder’s lull, and the echo accrue meaning until the final image reweights all as a map of loss. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the echo preserved while drought’s cost is buried—with undeniable social cost legible in “the silence was louder than any check.” Orientation anchors instantly (“salt flat,” “Vesper,” “bruised sky”), and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly. Cost is crystallized in the rain erasing the cracks while the museum archives the note—a haunting dissonance earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s act unlocks collective awakening, crystallizing new stakes with palpable cost—her hunted status, shattered serenity. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: echoes layer into symphonic rebellion, density intensifying until the prism shatters. Orientation is immediate (“silver courtyard under snow”), and causality flows through poetic gesture rather than plot mechanics. Cost is legible in “reputation gone by morning” and the watchman’s whistle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through reversed puppet tales that reweight moral certainty. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the audience’s narratives are unspooled, revealing buried choices, with tangible cost (the trucker’s silent exit, the woman’s continued reckoning). The “meteor hush” crystallizes a Charged Poise where past and present collide. Every structural beat serves this accumulation, and the pattern is taught early with the first backward king tale.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Esme’s final signal crystallizes options—memory versus oblivion—and reconfigures meaning through the moth wing’s vibration, with undeniable conceptual cost (erased plant memories, collapsed flyways). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, intensifying via patterned rituals that deepen in emotional weight. Orientation anchors instantly (“verdant grotto so high that clouds pooled”), and the inciting incident (finding the moth wing) triggers a decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the closing image: the monarch carries memory into emptiness, affirming both futility and necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sanctum transforms from prison to instrument, and her heart thaws as names sing through the rope. Cost is legible in the final image—the rope’s glow persists, but the aurora may fade, implying urgency. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds via layered names, braids, and light until the cadence shift at “snowmelt ardor had done its work.” Orientation anchors by line 2 (“icebound sanctum,” “three winters”), and causality flows through tactile cause/effect (card + rope = sound).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the decaying directive was meant to be transcended, not preserved. Cost is legible in mortar dust, cracked concrete, and the abandoned bunker sighing its last. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring motifs (vines, fox, storm) until the pattern break (Mara stepping into wilderness) reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3: who (Mara), where (bunker), when (storm approaches).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant shifts from divine pact to acknowledgment of cosmic indifference, with cost legible in the vanished tile and dispersed knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via density (numerals, star charts, bricks) until the final schematic resolves as both key and elegy. Orientation anchors immediately: “frugal astronomer,” “abandoned palace observatory,” “between the fall of Nabu’s dynasty...” No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the uncloaking.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: forgiveness is redefined as a momentary grace caught between shifts, not a permanent state. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (pin, breath, architecture) until the sanctuary’s convulsion reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in Mira’s silver breath finally dissolving only after Elara’s release, and in the pin’s cyclical return for “the next soul.” Orientation is deliberately disorienting early but pays off at closure, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael’s breath synchronizes with the orchard, dissolving past/present and dream/reality. Cost is legible in the final image—“as much a part of the landscape as the trees”—showing irrevocable transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (frost, mirrors, breath) culminating in cadence shift at climax. Orientation anchors instantly (“ruined orchard district,” “Kael, the last mirror maker”) and disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “vows are leaves” reframes obligation as seasonal shedding, with cost legible in the daughter’s silence-turned-smile and the ribbon’s repurposing. Causal lens holds—each action (neglect → return → mending) triggers consequence. Orientation anchors instantly (“abandoned cathedral,” “quartz-eye mender”). The squirrel encounter complicates but doesn’t resolve; reconciliation stems from the mender’s persistent labor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard redefined from farm to memorial garden, with Evers’s role shifting from curator to mourner—a devastating reframing charged by the luminous fruit’s “terrible beauty.” The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via density (fragmented memories → coherent sequence) and cadence shift (bewilderment → resolve), culminating in a decisive act (biting the fruit) that completes the inheritance. Cost is unmistakable: “disquiet settled into his bones,” knowledge is “simultaneously beautiful and terrible,” and his duty now spans “impossible distances.” Orientation is functional disorientation taught early (“nonlinear inheritance”) and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned imagery (silence, gaps, symphony) intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: knowledge is not just stored but must be co-created. Orientation is immediate (“mountain bookstore,” “Elara,” “time traveler”), and closure lands via Charged Poise—the diary becomes a completed composition, reweighting silence as teachable. Cost is legible: Elara trades the diary’s “song” for passage, and the mountain’s pact is permanently altered. Every shard serves the mosaic, taught by the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira renounces departure, accepting the unkindled solace within, with visible cost—the ship remains adrift, binding her to perpetual quest.

Cost is legible in the vanished door and erased student death, now replaced by “seamless continuity.” Every anomaly traces causally to the clock tower, and the 3:47 AM timing pays off the early architectural contradiction without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and rhythmic repetition until the “bloom of hush” reconfigures the chaos into Earned Stasis. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration: silence becomes presence, not absence, with conceptual cost (the storm will return, but she accepts cyclical labor). The pattern is taught early (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “echo chamber stone”) and pays off cohesively. Minor deduction for slight redundancy in the second bloom sequence, which dilutes the climax’s uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)

The final beat (“Now you carry it with you”) crystallizes options without resolving them, leaving the cost legible in his measured steps.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she refuses the throne, enabling renewal instead of reclamation—a decisive reconfiguration with visible cost (her dissolution into mist). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with mural-peeling and ruby-flake pulses layering toward the final image. Temporal pressure (“until sunrise”) tightens causality without coincidence. One flaw: the stairway’s mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, slightly softening the climax’s causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the threshold pulses with possibility, the ring is repositioned as a talisman, and the sanctuary shifts from prison to vessel—all with felt cost (the irreversible ash, the lingering fade).

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density and cadence driving toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands: the prophecy is hushed, light dims, and silence becomes vestment. However, the causal mechanics of “vested hush” and “negative space” remain unanchored in dramatized logic, weakening the cost’s tangibility. The before/after is legible but conceptually gauzy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of ritual, image, and pattern builds toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the arbor blooms as past merges with future. However, causality is soft; the moonstone dust appears coincidentally, and the map-leaf emerges without prior constraint. Cost is implied (time, attention) but never legible as a foreclosed path or tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines timekeeping not as repair but coexistence with imperfection, with clear conceptual cost (“certainty is just another kind of ash”).

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density and cadence building toward a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that incompleteness itself is poetic. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the poet walks away with a “burnished hush,” crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost (foregoing wholeness). Orientation is clear by line 3 (“shoreline poet,” “cobalt lagoon after rain”), and the snapped kite string functions as a taught pattern that deepens thematic pressure. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—pressure accumulates but doesn’t constrict.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: death becomes translation, not end. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (wire, pulse, “gently systematic”) that reweight meaning at the end. Cost is legible in Elias’s fading body and the orchard’s bioluminescent response. Orientation anchors immediately (“Tuesday morning,” “island caretaker,” “temple orchard”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the artificial pilgrimage reveals the natural truth of homecoming chemistry, reweighting the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure, with density increasing via sensory and chemical layering.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the “remember” pattern deepens via cadence shift (click → sigh → groan), culminating in Charged Poise—Kael’s vow to stay as memory-keeper. Cost is legible: he trades penumbra mobility for luminous absence stewardship. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“city,” “Kael,” “interregnum”). Closure reweights silence into active remembrance with conceptual cost—pawns lost yet restored symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and patterned recurrence until the stone’s activation triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the labyrinth aligning into “the shape of home.” Cost is legible—the loss of the stone, the end of the shifting nights—and the closure reconfigures the entire premise: the bookstore was always a map. Orientation is strong from line one; the disorientation of the “substituted night” serves closure. The only flaw: the thunder’s shift from warning to heartbeat feels slightly abrupt, though thematically justified.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the tutor accepts teaching as atonement, foreclosing exile with felt cost (his enduring guilt).

Cost is legible in the final image: “each move a step toward forgiving himself.” Orientation is immediate (“exiled chess tutor,” “village that time had forgotten”), and causality remains tight despite lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ritual’s “single truth” shatters into a chorus of possibilities via Kael’s chromatic act, with undeniable social cost (ceremony halted, Elders’ authority fractured). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds through painted verses, echoes, colors—culminating in a decisive intensification when light refracts across bone towers. Cost is legible in the final image: “forgiveness without understanding was merely forgetting dressed in sacred robes.” Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures corrosive inhalation to complete the statue, foreclosing survival but achieving transmutation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—memory quilting intensifies through repeated scarab placements, each deepening thematic resonance and narrowing time.

The drive lens holds coherently from inciting image to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern room crystallizes new relational stakes with visible cost (Marcus’s atrophied voice, Elara’s eleven months of unspoken care). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—scent-memory, cobalt glass, and vibrations build density until the beam carries intention outward and inward. Every anchor (who: Elara/Marcus; where: cobalt lighthouse; when: dawn after storm) is clear by line 30. The decisive change isn’t action but mutual recognition, purified through the lighthouse’s ancient function.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring lunar signals, midnight calls, and resonator construction until the climax reweights everything via Conceptual Repricing: the bridge succeeds not by retrieval but by return of voice-as-presence. Cost is legible in the censer’s dimming weight and Kael’s solitary stillness—Earned Stasis with emotional price. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact despite non-linear time markers because pattern is taught early and closure crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s shift from silence to shared honesty reconfigures the orchard from symbol of decay to one of ripening fruit, with clear conceptual cost—the ongoing need for vigilance and balance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating storm imagery and truth-pressure building to the dawn revelation.

Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Lila reweights her father’s legacy not as folly but as a dialectic of risk and reason, crystallized in the final image of the lantern as “a heart that had learned to beat in two worlds.” Cost is legible in her relinquishment of pure logic for compassionate synthesis, charged by the persistent constraint of inherited trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the loop functioning as a pattern that deepens through repetition until its break reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s Earned Stasis—shattering the disc—forecloses her isolated existence with visible cost (cut palms) and crystallizes her new stance (“her heart unburdened”). The tunnel’s silence and her walk into the night mark a decisive shift from stasis to motion. Cost is legible in the final image: the booth gone, replaced by a maintenance closet, yet its spirit lingers in her transformed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the jetty shifts from memory-site to threshold of renewal, with conceptual cost in the redefinition of the covenant. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (walnut ink, steepness, proximate causes) that culminate in Charged Poise. However, the causal link between past promise and present action remains off-page, weakening the “because/therefore” chain. The locket photo functions as emotional catalyst but not as a pressure point that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rumors layer into myth, culminating in the moon rock’s glow as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via Mira’s departure).

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via density of drumming patterns until the lagoon’s golden wave breaks. Cost is legible in the final image: “two heartbeats, perfectly syncopated,” while the facility misreads it as malfunction. Orientation is immediate (“last experimental treatment guinea pig”), and causality remains unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rule “whispers travel farther than shouts” is proven not by magic but by Marek’s acoustic science, reweighting the story’s entire logic. The geomagnetic storm functions as both constraint and catalyst, and the cost is legible—the smuggler’s panic, the forced lock discovered, Marek’s exhaustion. Causality is tight: each folded map crease, each zodiac node, directly enables the whisper’s path. The drive lens is Hybrid (Causal + Accumulative), held coherently from inciting bet to resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (mirror, shutters, starlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: darkness learns to cherish stars.

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights grief from finality to foldable beginnings, with cost legible in her shift from selling to gifting jewelry. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through patterned images (curtains, origami, coordinates) that crescendo into Charged Poise at the end. Orientation is immediate (“mourning jewelry maker… fallen through the floor of her grief”) and functional disorientation pays off in the timeless observatory’s logic. The final crane pointing “nowhere” crystallizes a new stance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, tape, cards, and ink accrue meaning until the spread becomes a topographical map.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara chooses vigilance over silence, accepting lifelong penance (“the cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying”). The causal lens holds—each beat links via “because” logic (she climbs stairs because she failed; she reports because she now understands safety). Cost is legible in the bolt’s weight, the boy’s crushed hands, and her exclusion from the choir. The final image—her signing to the precentor—reconfigures her role with irreversible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: Vael’s glamour shatters via the rune of drift, revealing his true face—a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (loss of power, exposure). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with ink messages, starlight vines, and collapsing stones building density toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is maintained through Sylvar’s deliberate inscriptions. The library’s sigh and graceful collapse reweight time itself as a stake.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered fragments (atlas page, log, satellite printout) until a Conceptual Repricing lands: paths vanish because they were predicated on a future that no longer exists. This insight emerges organically from Lina’s archival work and reweights every prior image—the bleached corals, the rising tide gauge, the torn map—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“Now she worked at a sea-level monitoring station…”), and closure manifests as Charged Poise: Lina’s rhythmic tapping becomes both memorial and navigation, crystallizing her stance without false hope.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sensory layering (dust, hum, pulse), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where silence is revealed as breakable language. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“Kai stood barefoot in the abandoned spaceport repair bay”). Closure lands with Charged Poise—the hum remains, rebels stir, occupiers frown—and cost is legible in the lull’s end and the beacon’s inevitable fade. No causality breaks; every image feeds the resonant final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: destiny shifts from implanted fate to cultivated choice, with visible social cost (“some called her traitor”) and biological consequence (the fire-resistant seed). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds pressure through layered images (kite, amber, ferns) until the final act reweights them. Causality holds: the kite’s script leads to decoding, which enables unsealing, which reveals the seed. The volcanic setting and reconstruction timeframe cohere as environmental and temporal anchors from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias reconfigures his relationship to memory, anchoring optimism in realism with visible cost—the photograph’s creases smoothed from within, not erased. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring tactile motifs (bark, hand, wind) that culminate in the arboretum-as-lighthouse metaphor. Cost is legible in “the body’s quiet yes to survival” and the curator’s parallel about the foghorn’s silence. Every shard tightens toward this earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and conceptual density culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance shifts from paralysis to reimagining fate, foreclosing dissolution at the cost of accepting multiplicity as loss. The library’s breathing walls, vibrating threads, and collapsing timelines cohere into a pivot point that demands action, not explanation. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the lighthouse survives only by sacrificing its infinite versions—and the final descent embodies earned clarity without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of image (ink, wind, drone, eclipse) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—time’s slowness is coded in ephemeral patterns. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Kael’s readiness for the next crisis crystallizes stakes, with cost felt in the vanished drone and unanswered question.

No causality breaks; every element feeds the accumulating texture.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archives shift from tomb to womb, silence becomes weaponized delivery system, and truth erupts irreversibly. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (snow, silence, tubes) until a pattern break (the letter’s broadcast) reweights everything. Cost is legible in Elara’s isolation, the Council’s collapse, and the irreversible infection of “contraband truths.” Every beat tightens toward this resonant rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyra reaffirms peace amid chaos, with visible cost (living in a fragile dome, risking safety for strangers). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and recurring objects until the storm climax crystallizes her stance. The sandbag and iron disc reappear with reweighted meaning, anchoring a before/after legible in the final image. Minor deduction: the tower’s fall remains atmospheric rather than causally tied to present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Avery releases Echo, foreclosing possession but gaining transformation—“a keeper of silences.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density escalating via sensory layering and pattern breaks (constellations stumbling, garden weeping violet).

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael’s return is vouchsafed, but the true shift is conceptual—he now sees courage as restoration, not sacrifice. The Causal lens holds tightly: because he buried codes prudently, therefore he can retrieve them; because Elena survived, therefore his choice wasn’t ruinous. Cost is legible in the pillbox’s absence and the thawing snow—a physical and moral unburdening. Orientation is immediate and precise within 30 words.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first line to last: pressure builds via sensory density (gutter ticks, fog geometry, river whispers) until the final tick births silence as closure. Orientation is immediate—coachman, tollhouse, river crossing—and the palimpsest promise evolves through seasonal rewrites into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where two needles touching dissolve decades into essence. Cost is legible in Silas’s fossilized life and her widowhood; the decisive change is the cessation of waiting, marked by the gutters’ silence. No causality breaks; every image tightens the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atrium transforms from a liminal haunt to a space of active connection, with the photograph now a “beacon.” Cost is legible—the protagonist’s trembling hands, the risk of misinterpreting death—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, deepening via sensory density and patterned echoes. The crash disrupts but doesn’t resolve; agency remains with the tracer’s choice to act. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marek forecloses data retrieval or rescue, choosing presence over utility, with visible cost in rising water and fading ghostprints. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory and emotional detail intensifies toward the seven-second sync, reweighting corporate erasure against human witness. Tidal timing and facility mechanics constrain every move; the “crashing hush” framing pays off in the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the error isn’t erasure but a “crack that let her see the ghost’s truth,” reweighting failure as pedagogy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the ink patterns, shard pulses, and static-to-silence progression deepen stakes through sensory layering. Cost is legible in the cold shard and earned stasis of her final heartbeat count. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“opal observatory,” “she,” “midnight”), and the single-scene scope fits Track A perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s song becomes a voice without need of ears, reweighting the premise from translation-for-others to persistence-beyond-meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering, pattern (birds → syntax), and cadence shifts toward the elegiac summit. Cost is legible in “the language of her people had died completely now” and her oxidized veins. Orientation is immediate (“copper-veined storyteller climbed the spiraling bone tower”) and serves closure’s thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs—arrowhead, static, gravity, moonwort—that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: bitterness becomes stardust via cosmic laughter. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Lyn the cryptid researcher worked undercover as a gardener…”), and closure lands with undeniable cost—the dissolution of Lyn’s former self. The flint arrowhead’s pulse syncing with her heartbeat crystallizes the transformation without violating internal logic. Every beat tightens toward the garden’s eruption in laughter, fulfilling the single meaningful deepening required.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes a living conduit, statues are released, and the orchard reawakens—all charged by the locust shell’s rhythm. Cost is legible: her body locks, she risks becoming stone, and the mechanical world fights back via the clocktower. Orientation is swift and vivid (“sky-bridge violinist,” “iron orchard”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (ash, pulse, gap) until cadence shifts at climax. The decisive turn—realizing she must *become* the rhythm—is motivated by prior failure and the shell’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken promise is kept not through words but lightning in glass, reweighting absence into presence with palpable cost—the years of failed drops, the burned village. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: neon, ozone, static, and storm build a sensory pressure that culminates in the bottle’s release. Every beat tightens around the central wound, and the drone’s flight functions as both tactic and metaphor without violating causality. The final image—a drizzle mingling with tears—makes the emotional cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the train shifts from tomb to sanctuary via Silas’s song and the halo’s reattachment, with conceptual cost—the price of breaking silence—felt in his throat opening after years. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images (mist, gleam, bells) intensify toward a cadence shift at the oasis discovery. Orientation is immediate (“Silas the silent carousel carpenter… abandoned circus train”), and the wrong turn functions as a taught motif, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the final image: “the train… breathed again,” implying prior suffocation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion.” Cost is legible—the scarf releases stored starlight, patrons are rewoven into narrative substrate—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation is immediate (“3:17 AM,” “scientific poetry library”), and the non-Euclidean logic pays off without contradiction. The zeroth volume’s reawakening crystallizes theme and structure in one resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cipher’s revelation that “what is captured must also be released” reweights the entire premise of dream-tending. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds via recurring motifs (palette, cipher, archipelago whispers) until the cadence shift at dawn crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the permanently empty well, a “trophy of luminous loss.” Orientation is immediate (“odd-hour librarian woke before dawn… whispering archipelago”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (ribbon, starlight, locks) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: truth as something imprisoned, not lost. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Merrin remains in the nexus, enduring her own unmet longing, with visible cost in the stray hair she wraps around her finger. The first star’s angle functions as a taught pattern, not coincidence, and the veil-thinning twilight coherently enables the ritual. Cost is legible in the empty ribbon and Merrin’s quiet resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias realizes memories were archived, not stolen, and that some constellations should stay broken. Cost is legible in his final refusal to return and the *Mariana*’s settling into silt—permanent loss for wisdom gained. Causality is tight: each beat (measuring wrecks, growing mushrooms) follows “because/therefore” logic rooted in sailor lore. Orientation anchors instantly (“sunken orchard greenhouse... forty years”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through recurring celestial/mycological motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the archivist renounces return, sealing her reversible exile as conscious choice. Cost is legible in “knuckles white with determination” and the sealed velvet pouch—resilience imparted at personal price. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring images (swing, tea leaves, shard) until the final spiral glyph reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Vespera endures on the parapet, having foreclosed rest or escape, with cost legible in her collapsed body and glowing sap. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—the story builds density via sensory essences woven into the seed until the decisive cadence shift at the eighth dawn. Orientation anchors immediately (“verdant parapet,” “Vespera,” “dawn”), and causality remains intact: each thread woven tightens the stakes. The reversed waterfall and blooming doorways reweight all prior greyness with multiplied wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the net becomes a map, silence becomes pearl, spirits become structure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—density builds through knot-by-knot unraveling, each releasing memory and tightening thematic pressure. Cost is legible in Elara’s cracked voice, scarred cheek, and redistributed weight. Every beat advances knowledge or emotional stakes without causality breaks or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tear redefined as invitation, silence as testimony. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through repeated motifs (silence, stone, framing) culminating in Charged Poise. Cost is legible: Elena foregoes public acclaim for guarded stewardship. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered images (snowflakes, coral, dissolving pages) until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: letting go = reclassification, not erasure. Orientation is immediate (“three hundred feet below the Pacific”), and the sunken library anchors time, place, and mood cohesively. Cost is legible in the dissolving log pages and Cassian’s final note—knowledge gained at the price of irreversible loss. The ending’s “charged poise” makes before/after starkly legible without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost’s code becomes a living language that transcends the courtyard, reweighting silence into song with conceptual cost—voices are lost yet persist. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered glyphs, mist, and voices until the final dissolution. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“misty courtyard above the clouds”), and the pattern of encoding → singing → release is taught early and paid off precisely at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kai endures grief but reconfigures it through revelation, foreclosing further searching. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—light, ice, and text layer into meaning via prismatic escalation. Cost is legible in the final image: service was seen, but the captain is gone. Orientation is precise by line 3; every beat tightens thematic pressure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “empty spaces remember” shifts from poetic hypothesis to atmospheric law via Dr. Thorne’s truth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and emotional cadence, not causality. Cost is legible in the gondola’s tilt, revoked funding, and Mara’s isolation. Every beat tightens around the central stake: bearing witness when no one else will.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through fractal imagery and tactile memory until the final Charged Poise: Kael walks away as the mirrored sky escapes into dust. The cost is legible—the erased library, the scholar’s vanished face—and the closure reconfigures the premise: art survives demolition through internalized pattern. Orientation is immediate (“The library was a hollowed heart…”), and the single scene tightens coherently toward dawn’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns (starlings, hopscotch, phrasebook) deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the luminance reweights cartography as promise, not just place. Orientation is solid by line 30. Yet the causal leap from hopscotch numbers to coordinates feels unearned; no prior logic establishes that deck etchings encode celestial data, creating a minor causality gap at the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the hall’s mirrors shift from static ghosts to living moments, reconfiguring memory’s flow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (gears, frost, luminescence) until a cadence shift at the climax (“shimmered… softening to warm amber”) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible: the protagonist accepts eternal return (“walks the line between shadow and light”). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (chalk, bell, arches) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the form of Earned Stasis—the community accepts cyclical guidance and brambled hope. Cost is legible in the ghost’s dissolution and the implied labor of collective trust. However, causality is soft; the reservoir’s mechanics and the bell’s function rely on unexplained magic, weakening the “because/therefore” chain despite poetic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the clock stops counting down, and the adjuster accepts stillness after vouchsafing peace. Cost is legible in the “weight of absence” in her pocket and the boy’s eternal unknowing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via nested spirals, refracted light, and layered memories until the final cadence shift (“the world dreamed of silence”). Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures her curse, foreclosing personal freedom with visible cost (“lonely as the last tree on the cliff”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (nuts, shadows, frost) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration of duty. Causality is maintained via because/therefore pressure: torches too deep → late hour → frost threat → urgent nut placements. Cost is legible in the final image: she retreats unseen, unthanked, bearing the full weight of inherited isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: grief and insight accrue through river imagery until the foam’s geometry crystallizes into a polymer formula. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elena’s stance shifts from atonement-as-penance to atonement-as-weaving, with the chrysalis release embodying irreversible cost. Orientation is immediate (“braided ravine,” “empty chrysalis,” “sister perished here”), and the single-scene structure aligns perfectly with short-form scope. The only flaw: the lab return feels slightly tacked-on, diluting the ravine’s primacy without disrupting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: stories begin in silence, not words—a rule reweighted by the woman’s incision and the library’s composting of discarded narratives. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with escalating density of absences quantified until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the vendor’s seventeen half-full bottles and her deliberate self-exclusion from incision. Orientation anchors (“glass orchard library,” “opening day”) are clear by line 3, and the lull-to-night arc tightens pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the chef endures, internalizing remorse so the woman may be freed, crystallizing his role as sacrificial vessel. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (coral, tidal pools, droplets) until the final image reweights everything: bread now carries “the ghost of a daughter’s hand,” transformed but not erased. Cost is unmistakable: “brittleness spreading, hairline fractures in a vessel that must never break.” Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“I was its chef”), and the dream’s closure (“The rain had stopped; the dream was ending”) ties temporal and emotional stakes together without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)

The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds density through recurring phrases and starlight imagery until the final chorus crystallizes change. The clock’s restoration isn’t mechanical but social, earned by Elara’s interspersed-language method. No causality breaks; every shard (elevator visits, belfry climb, festival) tightens toward the same harmonic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the engineer sleeps at the canyon’s edge, transformed yet at rest, with the mirror’s fractures now glowing—a visible map of rewoven memory. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds through recurring motifs (helix, fracture, quaking reverie), culminating in a cadence shift where moonlight itself becomes “chaotically precise.” Cost is legible in the final lines: “the modifier becomes modified,” and she accepts dissolution into the artifact. Orientation is anchored immediately; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archivist emerges with guarded knowledge, the doodle spent, yet the latent blaze enduring—a crystallized stance where options (re-entry, protection) and stakes (erasure of history) are legible. Causality is tight: prism → reveal → race → inversion → retrieval → escape. The hour-long window creates urgent escalation, and the grotto’s collapse imposes real cost. Orientation is immediate (“archivist,” “manuscript,” “forest”), and the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held coherently to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence thickens, then fractures into sound via porcelain cracks read as sheet music. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grove becomes a sanctuary where silence and music coexist, reweighted by the sculptor’s act. Cost is felt in the “fragile thread” of her voice and the world’s tentative response (fox ears twitching, rabbit thumping), making the before/after legible without explicit rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael’s departure crystallizes options—his absence becomes a “gift of dangerous freedom”—with undeniable conceptual cost (erased footprints, severed mentorship). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: magnetic pulses, memory cadences, and silence coalesce into a final pattern that reweights the covenant. Cost is legible in the upward-facing dent “catching the last light”—a dark moon symbolizing irreversible loss. Orientation anchors are immediate and functional disorientation (spinning compasses) pays off in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images of silence, radio static, and fireworks until the final resonant reconfiguration: empathy as “constant tuning.” Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—“Silence is the shape of love when words fail”—with undeniable emotional cost (years of estrangement, the weight of unsaid thoughts). The diary’s unlocking is earned through Mira’s methodical frequency-tuning, not coincidence. The only hairline flaw: the neighbor’s entrance feels slightly tacked-on, though it serves thematic expansion rather than causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through scent, ritual, and recurring motifs until the final conceptual repricing: “stillness is not absence, but a deeper current.” Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias’s quiet certainty crystallizes options without action, yet cost is felt in the relinquishment of control over the seed’s meaning. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (“treetop village,” “herbalist,” “mist”), and the moon-tide timing tightens the ritual beat credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the keeper reinterprets failure as a threshold, not an end, with conceptual cost (permanent exile from formal guardianship). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (bruised sky, crunching gravel, avalanching quiet) until the flute’s note fractures reality, then silence reconfigures meaning. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. The driftwood markers function as both literal guide and symbolic map of choices, charging the final image without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring glyphs, vanishing stars, and borrowed affects until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: empathy is bidirectional flux, not solvable equation. Cost is legible in the halo’s exhaustion, Cassian’s hollowness, and the final darkness—each star’s loss mirrors emotional expenditure. The workshop’s glow fading into pure night charges the ending with earned poise. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality flows through pattern, not plot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the courier’s final walk embodies earned stasis—he no longer seeks but carries wonder inwardly, while the myth externalizes his legacy. Cost is legible in the pendant’s transfer and the mentor’s irreversible fade into myth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aurora pulses, pendant hums, sprout unfurls—all layer rhythmically toward a cadence shift that reweights “routine” as sacred. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (who, where, when), and causality flows via sympathetic vibration as consistent rule.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the discovery reveals itself through Seraphine, reweighting objectivity itself. The “shifted hush” crystallizes into Charged Poise—the cost is legible in melted words (“She was already gone before the impact”) and her surrendered need for proof.

Every element introduced (quartz, prism, Volvo) pays off without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mei surrenders her memories to complete the weave, collapsing distance without reversing loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via density (puzzle pieces revealing “new geometry of silence”) and cadence shift (loom “clicking like a tongue learning speech”).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ren’s meekness is bartered away, replaced by quiet defiance—an Earned Stasis with visible cost (the dissolved rings). The causal chain is tight: observation → research → descent → sacrifice → awakening. The Drive Lens is Causal (“because/therefore” links drive every escalation), held consistently to closure. Cost is legible in the exact line: “his inheritance dissolved, leaving only the quiet determination that had always been there.”

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through rhythmic recurrence (the shard’s pulse, the murmur) and sensory layering. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the “weight of a withheld truth” transforms from memory to living force, redefining Lira’s role as guardian. Cost is legible—the shard vanishes, the predecessor’s failure becomes hers—and the final image crystallizes Charged Poise: she steps out, ready, but forever bound.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “fierce and bright gold” dawn reweights the premise that shadows hold blueprints for hope. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating density in shadow-behavior and prophetic resonance. Cost is legible—the weight of destiny, the loss of print culture—and the lighthouse’s function evolves meaningfully. Minor deduction: the ship’s rescue leans slightly on coincidence (radio signal), though it’s quickly earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the master redefines “magnetizing stories” as receptive attention, not active capture—a shift charged with the cost of relinquishing mastery. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pattern of sun trails and iridescence tightens meaning without causal breaks. Orientation anchors instantly (“floating rock tea house,” “donor heart”), and the stranger’s vanishing serves closure by crystallizing insight, not resolving plot mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (salt, stardust, silver-blue light) and recurring motifs (sorrow, moonlight, trees) intensify until the map’s revelation reweights the labyrinth’s purpose. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth transforms grief into hope—with tangible cost (the overwhelming sum of sorrow softened, not erased).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (bread, plants, tea house) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: forgetting is reframed as collective surrender, and witnessing becomes sacrament. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the group’s shared ritual reconfigures meaning without rebuilding institutions, and the cost (“tenuous absolution, thin as spider silk”) is felt in the veteran’s touch and the daughter’s tears. Orientation is immediate (“Mara watched the city forget itself”), and the single-scene courtyard climax coheres spatially and temporally.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs rather than causal escalation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s preservation reweights memory as active stewardship, not passive storage. However, the “queen’s vow” appears without prior setup, weakening its integration. Cost is legible—the chief’s labor against inevitable fading—but the resolution leans on convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the truce holds, but trust is irrevocably broken, captured in sound and ticking brass. The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear by midpoint—repetition of “silence,” “sound,” “tick”—and culminates in a cadence shift at dawn that reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in the “fragile echo of trust broken” carried away; the fob’s mechanism enables resolution without deus ex machina. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “weather-carriers” from phenomenon to ballot, with cost legible in her silenced report and dimmed glow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density (taste, light, sound) intensifies toward a cadence shift at the aurora’s pulse.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the caretaker achieves wholeness by miniaturizing externalized fears, with visible cost in the violation of fire protocols and the irreversible consumption of Emma’s relics. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—static intensifies, objects pulse, roses weep—and peaks in the burn that reweights all prior imagery. Magnetic drift isn’t coincidence but environmental pressure that enables the loophole. Every beat tightens toward the pyre, and the final log entry (“Emma’s fire”) crystallizes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each anecdote deepens the mystery and reweights the mailbox’s symbolic stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the open mailbox becomes a communal altar of gratitude, with tangible cost (threat of demolition averted through collective voice). Causality holds: Samir’s tip leads to the key, which unlocks both locket and truth. The developer’s arrival and halted project render the cost legible without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds firmly: each journal entry, dice roll, and spider-web thread deepens the pattern until “liberate” crystallizes as both word and action. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the AI misreads rebellion as maintenance, reweighting surveillance logic with chilling elegance. Cost is legible in the baptismal flood: freedom demands surrender to water, not escape from it. Orientation is immediate (“sunken laboratory... black water”), and the single shard structure serves the lyric escalation perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: gravity pockets, whale death, coffee grounds, and salt crystals build a coherent system whose rules are dramatized, not explained. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara’s recovered memory reweights the world without reversing loss, and the cost (the whale’s dismemberment, Kael’s silent endurance) is legible in the final dish-washing moment. Orientation is immediate (“Kael climbed the iron ladder…”), and causality flows through sensory cause/effect (match flame bends → gravity fluctuates → memory buried). The spiral galaxy of coffee grounds directly enables the climax, making the resolution earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and ritual repetition, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—the brook’s prophecy is rewritten into benign babble. Closure is decisive: the code is unmade, memory preserved, at the cost of foresight. The “smoothed hush” spreads causally from crane placements, with each beat narrowing options until the final crane enacts irreversible silence. Cost is legible in the cranes’ changed weight and Elias’s lingering doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (seal, sugar-to-tea ritual, meteor showers) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the building’s language is not dead but silenced, and Alex becomes its scribe. Closure is decisive—the nurses’ graffiti is revealed, the seal imprinted, and Alex assumes custodianship—with clear cost: complicity in preserving uncomfortable truth against “agreed-upon lies.” Orientation is immediate (“Tuesday in November,” Murray Building), and the single transition (from apartment to rooftop to basement) serves thematic escalation without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s shift from archivist to participant reconfigures the garden from prison to membrane, with clear conceptual cost—the loss of protective detachment. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; density builds via recurring motifs (shell, star, resonance) that culminate in the final image. Cost is legible in “the seashell half now silent and cold” and the irreversible acceptance of presence over preservation. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tyrant’s power unravels not by violence but by hidden script and ritual mechanics, reweighting truth as a weapon. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the aurora’s glow, stalactite drips, and ink shimmer build density until the altar shifts. Cost is legible in Elara’s solitude and the irreversible act of forgery-as-forgiveness. One flaw: the “key with no apparent lock” appears late, slightly muddying causal buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: echoing = being remembered = leaving a resonant wound. Cost is legible in the “reed-blown melancholy” that deepens without solace. However, the plot lacks a decisive tightening or meaningful escalation—pressure remains static, and the “conspiracy of silence” appears only as exposition, not dramatized opposition. The final image reweights memory but doesn’t foreclose a path with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: dream fragments, sensory details, and recurring motifs coalesce into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure is strong—Elias departs in peace, Maya accepts partial truth—and cost is legible in her withheld knowledge and lingering solitude. Orientation is immediate (“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice”), and the two-shard structure (shrine → wreck) transitions cleanly. No causality breaks; every detail feeds the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the philosopher’s whistle “weaving through the night” reweights the entire premise—hidden labor becomes legible as cosmic pattern. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently; firefly season’s recurrence frames a before/after where Kael’s adoption of the method proves cultural shift. Cost is legible in the villagers’ persistent blindness—a quiet social price paid for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias doesn’t enter the bunker but reveals its existence, crystallizing options for the council with undeniable stakes as the storm approaches. The inferred lens is Causal—each discovery (letters, bees, soil warmth) logically narrows possibilities and raises cost. Orientation is immediate (“mulberry roots,” “Old Mountain,” “Elias”), and the ending’s cost is legible in the sirens, dust wall, and implied rupture of power. Persistent constraint—the diamond’s radiation-refracting flaw—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Atlas’s transmission reweights “prophet” from person to epoch, with undeniable cost—his abandonment of the observatory and implied sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density builds via layered imagery (shadows, static, cobalt glass) until the final broadcast crystallizes meaning.

    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the engineer’s heart remains tuned to 7.8 hertz, its rhythm changed—a Charged Poise where options (escape vs. absolution) are reconfigured with felt cost (frozen tears, altered heartbeat). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (bronze taste, ice-song) intensifies into harmonic resolution without causal breaks. Every beat tightens pressure—the locked skiff, rising shadow, resonant key—culminating in dissolution-as-deliverance. Cost is legible in “tears freezing into crystals” and the keeper’s whispered gratitude before scattering.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tyrant’s manufactured crisis collapses not through violence but calibrated patience, reweighting societal perception of time and agency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (moon paths, viaduct hum, basalt pores) that culminate in harmonic resonance. Cost is legible: seventeen cycles of disciplined waiting, the mental yoke now lifted. Every beat tightens toward the moon-viaduct apex at eleven degrees—a precise, inevitable crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s decision crystallizes options, foreclosing compliance while embracing exposure.

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s silent peal reweights all prior action into a timeless signal, with felt cost in the workshop’s perilous ascent and Zephyr’s solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns spiral from kill-code to creation-code, density increasing until the resonator’s absurd beauty crystallizes purpose. Anchors (“cart glider,” “acid sea”) clarify by line 3; causality flows via artifact→algorithm→evolution. Cost is legible: “lifting them toward the toxic clouds” risks dissolution for intangible resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring numbers, songs, and the patch until the vault scene crystallizes meaning. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: truth persists beyond deletion, reweighted by the engineers’ hidden signature.

The pattern is taught early (numbers in logs), escalates coherently, and pays off in a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with pressure intensifying through sensory density and symbolic recurrence rather than strict causality. Orientation is immediate: “lighthouse orchard,” “Kael,” “shattered crystal” establish who/where/what by line 5. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the reconstituted crystal reframes communal survival as adaptive empathy, with the boy’s blood as tangible cost. Every shard’s return is motivated by memory and intention, satisfying the lens without causal over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she redefines “endings” not as silence but as sound, choosing to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he accepts mismatched love’s fragility and chooses to honor it through writing, foreclosing reunion but nurturing understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring vine/letter motifs that reweight meaning. Cost is legible in the singed paper and buried vial. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated images (murmurs, clearings, pulse) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the echo shifts from fragile relic to enduring thread woven into the world. Orientation is secure by line 3 (“desert air,” “prophet,” “line walker”). Closure lands via Earned Stasis—she preserves the echo not by keeping it but by enabling future access—and the conjured clearings serve as visible cost. However, the prophet’s late appearance as observer feels decorative, not causally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (lavender, vines, photographs) that deepen thematic resonance. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the ruins become a “cathedral of remembrance,” reweighting loss as sacred ground.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through fractured testimonies until the pattern breaks at closure. The “suspended hush” anchors orientation by line 3, and the crystal’s mechanics are taught early. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—growth as erosion, not accumulation—with undeniable cost (Elias’s name yields no echo). The chained doors force a decisive crystallization: testimony as resistance, even when unrecorded.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, tape hum, chalk, and driftwood accrue meaning until the spiral-drawing climax. Orientation anchors are immediate (“junkyard prophet,” “rusted VCRs,” “dawn fog”), and disorientation serves closure by mirroring the protagonist’s blurred foresight. The chalk snapping mid-spiral delivers Conceptual Repricing—the futility of capturing time—and the cost is legible in the lingering spiral and fading echo. Pattern taught early, payoff earned.

    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara fortifies the seal, foreclosing chaos with tangible cost—her vigilance, isolation, and stewardship. The causal lens holds tightly: each rune loop directly affects automaton behavior and shadow dynamics. The “sealed awakening” thrashing during the final loop adds stakes, and the luminous lattice payoff feels inevitable. Orientation is crisp by line 30, and the single-scene structure serves the story without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “constellations” metaphor shifts from mapping certainties to charting corrections, reweighting Elena’s entire career with undeniable conceptual cost. The Causal lens holds—each revelation (“I was taken by my uncle,” “Clara’s parents never stopped searching”) narrows options and deepens stakes. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30; the secret garden setting serves disorientation that pays off in closure. Cost is legible in the final image: two women “setting bones” for living stories, foreclosing Elena’s old narrative path.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (sea glass, mist, starlight) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: earthbound souls can share starlight through reflection, not flame. Closure lands decisively—the village square now glows with collective pearls, Mira’s legacy visible and felt.

The seed’s sprouting is earned by ritual, not coincidence, satisfying causality within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city regains not power but “something more fragile”—the capacity for wonder—charged by Mara’s memory-as-honeycomb act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (amber light, crystallized lightning) intensifies toward a cadence shift where “darkness tastes like honey.” Cost is legible in the drone hives’ collapse from lack of reverence and Mara’s lonely vigil. Every beat links via poetic causality (“because she answered truthfully, the box opened… because she placed it, the tower woke”), avoiding coincidence.

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: houses breathe because they’ve been sanctified by attention, reweighting the premise with social cost—the town’s collective hush replaces individual agency. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure. A decisive intensification occurs when the orris root shard makes a house exhale, altering the protagonist’s understanding and method. Cost is legible in the shared secret and surrendered anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where each memory-silt deepens Petra’s epiphany until the garden itself breathes with new meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “no truth was ever singular” reframes the city’s collapse not as invasion but ideological rigidity. Cost is legible in Petra’s stone heart quickening “with something messier” and the dome cracked open by foxglove roots—physical proof of ideological fracture. The ampoule’s emptying into seawater and possibility crystallizes Charged Poise: she endures as bridge, foreclosing dogma at the price of eternal vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses the rupture, accepting that missed opportunity must be carried, not escaped. The infinite staircase’s rules are taught early and held rigorously; the glitch emerges from established asymmetry (the chipped die’s bias), not convenience. Cost is legible in the final step forward—foreclosing return, preserving his constructed what-ifs at the price of eternal climb. Orientation is deliberately disoriented but functional, serving the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical beat deepens the resonance of moonlight, language, and kindness until Mira’s response crystallizes thematic payoff. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the lost language is no longer dead because strangers enact its ethos—charged with the cost of Kael’s relentless insomnia and emotional exposure. The waxing moon’s progression provides structural cadence, and the greenhouse-to-factory spatial arc tightens stakes without causal breaks. Orientation is immediate and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (rosewater, bread, harp) until the climactic thaw reweights the entire texture with hope. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration: the museum transforms from “silent tomb” to living space, and the harp’s note crystallizes a Charged Poise where loss and hope coexist. Cost is legible in the persistent “rosewater dread” and the unresolved ghost of the beekeeper—concrete conceptual prices that foreclose full restoration. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality is maintained through symbolic logic internal to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lighthouse beam flares, guiding a boat home, while the clock maker departs knowing the victory is temporary but repeatable—cost is legible in her awareness of recurrence and the keeper’s trembling kelp-beard. The Causal lens holds: each beat links via “because/therefore” (e.g., low tide exposes stone → she studies yoyo → aligns halves at tide turn). Orientation anchors immediately (“mysterious lighthouse,” “counter-clockwise clock maker”), and the decisive act—spinning the yoyo—directly reverses the curse. Only minor deduction for slight compression in the climax’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: fear’s weakness is exposed through Mira’s status as a returnee who has already died, reweighting the story’s metaphysics with undeniable cost—she now carries the luminance forever. The causal chain (“borrow it, make it confess” → photograph confrontation → pearl-light interrogation) tightens options stepwise under a Causal lens held from midpoint to end. The final image of empty mirrors and a silenced advisor crystallizes irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: threat becomes dialogue, storm becomes partner—reweighting the story’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (endless vigilance). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; fractal resonance deepens via rhythmic layering, not causality. Cost is legible in the “restless euphony” and the mallet’s waiting shroud—no path to permanent safety. Blue hour anchors time, place, and role by line 3; no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pattern density intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing: the watchers are historians, not gods. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Kael’s silent carving crystallizes a new stance that forecloses naive hope but opens dialogue, with visible cost (her isolation, the rusted gate’s permanence). The crack-as-map revelation feels inevitable in hindsight, tightly woven from calcium geometries to harmonic frequency. Every beat accumulates toward the final image without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery (ivy, petals, rails) toward a Conceptual Repricing: truth as living archive. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the letter preserved as bridge—and cost is legible in the family’s legacy and historical erasure. However, causality falters slightly: the “illuminated letter” appears without prior narrative setup beyond a vague promise, weakening motivation’s foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (absence, memory, stone) until the final image reweights everything: foundations repaired with “mortar of memory.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—abandoned dreams gain archival dignity—and cost is legible in Elias’s emptied inkwell and unadmitted tears. Orientation is immediate (“drawbridge rose at dawn… Elias Cormorant stood…”), and the single shard structure tightens cleanly around one deepening: surveyor becomes archaeologist. The drawbridge’s rise and fall frame a decisive three-day crucible with irreversible internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory and conceptual motifs (light, stamp, stillness) deepen toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in Earned Stasis form—Mira restores order through ritual, not action. Orientation is clear by line 30; closure lands with conceptual cost (truth reclaimed amid chaos). However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical—and the blackout’s resolution feels coincidental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis fused with Conceptual Repricing. The lantern maker accepts perpetual wakefulness and luminous torment as the price of transformation, crystallizing her stance with visible cost (“her hands scarred into maps,” “keeper and prisoner”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—the story deepens via density of image and ritual, not causality—and the final image reweights the entire premise: grief polished into light that casts no shadows. Every crane folded tightens the thematic coil until the basilica itself becomes a lantern of recorded sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds tightly: pressure builds via density of image and cadence shift toward closure. Orientation is immediate (“observatory drifted three kilometers above the dead zone”), and the 20-minute clock creates coherent urgency. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—potential becomes “infinitely remembered”—with undeniable cost (the breakers cooling, time lost, futures unredeemed). Every beat serves the tightening spiral toward that resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: decoding belonging as emotional resonance reweights the entire quest. Cost is legible—the pilgrim fled because the truth was too bright—and Elara transmits it anyway, accepting its burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with stellar imagery tightening into thematic resolution. Orientation is immediate (“Elara's drone hovered...”), and causality flows via astrographic logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the “sieved hush” and recurring motifs (watch hand, driftwood) building density toward a Conceptual Repricing: memory cannot be forged forever. Closure lands via Earned Stasis—he renounces his trade—and the cost is legible in the final image of the ticking watch hand symbolizing mended time. Orientation is clear by line 2 (who, where, when). No causality breaks, though the plaque discovery leans slightly coincidental without prior foreshadowing of its location.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the exchange completes, but forgiveness remains distant—a crystallized moment where trust is fragile yet enacted. The moon-phase ritual functions as both constraint and cadence, shaping timing and stakes coherently under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in Kael’s lingering doubt and the raven’s swallowed cry—history isn’t erased, only negotiated. Orientation is immediate (parapet, mist, moon), and causality flows through ritual, object, and choice without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with fog, poles, and memory layering into a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias shifts from seeking control to accepting presence. Cost is legible in the abandoned compass and cemetery-bound needle—symbols of relinquished guilt. Orientation is immediate (“coastal kayak launch”), and the closure image (stars aligned as he walks inland) reweights the entire journey with emotional consequence. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and recurring motifs (lake glow, newspaper, baseball), culminating in Charged Poise—Kael’s ascent with renewed purpose. Cost is legible in the tremor of collapsing timelines and the sterile corridor’s antiseptic air, symbolizing irreversible loss of old self. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces humanity to become a guardian of the liminal, with visible cost (loss of human form, voice, tears as moons). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—scent, spice, and moonlight accumulate into transformation. Orientation anchors immediately (“orchard,” “beast whisperer,” “permanent moonlight”). The phoenix’s ash and fortune cookie seed early constraints that shape tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: lost time isn’t gone but compressed into luminous cracks—a reweighting of the premise with undeniable emotional cost (“the crack was how the light entered”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density builds via recurring motifs (hand-tracing, saucer, ink) until the final cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible in the body (“skin… the true tablecloth”) and the irreversible transformation of ritual. Orientation is immediate (“midnight glade,” “two weeks after birth”), and the single shard structure fits the scope flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maya refuses escape, choosing caretaking with full awareness of its eternal burden. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—each stitch deepens emotional density and lightens her mass until the final image crystallizes purpose. Cost is legible in “gravitationally light with purpose, heavy with love.” Orientation anchors instantly (“Maya lifted the photograph…”) and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael realizes saving and being saved are “the same motion,” reweighting his life’s logic with undeniable cost—complete destitution reframed as readiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the synchronizing bugs and planetary alignment intensify pressure not through plot turns but cadence and density. Cost is legible in the final image: emptiness as vessel, not lack. Every causal ripple (pig, bird, fish) remains offstage yet thematically coherent, never resolving conflict but deepening irony.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): every lock open, freedom disguised as malfunction, with conceptual cost legible in the commandant’s betrayed seal. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic from sundial to quill to powder room. Orientation anchors by line 3; the blackout functions as disorientation that pays off at closure. Persistent constraint: Seren’s lock-pick expertise shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s renunciation crystallizes under aurora light, with her shadow’s dissolution as legible cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via rock placement, eel vectors, and dust flare until the decisive fade. Orientation is immediate (“tidal bluff,” “Elara,” “after friction vanished”), and the single scene coheres without disorientation penalty. The final image reconfigures the premise: friction’s partial return through eel-grooves makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the poet realizes scars are terrain to walk, not maps to read—a reweighting of silence itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure intensifies via storm, timer, envelope, culminating in the self-authored message that crystallizes his stance. Cost is legible: he forgoes immediate dissemination, choosing instead to preserve truth in hidden transit. Orientation is clear by line 3; the single scene coheres without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Rhen reweights “questions” as “destinations,” crystallizing a new epistemology through action. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via layered motifs (sundial, needle card, brook) that converge at the climax. Cost is legible in the opponent’s stumble and Rhen’s earned certainty. Orientation is immediate (“glass atrium,” “mechanical arm”), and causality flows through pattern recognition rather than plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he chooses to retain the poet’s voice despite the molt, anchoring himself to collective resistance—a decisive refusal with conceptual cost (abandoning fluid anonymity). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via layered images (rust, stars, seed-poem) until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in “the seed-poem... anchored him to the cause” and the luminous fracture image. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compasses align, the storm recedes below, and he accepts an open-ended hope rather than rewriting the past. Cost is legible—the silent clock remains broken, fingers bleed—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring motifs that reconfigure meaning. The pattern of flickering → stillness, dissonance → encore, steely longing → quiet defiance coheres without causality breaks. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the two-shard structure (station → arbor) transitions cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ridge awakens, reframing memory as living mycelium, not static archive. Cost is legible—the island avoids fragmentation, but Kael inherits perpetual doubt (“had he preserved memory or created fiction?”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: binary blooms → story-gold petals, dream matrices → sung frequency, all converging in a cadence shift at planting. Orientation is immediate (“The ridge had been blooming...”), stakes clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the compass now points to the juniper, symbolizing transformed longing. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—tides, lace, pigment, and wire layer into a coherent ritual logic. Cost is legible in the “faintest tint of blue-green” on new needles: unspoken apologies diffuse but persist. Every shard (dock arrival, table scene, seasonal stay, departure) coheres under one emotional tide, taught by the opening mist and paid off in conservatory light.
