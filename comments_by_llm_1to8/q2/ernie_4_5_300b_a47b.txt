  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (canyon, dawn, Lirael kneeling) and follows a clear Accumulative lens: frost patterns → crevice → chamber → shard revelation → thematic resolution. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page cost; Lirael's shift from survival hollowness to purposeful teaching is narrated as future intent rather than a present action that forecloses a path. The ledger and shard provide discovery beats, but the final paragraph summarizes her new direction rather than dramatizing a charged choice or renunciation with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated workbench sessions, and closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael reframes the capsize memory as generative rather than only traumatic. The final image of the conservatory as "language waiting to be learned" reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (acceptance of permanent voicelessness). However, the leap to "concert halls worldwide" compresses causality in the final third, and the core turn—mapping the mother's lullaby—lacks visible friction or failed attempts that would tighten pressure before success.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative shading. Orientation anchors arrive by ~word 40 (Elias, his doorstep, the crate). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias finds "his permanent address" by staying), but cost is asserted in retrospect—"traded his shovel for a quill"—rather than shown in a decisive scene. The lens-activation beat is vivid, yet the climactic choice to remain is summarized across "Years later" without dramatizing the foreclosed option or the friction of letting go. Causality holds through the middle (dream → descent → lens repair) but the ending compresses the final turn into exposition, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens—causal linkage (Mira traces donations, rings bell, sparks visible change) interwoven with accumulative texture (the arbor's recurring presence, the bell's evolution from silent relic to daily celebration). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the community shifts from anonymous survival to named solidarity, and the cost is legible in the ceased donations and the widow's whispered acknowledgment. However, the escalation feels telescoped—the solstice declaration and the "days that followed" compress what could be a pressure-filled middle into summary, weakening the felt weight of the gamble. One meaningful tightening occurs (bell rings, names are spoken, system changes), satisfying the length requirement, but the cost arrives more as reported outcome than on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into summary. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—finding unused love in "spaces between breaths"—is abstract philosophy stated rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The journey from viaduct to clearing to pool reads as transit without narrowing options or raising price. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the ending tells us she found peace without showing what she sacrificed or how her stance crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: visions layer, the fragment pulses, photographs flicker, then the garden reforms with the images "stabilized." Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (who, where, when). However, the closure moment—photographs now glowing, visions replaced by "quiet certainty"—lacks visible cost: Elara leaves smiling with a plan to design a memorial maze, but no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered. The fragment becomes "dull and inert," yet this loss doesn't constrain her next move. The resonant reconfiguration is gestured at ("time wasn't a texture...but a story") but the conceptual repricing is told rather than made undeniable through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    The opening delays spatial orientation (carnival prize redemption center, chains, piano bench upstairs) past 120 words, creating initial fog. Drive lens reads as hybrid causal-symbolic, but the closure—seeds exploding and rooting instantly—introduces a late magic-realist rule without prior cuing, breaking earned causality. The scavengers appear as convenient pressure in the final third without prior setup, and Lirael's decision to hurl the vial feels reactive rather than motivated by prior tactical narrowing. Cost at closure (freeing the seeds vs. keeping them) is gestured at but not legibly weighed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece tracks one continuous scene in the greenhouse with clear spatial choreography. However, closure relies on a device she assembles that "emits a final, resonant tone" of her father's ship sinking—this memory crystallization is asserted rather than dramatized, and no on-page cost or foreclosed option is visible in the final beat. The ending gesture ("she smiled, battered but marveling") claims triumph without showing what she has sacrificed or what path is now closed.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a clear causal sequence: Elara plans, bypasses defenses, trades the photo, escapes. However, the jar's "test" arrives conveniently at the climax without prior setup, and the exchange itself lacks genuine friction—the jar "transforms" rather than takes, softening the cost. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she's reinterpreted the rules), but the conceptual shift is told more than felt. The drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture; it holds, but the ending's cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes orientation cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraph) and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Kael shifts from seeking blueprints to embracing imperfection. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective rather than causal; the discovery of the schematics in the hidden compartment does not narrow options or raise stakes—he simply packs them and leaves. The ending reconfigures his stance, but the cost (abandoning "perfect answers") is conceptual and asserted rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or trade-off dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempt—Lila withholding the shell from Marisol—lands weakly because the prior causality (decrypting notes, reciting them aloud to the enforcer) does not establish why this move would "outwit" him or lead to his confession weeks later; the arrest happens off-page via summary. Orientation is delayed: who Lila is and why she's in the library aren't anchored until the third paragraph, and the DNA-test reveal competes with the immediate library stakes. One meaningful tightening (enforcer arrival) exists, but the resolution bypasses on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara layers silences to complete the map, and the final image (glowing scroll, gold flakes on hands) reweights the opening hush. However, the closure lacks clear cost—she "wasn't afraid," the task is simply "done," and tomorrow's return is asserted without dramatized consequence. The map's completion feels ornamental rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The temporal loop sequence provides a structural turn, but the mechanics remain abstract—Unit-17 "exists in all eras simultaneously" without dramatized friction or navigation cost. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing through the mundane-mysticism exchange, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; the robot simply resumes sweeping with "new clarity" and no foreclosed path. The causal link between touching the violin and accessing timelines is convenience rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: ticket → lens → map → crystals → dawn realization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias accepts silence as language, stops writing logs), but the cost remains ambient rather than sharp—no relationship severed, no job forfeited, no concrete price paid on the page. The drive lens holds, yet the final image ("doodled a lens in the margin") charges theme more than it reconfigures options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: marbles accrue meaning, the mentor-student exchange deepens understanding, and the final image about blooming through wounds attempts Conceptual Repricing. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—Joren simply adopts a marble with no visible forfeiture or friction, and the maze's response ("seemed to respond") is too vague to constitute felt consequence. The CR reads asserted rather than earned through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening, and the piece follows a single continuous scene in one POV. The inferred lens is Causal: lever pull → nexus flare → flora/creatures stir → destabilization → recalibration → stabilization. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Veyra's smile and reach for the lever again do not foreclose a path or reweight prior material with felt consequence. The escalation (destabilization crisis) resolves via technical adjustment without altering Veyra's options or stance, making the ending a soft reset rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: symbols emerge, pattern recognition deepens, and the final promise reweights Clara's stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she commits to finishing the symphony with the code "etched into her mind"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legibly foreclosing an option. Orientation anchors (flooded pit, Clara, lanterns) arrive promptly. The sequence proceeds through discovery beats (program dipped, symbols bleed, date revealed, promise made) with coherent accumulation, but the final image's cost is asserted through mood ("held its breath") rather than shown as a tactical or relational price Clara pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (station, Lirael, post-fever). The piece accumulates density through repeated smudging, peripheral noticing, and the QUARANTINE folder discovery, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she refuses the oracle role, descends with the illustration, accepts being "anchored" rather than crushed). Cost is felt—she abandons her position, the director will rage—and the final herbalist exchange reweights the bearberry's meaning. One meaningful deepening is present; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when by the opening and delivers a Decisive Change (Elias finds the mill's buried secret and leaves the valve as sentinel), but the causal chain weakens mid-sequence: the valve "fit perfectly" and the hologram appears without dramatized resistance or cost to access. The climactic revelation—workers panicked, the collapse was a cover-up—arrives via exposition dump rather than through Elias's discovery choices. Closure lands with conceptual cost (the truth is "too heavy to carry"), but the final image of leaving the valve doesn't reweight prior tactics or constrain a visible option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its patterned progression early (four folds, each opening a new chamber) and follows through with a coherent deepening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper returns transformed, their burden now "a bridge," with visible cost ("grip on reality now a faint echo"). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph. The cost is legible in the keeper's shedding of self and the swan's abandonment, though the final paragraph's summary mode slightly softens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a single scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors (Sage Ridge, eclipse progression). The dominant stake—whether Mara will accept "ordinary magic"—receives a tightening when the curl glows, but this reversal is not causally earned by Mara's prior choices; it occurs passively in her palm. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Mara shifts stance, tucks the curl away), yet the cost is conceptual at best—no legible price paid, no path foreclosed. The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative (eclipse + music + shared moment accumulate pressure), but the glow functions as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through Clara's diary fragments, the tapestry's hidden symbols, and the final chorus of voices. Orientation is anchored early (silo library, Elias, post-dream world). The closure—axis shifting back "by recognition"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no concrete forfeiture is visible on the page. The piece coheres under its lens, but the final image's pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: lighthouse, Elara, midnight, storm. The discovery of the safehouse and letters provides a turn, and the ending plants a cookie with the dockworker—yet the closure reads more as setup than transformation. The cost of continuing her father's shadow war is declared but not felt on the page; she "smiles" and the "game is afoot," which undercuts the gravity. The accumulative lens is signaled but the final image lacks the reweighting that would charge it with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (the tunnel descent), but the ending opts for confidence over consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough, but "dimensional anchor," "possession," and "merging dimensions" remain abstract throughout. The closure unit—anchor disintegrates, replaced by "swirling nexus"—lacks visible or felt cost; the priest simply walks away satisfied. Causal lens inferred but undermined: loops "unravel stillness" via rhetorical questions without showing how questions mechanically alter the anchor. The stated stakes ("before possession completes") never materialize as on-page pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.9)
    Orientation is clear (who, where, when by opening), but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The piece moves from dawn setup through reflection to writing fortunes, ending with affirmation that "it was enough"—a satisfaction statement rather than a reweighted stake or forfeited path. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image should shift meaning or cost; here the nautilus hums, she writes, dawn continues, with no visible tightening or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but the lens oscillates between causal (tablet guides choices) and accumulative/textural (timeline montage). The closure—Mara touching ground and walking forward—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is told ("her heart heavy," "crumbled in her hands") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. The montage of alternate timelines functions as summary rather than motivated causality; we leap through possibilities without on-page pressure narrowing her options. The final image attempts to land cost ("not floating, not drifting, but grounded"), yet the transition from floating observer to grounded walker lacks a beat where a tangible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with the phonograph repair as anchor, and orientation is solid (who/where/when established early). The closure unit—Lila finding voice through hush—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract: we're told she "felt alive" and taught students, yet no specific forfeit or constraint shapes the final image. The needle "gift" realization is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. The backwards-record mechanism appears suddenly without prior setup, weakening causal linkage in what reads as a hybrid design.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (courtyard, dusk, storm recorder), and the pigeon message provides the inciting catalyst. The closure lands—Elias decides to share evidence and begins a new log entry—but the cost is asserted rather than felt: burning the parchment after deciding to "share" the truth is contradictory, and the woman's vial hand-off resolves a problem Elias didn't help create. The causal lens weakens when coincidence (the pigeon's arrival, the woman's emergence) drives key turns instead of protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening occurs (entering the zone), but the resolution depends on external rescue rather than Elias's prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late—who Kael is and why he's at the grotto emerge piecemeal across the first third, delaying stakes legibility (−0.4 per Orientation Test). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through rope-unraveling and grotto-wall transformations toward a final spiral image that reweights the premise. However, the closure unit—"the texture of time is not in the choices you make, but in the patterns they leave"—is told rather than shown, and the conceptual cost remains oblique; no on-page forfeiture or constraint crystallizes (Cost proof test failure: −0.5). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early enough, but the ending rests on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl's transformation from holding silence to holding potential, crystallized through community participation, reweights prior material with felt pressure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of sound-versus-silence deepens through density increase (music → bowl resonance → community offering → renewed music). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the bowl holds space rather than silence, shifting her understanding and altering the crowd's subsequent action. Cost is conceptual—the chronic grief acknowledged and transformed—but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraph. However, the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: Lira leaves "peaceful," Elias returns to his workbench "satisfied," and the final beat ("ready for the next client") resets to the initial state without reweighting stakes or options. The narrative follows a service-transaction structure (client arrives, product offered, client leaves) with no escalation that narrows Elias's choices or alters his stance. Under a Situational lens, no stance crystallization occurs; under Causal, no because/therefore linkage changes knowledge or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately (Clara at concert hall → library → boardinghouse → pier → library), but the causal chain is weak: the envelope's arrival by fan breeze is pure coincidence, and its contents (locket photo of a girl Clara saw that morning) resolve through another coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The closure—Clara hanging the photo and receiving Lila's postcard months later—offers thematic summary rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (recurring library, shells, music motifs) but the final image ("quiet promise that to uplift one was to uplift all") asserts theme rather than reweighting prior material through a charged particular. Cost is conceptual at best, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Kael's search gathers details (tags, Lira's clue, the final mural) toward a meeting that reweights his isolation. Orientation anchors (crystalline orchard, crater's edge, Kael's role) arrive early. The closure—Lira's identity reveal and their shared stance beneath the arbor—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: "luminescent ache… now shared" asserts connection without dramatizing what Kael forfeits or risks. The search itself involves minimal escalation; clues accumulate but do not narrow options or complicate tactics, weakening the before/after legibility required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the canal's pulsing, the pendant's heat, and the tunnel's revelations build density toward a final image of Lila sketching with new understanding. However, closure cost is implied rather than viscerally on the page—she "knew it wasn't over" and would "uncage time once more," but no concrete choice or foreclosed path appears in the final beat. The tunnel sequence delivers a conceptual repricing (the giant as guardian, echoes in pauses), yet the ending dilutes it with a promise of future action rather than a decisive present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is established early (cavern orchard, Elara, night ritual). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual intensifies through sensory layering (sap glowing, trees pulsing, mosaic shifting) to a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's realization that loss nourishes growth, crystallized when she stands with the glowing eyes. Cost is conceptual (accepting chaos over solving equations) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass eyes align with the stone's cracks, reweighting her understanding. The lens holds, though the causality is light.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: Mara finds tape → traces origin through pipe chases → discovers decoder → hears message. However, the closure is a realization ("she felt seen") without a decisive on-page cost or action that forecloses a path. The sense-memory conceit adds texture but does not tighten options or force a visible trade-off at the end. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (Eleanor, nursery, post-storm). The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure where Eleanor's realization reweights her relationship to control, but the cost remains abstract—no concrete path is foreclosed on the page. The hellebore scene offers a micro-turn (she withdraws her hand), yet the final vow ("I'm going to help them by releasing control") declares future intent rather than enacting change in the present window. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through storm imagery and plant motifs, but the closure unit lacks the undeniable felt price required for full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and moves from island exploration to studio application, offering a light causal chain (rain→brooch→stranger→pigment→painting shift). However, the closure hinges on convenience: the amber's catalytic power and the stranger's departure are asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure that narrows Marin's options. The final realization ("a conversation, ongoing") reads as conceptual repricing, but the cost is declared (insomnia eased, world reframed) rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or tactical consequence, weakening closure legibility under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the cave's song shifts through intensifying descriptions toward a final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cave's song returns "steady and clear" but "changed," and Elara feels "unseen forces now")—however, the cost is asserted rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The pilgrim's disappearance and the pearl's vanishing feel convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Lirael revisits sites, collects fragments, and the valve accrues meaning across three episodes. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the trumpet is restored, the harbor thrives, but no path is foreclosed for Lirael; the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than crystallizing a choice or renunciation that reweights prior material with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (vault, clocktower, Elias) arrive promptly. The piece follows a causal chain (arrows → wall mechanism → chamber → woman → updated map), but the closure hinges on handed wisdom ("fortress is a choice") rather than a decision Elias makes that changes his options with visible cost. The woman's ticket and updated map are gifted, not won; the final "smile, a trembling certainty" restates the opening affect without a legible before/after shift. A Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing requires undeniable pressure at the image; here the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (whales, tile, tower, Aelia's memories) toward a final reconfiguration where Clara accepts wonder over pure skepticism. Orientation anchors adequately (tower, cliff, sea) by the second paragraph. The closure—Clara pocketing the tile, softened skepticism—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is oblique: no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, only an internal stance shift declared in summary ("her skepticism softened by wonder"). The transcription sequence provides a tightening beat, yet the final image relies on assertion rather than a charged, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: storm weakens amulets → fragments synchronize → escape becomes possible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land early and the closure—shattering the amulets and falling through—occurs on the page with visible cost (losing immortality's certainty for the void's unknown). However, Lira's sudden appearance and instant exposition about the curse loop ("we've been trapped here...since before the first star burned out") weakens motivational causality; the reader must accept rather than discover this setup. The mirror showing "a version of himself who'd chosen to stay" provides motivation but arrives late as a planted nudge rather than emerging from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.9)
    Orientation anchors within 120 words (funeral home, Elara hiding, agents arrive). Closure unit is a Decisive Change (asylum secured, corrupt system to be dismantled) but the agents' reversal lacks on-page causality—they go from guns drawn to promising systemic reform in a single elided hour. The dummy-in-casket reveal is a setup paid off, but it doesn't narrow Elara's options or impose cost; she already controlled the scroll. Cost at closure is asserted ("find the mathematics of a fair trade") but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and what she does remain vague through the first third, with "gilded-leaf stationer" unexplained and no spatial anchor until the lamp appears. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Althea collects textures, then collects more textures, with no causal linkage or escalation. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; she simply continues her routine with townsfolk approval mentioned in summary. No visible or felt cost lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—Kael accepting his identity as Marcus Hale and vowing pursuit—lands on the page with a stance shift, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains abstract: "he had the tide" gestures at resources without specifying what he's risked or lost to reach this moment. The drive lens reads Accumulative (fragment-gathering toward identity), but key causal links are elided: how do the captain's letters, the widow's heirloom, and the poison label actually point to a conspiracy? The mosaic of clues is asserted rather than dramatized into a coherent through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands—a resonant reconfiguration where Lira stops explaining the stars and accepts mystery—but the cost is felt only obliquely; the "ache in her chest" is mentioned but not dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. Causality is mostly linear (she finds the cello, plays it, the riddle is solved), and the astronomer's vanishing at 11:59 PM / dials stopping at 12:00 AM feels like symbolic decoration rather than a constraint that shaped her tactics. The piece teaches an accumulative lens (hum builds, shadows shift, dials spin) but the escalation is atmospheric rather than a meaningful tightening of options; the shell-and-cello synergy appears late and resolves the problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative texture (graffiti symbols accruing meaning). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Council withdrawal after Lira's visual argument—occurs on the page but the cost is abstract: "The fight wasn't over" tells rather than shows a forfeited option or altered relationship. The spiral-square symbol discovery and vendor map construction provide one meaningful tightening, but the Council's retreat feels coincidental (they "withdrew" without Lira's action forcing a trade-off), weakening causal closure. The chip's role as historical anchor is set up but its presence at the confrontation does not decisively alter tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure (the archivist's discovery, Lira's reflection years later). However, the final third fragments into summary epilogue rather than landing a single on-page closure beat with felt cost—Lira never learns her message was found, so the "outlasting" registers as thematic assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dawning hush as image, hourglass grain as motif), but the closure disperses across multiple time frames without a clear tightening that reweights the dominant stake with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (who/where/when) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Causal: drone malfunction → diagnosis via water basin → patch and recalibration → successful flight. However, closure lacks felt cost—Lira completes the repair without sacrifice, and the final image ("another drone awaited repair") offers Stasis without visible foreclosure or price. The launch of *Horizon's Breath* functions as backdrop rather than a pressure point that alters Lira's options. One tightening (servo discovery) occurs, but resolution arrives through competence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Clara receives map → treks north → discovers light source → returns transformed. However, the closure unit—her decision to mark the convergence and send travelers—feels like a professional pivot rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; we don't see what she's renounced or what path has been foreclosed. The discovery that "rivers are alive" arrives through external revelation (chipping ice) rather than earned causality from her prior choices, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tuning fork strikes build density, the footsteps multiply, the town's elements awaken in sequence. However, no on-page reversal or meaningful tightening occurs—each strike simply adds another layer of restoration without altering Kael's tactics or narrowing his options. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the town restored, Kael departing), but the cost is asserted rather than felt: "Balance, once restored, demands nothing less" is a thematic claim, not a visible forfeiture or trade-off visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (underwater temple, distress signal, three days). The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Mara placing the vial and "letting it go"—is unmotivated by prior beats; she enters wanting to decode/harness and exits having released with no on-page reversal or trade-off that changes her stance. The hush "shattering" and voices dissolving happens to her rather than through her agency. Cost is asserted ("lesson remained") but not dramatized in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. The closure reads as summary rather than a decisive change with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: copperlight, lattice blooms, and recursive imagery build toward the ending. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("I'm writing" stance, hovering above stones, father watching), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—Elias's renunciation or endurance forecloses no live option on the page. The bodies-to-be-found frame is set up early but never tightens his present choices; it remains atmospheric rather than a pressure that narrows tactics. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Elias, lighthouse prison, reef).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who-where-when anchors arrive piecemeal across the first two paragraphs without a clear present-tense frame until Elara's introduction. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric density building toward a release), but the closure—veil lifted, vortex opens, ghost dissolves—lacks visible cost; the greenhouse's transformation and the ghost's freedom feel granted rather than earned by prior sacrifice or renunciation. The backstory paragraph mid-story stalls momentum and the final "Thank you" dissolves tension into sentiment. No meaningful tightening or deepening under the chosen lens; the ending delivers relief without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear goal (mend the labyrinth via thread) and delivers an on-page transformation: the labyrinth shudders in recognition and the tide pools refill. Causality is present—Lira's thread-weaving causes the restoration—but the escalation is largely mechanical; each corridor is sewn without meaningful resistance or narrowing of options. The Resonant Reconfiguration qualifies (ruin to reverence achieved), yet the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("raw" fingers) rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or forfeiture that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the sundial glows, roots tremble, Lirael kneels—but cost is implied rather than legible on the page; we do not see what path she forecloses or what price she pays for choosing to follow. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The chamber discovery and sundial placement offer one meaningful tightening, sufficient for this length, but the final image ("It's not finished, but it's enough") abstracts rather than crystallizing options through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (chalk codes → clipboard analysis → fountain discovery → hologram). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (Lira commits to her grandmother's resistance work), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed—she smiles and tucks the letter away without visible sacrifice or narrowed options. The grandmother's hologram solves mysteries Lira did not help create on the page, undercutting earned causality at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The piece attempts a Hybrid lens—causal in the candle-revelation beat, accumulative in the cosmic-embroidery motif—but the closure unit lacks decisive on-page cost: the silk "changes" under flame, yet no tactical option narrows and no visible price is paid. The coup timeframe creates ambient tension but does not tighten choices on the page; Jaxon's telescope news and the "messenger star" complicate atmosphere without altering Zara's available moves. The final image ("truth is never what it seems… hidden in the seams") offers conceptual repricing, but the conceptual cost remains oblique—no social, relational, or opportunity price is legible in the ending lines.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael walks away "lighter" with the spirits' command "Go. Live. Speak."—but the cost is asserted ("no longer heavy") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. The moonlight ritual and condensation letters provide atmospheric deepening but no meaningful tightening of options or tactical constraint. The final image reconfigures emotional weight but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: mist, coral fragment, cast notes, and atrium recur with shifting emotional weight toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: coral placed between delegates, cast hung as "flag of fragile hope"). Cost is asserted abstractly ("lotus-hearted ache… lighter, a seed waiting to sprout") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or stakes narrowing on the page—the talks simply resume and a delegate touches the coral without on-page resistance or price paid by Lira. The lens holds, but the closure image depends on cooperative reception rather than protagonist sacrifice or choice under constraint, weakening felt cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the gathering crowd, musical addition, and Marla's dance, culminating in a cadence shift where the orchard moves from "lost" to "found." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the district's rediscovery) with visible cost implied in Lira's trembling hands and the question "What's next?" demanding continued labor. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established by ~80 words). The causal chain is motivated—fragment discovery leads to display, which sparks community gathering—though the leap from single display to district-wide transformation feels slightly compressed for the resistance the fog symbolizes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the garden hum, nickel placement, and mural activation build density toward the final image of Marisol "dancing" to awakening as rhythm. However, the closure effect—"awakening was not a destination, but a rhythm"—is stated rather than shown through a decisive image that reweights prior material with cost. The woman in the flapper dress and the lullaby are intriguing beats but dissolve without altering Marisol's options or crystallizing a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece attempts causal escalation (lecture crashes → pheromone test → club admission → garden activation) but the links read as "and then" rather than "because/therefore"—each gate opens conveniently when approached. The closure image (bioluminescent garden pattern) offers a visual reprise but no felt cost or foreclosed path; Elias simply succeeds and sips coffee the next morning, ready for "phase two." No meaningful tightening or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through centuries of migration, moss blooming, seed planting, and tree growth. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira singing into the wind with the tree responding, reweighting her silence into offering. However, the causal link between postcard arrival and moss bloom is elided, and the insomnia's dissolution happens offstage without a pivot moment. The postcard disappears and a seed appears with no on-page mechanism, weakening closure cost legibility despite the final image's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (glass-orchids, chime, extinct feelings) and the closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the chime is "repaired, though not as it had been," reweighting preservation as evolution rather than stasis. Cost is conceptual (accepting transformation over perfection) but lacks felt sting; Lirael's success is untroubled, and the final image charges theme without narrowing her options or exacting a visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes preservation demands creativity, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than stakes-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara's research discoveries (love letter, manuscript) pattern toward the call to Mira. However, the closure lacks felt cost—she simply calls, Mira answers warmly, and they agree to meet. The "river finally unblocked" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a renunciation or visible price. The research scenes function as illustrative work rather than because/therefore escalation; Henrik's midnight appearance and the restricted-section manuscript feel convenient rather than causally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the message transforms from encrypted fear to open trust), and the final image attempts to reweight prior material. However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt; Lira walks away satisfied, with no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed. Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (measurement, decryption, pattern-building converge), but the escalation consists of repeated measuring without a meaningful tightening that narrows options—she simply completes the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens—accumulative texture (dust-mote mapping, journal entries) braided with causal pressure (meteorite chip → decoding → discovery of Dr. Voss). Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The dream revelation and map epiphany provide a knowledge change, but the closure—Elias leaving with the chip—reads more as departure than decisive transformation; the cost of abandoning clients and pigeons is asserted in summary ("watching him go") rather than felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the final image lacks the reweighting charge required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (grain patterns, prisms, codes layering toward threshold-crossing). Orientation anchors arrive late—we learn Lira's age and backstory only after the opening image. The closure unit (stepping through the light-door, meeting father, walking with new codes) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("featherly determined," "didn't look back") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible loss. The butterfly-effect premise is told in abstract terms mid-story without altering on-page tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the luminous alignment providing structure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening. The alignment itself unfolds on-page with sensory accumulation, and the "shared exhale" ritual provides a ceremonial beat. However, the cost remains abstract—Mara's sense of belonging deepens, but no prior option is foreclosed and no tactical choice alters. The ending reconfigures her stance toward belonging, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the felt cost is more conceptual satisfaction than visible sacrifice or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and pursues one dominant stake (why paths disappear). The closure offers a conceptual repricing—paths are released, not forgotten—but the cost is purely intellectual; no on-page choice or forfeiture accompanies the insight. The final pool-vision sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, and Lira's options remain unchanged. Under a Causal lens, the link from conjecture → seeds → pool lacks embodied resistance or trade-off, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with stable POV. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the crowd moves, applauds, the teen commits to return), but the cost is weak—Lira catalogs reactions rather than facing a forfeited option or a stance that narrows her future. The lens is hybrid (accumulative texture building to a situational crystallization), held consistently, but the final image lacks the undeniable pressure or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece attempts a causal arc—steal dust, dance, inscribe verse—but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Lirael completes her goal without dramatized trade-off or consequence that alters her options. The nostalgia ban is declared but never tests her on the page; she dances, writes, and walks away with only the abstract promise that "the verse will fade by dawn." No meaningful tightening or narrowing of choices occurs, rendering the ending a summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, Pearl Bay, dawn) appear early, but the piece lacks a causally motivated turn or escalation. The sequence moves through description → wade → throw stone → watch → feel peace → write → leave without meaningful pressure or narrowing of options. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration framing ("before everything shifted"), but no on-page cost or change is legible—Elara departs lighter, her stance unchanged by friction. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead, the text cycles through atmospheric observations without tightening or felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, memory, and natural imagery to reweigh Elias's self-blame. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of scars as fertilizer, belonging in celestial rhythm), but the cost remains abstract—no specific path is foreclosed, no concrete price paid. The hourglass whispers resolution rather than Elias paying for it through renunciation or decision, weakening the felt weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through ritual patterning and the grotto's responsive energy, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara recognizes the grotto as crossroads and her trial balloons as bridges. Orientation is anchored early (grotto, Elara, altitude gauge). The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (she commits to continued trial cycles), but the cost is oblique—no visible foreclosure of a path or loss on the page. The needle pointing to "17" and the coordinate "only she could interpret" gesture toward mystery without legible stakes shift. One meaningful deepening occurs (vision of parallel skies), but because/therefore linkage is weak; the gauge's fluctuations feel decorative rather than causally tied to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes who/where/when by the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered discovery (diaries, fireplace debris, locket), and the final image (grandmother's photo, "You are the map") reweights the opening question with conceptual cost. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the legacy's burden shifts from uncovering secrets to carrying them forward—and the cost is felt in Lira's act of burning the negative. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the walls' dreams are not separate from her own, narrowing her interpretive frame and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the humming sequence builds through three mirrors toward a meadow vision, and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early. Orientation is solid (terrace, spring, prism parapet by line three). However, closure remains ambiguous—the mirrors "stood unchanged" yet Lirael "knew" possibilities were taking root elsewhere, an assertion that occurs off-page and lacks visible cost at the final image. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but cost legibility at closure is weak: exhaustion is mentioned but the walk-away doesn't reconfigure options or meaning with undeniable pressure, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the negotiation day, with a cadence shift at closure as Elara packs the clipboard and descends. Orientation anchors are clear (terrace, midsummer, dawn arrival). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara's acceptance that "the price of redemption would never be fully paid" reconfigures her stance with a felt cost (endurance of imperfect peace). One meaningful deepening occurs when "the atmosphere had shifted" and delegates' hostility softens, though the turn is summarized rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the salt flat ritual gathers density through layered gestures (placing egg, pouring water, hearing phantom song) that reweight the philanthropist's manufactured destruction. However, closure lacks on-page cost—the protagonist "never checked" the egg's fate and immediately moves to a luxury resort, which reads as soft reset rather than Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The final paragraph's "that was enough" is asserted rather than made undeniable through a final image that forecloses options. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors present early); lens holds but closure RR/CR is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear goal (unlock the sanctuary, free the echoes) and delivers a Decisive Change when the door opens and echoes are released. However, orientation is delayed—who Lirael is beyond her label and why this specific night matters remain vague past the 120-word mark. The causal chain is thin: she dances, threads respond obediently, door opens; no reversal or complication tests her method. Cost at closure is asserted ("her spirit unburdened") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—"a campfire, flickering in the dark, inviting you to lean in"—that reweights the ethical-storytelling premise through image rather than statement. Cost is conceptual (accepting half-truths as "the only kind worth telling") but legible. The middle deepening (reversing the puppet roles, crowd laughter as release) provides one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early. The piece structures as one extended scene but delivers no decisive change or felt cost at closure—Lirael exits affirming the same purpose she entered with. The monarch's visit is framed as transformative ("its visit had changed her") yet no prior option is foreclosed and no tactic shifts on the page. The final image recycles her opening stance without reweighting it. Closure reads as restatement, not reconfiguration, and cost remains asserted rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The closure—Lira's appearance and the glowing names—reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: Kael's "raw but steady" hands do not foreclose a live option or trade-off on the page. The drive lens is Causal with motivational ellipsis (years of casting bells → this ritual), but the final beat's mechanics (rope shudders, light coalesces, figure materializes) bypass protagonist agency; luck or artifact power resolves rather than Kael's choice under pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rope begins to glow, but no persistent constraint shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (met). Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (storm energy, symbolic wafer seal, dream fragments) but never commits; the hologram exposition interrupts pattern-building and the ending toggles to a declarative epiphany rather than a charged image reweighting prior material. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; Mara "understood" and "smiled" but no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no felt price paid. The closure unit is an assertion ("to become its architect") not a dramatized shift. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a single sentence in the ending where a visible or felt cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: pressure accumulates through discovery beats (reliefs → recessed panel → chamber → merging tiles) without strong because/therefore links. Closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration via internal stance shift ("covenant with herself"), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture of coin, safety, or alternate path is dramatized. The voice intones cosmic patience yet resolves with a smile and lightened steps, undercutting felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. The piece follows a mosaic pattern (five visitor vignettes within the sanctuary), but the transitions are list-like ("Others came—a man bitter over lost love...") rather than taught or legible under pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Lirael accepts that "resentment would creep back" but "for now... grace had shifted"), yet the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint emerges on the page. The accumulative lens is signaled but not consistently deepened; each visitor beat resets rather than tightening options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a final Conceptual Repricing: the sextant's needle reversal reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (workshop, orchard district, evening). However, the stranger's journey and the dream's "capture" occur off-page, and the cost—what Elias or the stranger forfeit—remains abstract. The needle-reversal image reconfigures meaning but the felt price is oblique, landing just above functional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The breach provides backstory context, but the present-tense climb and mending sequence feels more like a demonstration than a causal chain with narrowing options. The quartz-eye repair succeeds without meaningful resistance, and the orchard's blooming response reads as reward rather than a reversal or deepening that changes Lira's tactics. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she has stayed and will continue), but the cost—years of persistence—is told rather than dramatized in this single scene's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with late Situational pressure. The orchard visit unfolds through linked discoveries (blank cameo → etched shell → grotto vision → tree fusion), and the final act—fusing the cameo—reconfigures her relationship to the inheritance. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure reads as Charged Poise: she inherits by choice, the orchard exhales, and her disquiet is "brightened," but the felt cost is oblique—what exactly has she renounced or risked? The board's disapproval is mentioned but never constrains a tactic on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (grotto vision narrows to the tree), sufficient for this length, but the price lacks sharp definition.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens infers as Causal with Accumulative undertones (maze, diary cipher, gaps). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elara entering the library with Kael after proving her worth—reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost remains abstract: she "embraced the unknown," yet no specific forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible on the page. The "renegotiate" mechanic structures the plot, but Kael's overnight vanishing and the guardian's sudden test feel more like plot convenience than inevitable pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (decode *Silence* shelf), but the final image lacks the felt weight required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece signals a quest structure and delivers a garden discovery, but causality is thin: the emerald card "glows faintly" and a seed "sprouts instantly" without mechanical groundwork. The closure—planting their name and feeling "whole"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown; what path was foreclosed? The orientation anchor (ship, fog, twins) arrives early, and the two-shard structure (exterior deck → interior garden room → meadow) is legible, but the Drive Lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid with weak because/therefore linkage in the middle third. The garden's existence is told rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a causal chain: Elara investigates → recognizes pattern → reconfigures rope → opens door → reads scroll → returns. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (her identity crystallizes as "weaver of timelines"), but the cost remains abstract; no prior option or tactic is visibly foreclosed. The scroll's light "piercing the ceiling" and her return to a closed door suggest reversal, yet the change in her situation or knowledge after copying the text is told rather than dramatized with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sonic imagery, and the final placement of the bloom reweights the dominant stake with a cadence shift into silence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands on the page—bloom placed, silence restored—but the cost is conceptual (energy beings muted) rather than viscerally felt through a visible forfeiture or sacrifice that alters the mapkeeper's options.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative lens that deepens through Elara's retrocognitive visions and hands-on attempts. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the beacon rekindled, survivors drawn) with thematic cost legible in the line "even in darkness, there are fragments of light worth rekindling." Yet the storm-night breakthrough relies on coincidental moonlight refraction rather than prior causal tightening, and the prism's sudden eruption of light from "the pavilion itself" introduces a late mechanism that wasn't seeded, weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fog solidifies → Lirael descends → shadows measured → fog cracks → insight. The pattern coheres, but closure relies on told realization ("understanding now") rather than an image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (observatory, Lirael, solid fog event). One meaningful deepening occurs (from recording to participating), yet the final paragraph's thematic summary dilutes the RR potential; the crystal's hum "a little louder now, as if in approval" gestures toward Charged Poise but stops short of undeniable pressure or a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "blooming fortress," "fire-lilies," and her mentor's disappearance, but the fortress's actual nature (inhabited? abandoned?) and Lira's immediate tactical goal remain vague past the 120-word mark. The closure—lilies blooming as she realizes "shadows" mean unlit potential—offers a conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("she's learned to defy gravity") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via the spreading flame), yet the escalation is more descriptive than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—tide imagery, cicada symbolism, and reflective density build toward a cadence shift when Elara speaks the cicada metaphor aloud and Kael nods. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pause has "done its work," conversation isn't over, but the stance has crystallized with a visible relational cost (the sustained tension, the indirection required). Orientation is clean. The escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for the lens. Cost is felt but somewhat diffuse—the "path forward" is foreseen but not yet paid for in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, situation). The piece follows a causal lens: gravity inverts → Lila ascends → doll is lost → sprout appears, creating a legible before/after with cost (loss of anchor object, gain of hope-seed). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the doll is gone, irretrievable). Minor slip: the sprout's arrival "one morning" after "days" of mourning compresses the causal payoff into summary rather than dramatizing the discovery beat, slightly dulling the closure image's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly (gondola operator, prism terrace canal, post-whistle night). The dominant stake—understanding silence to heal the terrace's anxiety—is signaled early. However, the closure hinges on a realization ("silence itself was speaking") that arrives through passive observation of the vial rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses options. The conceptual repricing is present but the felt cost is unclear; Elara's tomorrow plan feels additive rather than a foreclosure of a prior path, weakening the closure's charge under a causal or accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding the penalty. However, the closure unit—Lira recognizing her face in the mural—lands as a conceptual repricing without legible cost on the page; the throne "was never unclaimed" reframes the quest but forecloses no visible path and exacts no felt price. The drive lens reads as causal through the middle (ruby flake → stairway) but shifts to thematic assertion at the end without dramatized consequence, failing the cost proof test. Apply −0.6 for closure without on-page cost and −0.3 for lens drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: ashen sanctuary, doorknocker ritual, Kael's threshold crossing, and the closing image of held hands under starlight cohere as a pattern of reconnection. Orientation is prompt (ashen sanctuary, Elara as keeper, pre-call context), and the lens holds. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from isolation to shared vigilance—but the cost is asserted ("for the first time in years, Elara felt the possibility of breath") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or visible friction at the threshold moment, keeping the effect more told than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads as Causal with weak linkage: the quantum device buzzes near the bolt, messages appear, Mara turns it, problem solved. The closure—"Pressure translated. Diamonds are a metaphor"—lands as told resolution rather than a decisive change with felt cost; Mara's grin and the final text feel like rewards, not foreclosures. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. One tightening occurs (diamonds trembling, farm at risk) but the reversal is externally cued by the device, undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal sequence: crank → visions → compartment → letters → resolve. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (moving from "tomb" to "cradle"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option appears on the page. The letters deliver exposition that tells rather than dramatizes the dynasty's choice, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (situational pressure accumulating toward conceptual repricing) but shifts register multiple times—mystical catalog, action sequence, lyric field transformation—without teaching the pattern early. Closure arrives as conceptual repricing: "The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured...a pattern to be felt," reweighting the alchemists' error. However, the cost is asserted ("footsteps leaving no prints," greenhouse crumbling) rather than felt in a choice that forecloses a live path. The orientation anchor (greenhouse, endless night, Cedric) arrives promptly, so no penalty is applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds pattern (dust, button, gaps in records) and accumulates evidence toward the final reweighting. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elias recognizes the button as a token of intergenerational loss and opens "Unknown Histories"—but the cost is conceptual only, not felt or visible on the page. The final beat ("he knew enough to magnify the small kindnesses hidden in the gaps") states theme rather than dramatizing a forfeiture or stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs (the date on the button recontextualizes the boy's story), satisfying minimum escalation, but the ending lands as thematic echo rather than a choice with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with action-adventure beats. Orientation anchors (Mara, auric lagoon, rebel mission) land early. The inciting pressure (drones sweeping, three-minute window) propels the infiltration sequence, and the relay-station discovery provides a clear goal. However, causality weakens at closure: the drones retreat after the explosion with no on-page cost to Mara's mission—she surfaces with the drive intact, distributes it, and smiles as if success were guaranteed. The "holding the line" closure lacks visible friction or trade-off; we see no political consequence, personal forfeit, or tactical narrowing that reweights prior stakes. One tightening (the alarm and dive) is present, but the ending image (warm key, fading gold, winking stars) offers poetic summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, music, and the figure's dissolution accumulate into a closure image where the prophecy is "hushed" and the grotto returns to radiant beauty. The orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). However, the cost at closure is abstract—Elias "wonders if he'd truly hushed the prophecy or merely postponed it," then feels "strange peace" without a legible price paid on the page. The final image recharges the dewdrops and prism atrium, but the stakes remain conceptual rather than felt; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the threat dissolves, mood shifts to peace), but the ambiguity about whether anything was truly resolved weakens the felt cost, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonstone dust triggers discovery, the monuments gather light, leaves reveal their message. However, the closure dissolves into a three-item action plan rather than a single decisive image or reconfiguration; the cost of decoding (what Elinor forfeits or risks by acting) remains abstract. The dust "dissolving into air" gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, cave, pocket watch) land within the opening paragraph. The compass quest provides a throughline, and the fall/retrieval sequence offers a physical reversal, but the closure pivot—from seeking answers to embracing questions—relies heavily on reflection rather than a final on-page choice with visible cost. The workshop scene plants seeds but doesn't dramatize what Elias sacrifices or forecloses by shifting stance. Lens reads Causal-Hybrid but wobbles toward thematic summary at the end, weakening the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Kael, foundry, post-search). The closure lands on-page as Kael reaches for Lira and closes on empty air—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where options crystallize and the cost (her permanent absence, his acceptance) is felt. Lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid: the coin drop triggers the vortex, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than advancing new plot points. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira appears and reframes his search. Cost is legible but slightly abstract; the "empty air" line delivers the final emotional price, though the setup feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece follows a single continuous scene under a Causal lens: Lira pursues the sound, encounters the figure, admits fear, offers the tooth, and receives the laughter-feeling. However, the closure unit—laughter spreading through her chest, then the tooth pulsing—lacks a legible cost or decision that forecloses a path; the spectral figure vanishes without consequence, and Lira's return walk asserts hope rather than demonstrating a trade-off. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("healing was not a destination—it was a pursuit") tells rather than reweights prior material through image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where within opening lines; timeframe ("after anesthesia wears off") is present but remains vague across the walk. The woman's emergence at midpoint supplies a micro-turn, and the final walk offers a stance shift (hope, willingness to continue), which qualifies as Charged Poise under a Situational lens. Cost is oblique—he still holds the strap, steps are "sure," but no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Under Situational/Hybrid, the crystallization is legible but the cost proof test is marginal: the ending asserts clarity and hope without showing what tangible path or stance he has renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (alchemist's market, Lira, translator role). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through atmospheric layering, but the closure—Lira carrying the fragment and reflecting on translation—offers no decisive change, visible cost, or reconfigured stance. The weaver's exposition ("This lens held the memory...") substitutes for on-page pressure. The ending summarizes theme rather than landing a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when), satisfying the baseline test. The inferred lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, cracks, hidden compartment layer toward a thematic realization. However, the closure—ghosts fading after Elias finds papers and the clown whispers thanks—lacks visible cost; Elias nods with "understanding" but no tactic changed, no path foreclosed on the page. The final image ("a little less lonely") is asserted mood, not a reweighted stake with felt pressure. Under Accumulative terms, the ending needed a cadence shift or density break that charges prior material; instead it dissolves into summary relief.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors setting and character by the second paragraph (acceptable under the Orientation Test). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual (dew collection, frost study, press work), and the spiral's appearance triggers the rupture. However, the closure—"the awakening had begun"—is proclaimed rather than landing with on-page cost; the library "floats higher" and patrons "begin to rebuild" without a felt price or a visible before/after legible to the reader. The rupture itself is spectacle (books fly, glass cracks) but the final image disperses into summary ("new spiral formed, waiting") rather than a crystallized reconfiguration. Cost is conceptual at best and not made undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with heavy exposition. The piece declares a dispute, a vase destroyed by lackeys, and a plan, but the core pressure—covering mirrors during a storm—occurs off-page in summary ("He began...he draped...the storm arrived"). The fungi blooming is a convenient reveal that solves the dispute without on-page friction or cost. Orientation is delayed (baroque asteroid, cobalt time haze, Council lackeys) until paragraph two, but the effect does not pay off at closure. The ending summarizes weeks of dispute rather than dramatizing a single decisive change, leaving closure as conceptual assertion rather than felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Closure lands on-page: the box plays true when Lira admits her husband's lie, fulfilling a Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens (truth → stone flares → box repairs). The cost is legible—Lira must vocalize a painful truth—and the mechanics (starlight thread, tethering) follow established rules. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias identifies the moral ailment and Lira's confession enables the repair. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the descent, psychometry flashes, and lagoon encounter, building to a final image of the compass and jars. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "the absence of [answers]" and "mysteries meant to stay unsolved" reweight the premise. Cost is conceptual (hunger for more, acceptance of the unknowable) but legible. One minor orientation slip: "after the factory shut down" anchors time early, but the connection between factory waste and the lagoon's purity could be more causally explicit in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor quickly, but "after the GPS failed three days ago" introduces a timeframe that never constrains a choice on the page (−0.3). The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing—Lira now understands the island's complexity as tapestry—but the shift lacks visible or felt cost; she smiles and continues sculpting with new knowledge, no path foreclosed. The portal sequence and grandmother encounter read as expository rather than causal pressure that narrows options. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the ending does not reweight the dominant stake with cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece spans months ("across the melting of winter's last snow" through "By summer") via summary rather than a coherent scene or two-shard structure, violating scope defaults without teaching a mosaic pattern. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she's restoring isn't anchored until after the postcards are introduced. The closure—Mara smiling as "the window's final layer remained etched but unbroken, a promise of mysteries yet to unfold"—offers no decisive change or felt cost; it's an open promise that defers resolution off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is functional (zeppelin, dunes, lagoon anchored early), but causality fractures at key junctures: Mara's descent into tunnels occurs because the ghost "leads," not from protagonist agency; the antagonist's sudden appearance in the chamber is convenient staging, and his defeat via trapdoor is unearned by prior set-up. The closure—diary pages now blank, "truth's out there"—asserts resolution without showing what changed on the page or what Mara forfeited. No persistent constraint shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through gathering artifacts and layering memory rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the cove reawakens through collective memory), but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—Elias watches rather than forfeits or renounces. The bottle "glowing faintly" and the net filling with fish occur without clear causal linkage to his prior actions, weakening the sense that his method constrained or enabled the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (garden, skyscraper, wax shaving). The structure is a single continuous scene with embedded memory; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory layering toward the final realization. However, the closure—Voss understanding the prophecy as "awakening" and resolving to archive it—lacks visible cost or a felt decision that forecloses an option. The "not to stop the storm, but to listen" stance is poised but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it reads as confirmation of intent rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The egg hatching provides a structural through-line, and the vortex demands a sacrifice, but the closure—sprouting seeds, creature vanishing, sapling appearing—unfolds via assertion rather than causal linkage the reader can trace. The stated paradox (introduce disorder to decrease entropy) is told, not dramatized through on-page choices with visible tradeoffs. The final image (melting ice, diamond dust, wild laugh) offers lyric resonance but no legible cost that forecloses a path or reweights prior stakes. Under a Causal lens the closure unit lacks visible because/therefore; under Accumulative the pattern does not tighten or break with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (tower, bell, solstice) and follows a clear causal chain: glue dampens tone → switch rope → storms agitate → alternate rhythm calms. Closure arrives on-page as Lira "switches her approach," embracing the hush as guide—a conceptual repricing with felt cost (aching arms, vigilance). However, the cost remains light and the final image ("knowing that zero hour had passed, but her work wasn't done") summarizes rather than crystallizes pressure. The lens reads Causal but the ending diffuses into reflection rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately within the opening. However, the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: Zara returns with stardust in the lantern, Veyra softens, and both "found a truth worth holding"—but no option has been foreclosed, no stance crystallized with price. The walk to the crater and the star's fadeout are atmospheric but do not tighten or alter Zara's position. Under an Accumulative lens the ending would need a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; under Causal it would need a because/therefore link that narrows options—neither is present.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias speaks, the box shatters, and the covenant is "untangled." However, the cost is asserted rather than felt—what does Elias lose by breaking his silence? The ghosts simply fade, the oasis "sighs," and he feels "light," which reads like convenience rather than foreclosed options. The accumulative lens is legible but the ending skips the price required for 7+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: Elias's realization that time's texture lies in object-memory rather than clocks, leaving the urn fragment in the silo as a ritualized cost. However, the causal chain from "placing fragment beside coil" to "mercury stills" to "shadows shift" to "wife's face flickers" reads more like symbolic logic than motivated escalation. The architect's damaged capsule functions as backstory rather than on-page obstacle, and the resolution hinges on an epiphany ("He understood now") rather than a decision that narrows options. Cost is present but oblique: the fragment's abandonment signals closure, yet the stakes never tighten into a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt lagoon, Lira, post-rain). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: debris gathered, kelp woven, feather placed, song hummed, tapestry completed. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page—the tapestry's planned dissolution by morning is told in reflection, not dramatized. The kite-string snap functions as atmospheric cue rather than causal catalyst; removing it would not break the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (temple orchard, living stone pillars, Lira's task). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: copper-wrapping beats intensify until the golden-light climax and spirit acceptance, then the final dawn reprise. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lira's final breath held by the orchard—with conceptual cost (her death seals the bridge). The lens holds and the RR lands on the page, but the cost feels thematic rather than tactilely paid in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately and attempts Accumulative/Textural mode via sculptures and amber catalyst. However, the closure—Lirael's ache of longing and Kael's mirror metaphor—remains abstract; the visible cost is not legible on the page in concrete terms. The amber dissolves, the world inverts, then nothing changes except Lirael's internal state, which is told rather than shown through a choice or forfeiture that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the coachman's ritual scattering of seeds and mixing of fertilizer accumulates meaning toward the final image of flowers swaying like flames. However, no decisive tightening or deepening occurs—he begins planting, continues planting, and rides away with "heart light." The Orientation Test is satisfied (coachman, jetty, twilight established early), but the closure lacks visible cost: the garden "will" bloom tomorrow, the battlefield "is becoming" a garden, yet no on-page price is paid or option foreclosed. The storm gathering on the horizon offers atmospheric charge but doesn't reweight the stakes or force a renunciation. The piece reads as a meditation on hope rather than a story with legible before/after pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The accumulative lens (riddle-solving pattern) is taught early and holds through closure. However, the ending delivers thematic statement ("love grows when shared") rather than a decisive change with visible cost—Hush has already found her purpose by dawn, so the final riddle answer feels ornamental. The "cheers" and symbol-display read as summary rather than a moment that narrows options or reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored adequately (deck, post-shutdown, Elio alone). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (confusion reframed as compass), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeit or visible price paid for choosing the left-right-up path. The grandmother's "glimpse" complicates but does not causally enable the final descent; Elio's shift from hesitation to trust occurs through epiphany rather than pressure-driven choice. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with thematic reweighting, yet the final image (golden light, ready quill) feels more like promise than reconfiguration with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph. The causal lens is signaled (swap pieces to amend imbalance) but the stakes remain abstract—"reality itself" and "cloud-city" collapse are declared but never test Kael's options with a visible tradeoff on the page. The swapping proceeds without meaningful resistance or narrowing; the groaning and shaking complicate atmospherically but do not force a tactical shift. Closure (sky clears, weight lifts) lands as Decisive Change but the cost is conceptual only, not felt in a forfeited path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who and where within the first paragraph (Elara, whispering gallery) and teaches a lens by the third night when the king topples and pieces reconfigure, suggesting Accumulative/Textural mode. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara unbound the board and herself, leaving with new understanding. However, the cost is more asserted than shown—no on-page forfeiture or tactical price is legible in the final image, weakening the closure's felt weight. The interregnum framing promises liminal opportunity but doesn't materially constrain her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and motifs (stone, feather, mercury skin) accrue until the cavern sequence. Orientation anchors (bookstore, Lirael, stone) arrive quickly. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael integrates the stone's shards, declares home is "the act of remembering"—but the cost is abstract; obsidian flecks and a glow are asserted consequences without foreclosing a legible path or tactical shift. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("to seed the world with truth") tells rather than charges the image, weakening the RR.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Alaric decodes threads → memory surfaces → hidden path revealed → pedestal glows → village unfreezes. However, the closure's cost is abstract—"weight on his chest lifting" and walking away feel like relief without visible forfeiture or a path foreclosed with felt price. The final image (tapestry whole, village reborn) reconfigures the premise but the cost remains conceptual rather than undeniable on the page, limiting Resonant Reconfiguration strength.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (canyon, bone towers, Kael's studio) arrive early and remain stable. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (nightshade ink, pale spire, light scattering) and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost. However, causality is loose—the ink's glow and the spire's shimmer feel like authorial fiat rather than motivated by prior rules or Kael's tactical choice. The closure moment (light fading, canyon sighing, "finally learned how to see") gestures toward Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is oblique: we're told the elders will call him heretic tomorrow, yet the present consequence is a soft epiphany without visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (workshop on acid sea, Lira at workbench with statue) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (charm, pockmarks, quilts, kintsugi) layer toward a conceptual repricing at closure where the protagonist grasps that "the charm isn't a key, it's a promise" and kintsugi means "surviving." Cost is asserted ("tell it loud," respirator removal) but the consequence remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or altered tactic follows the inhalation of fumes. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant) but the felt cost is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (reflection-led, recurring images, pattern reprise). Orientation is clean. The closure unit—placing the drawing beside the pool and carrying the cavern's peace—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of fractures), but the cost is asserted ("weight of decades lifting") rather than shown through a forfeited option or dramatized price. The vision of his mother and the phrase "temporary eternity" recur but do not narrow tactics or alter knowledge in a way that changes his stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (Elara, lighthouse, dawn post-heatwave) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's whispered intent reaches the village, proving her theory with felt emotional cost (tears, vulnerability). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent, hum, and vibration build density until the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thalos validates her method, narrowing her isolation into shared knowledge. The fisherman/wife beat offers closure participation, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that alters their options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through ritualistic actions and cryptic instructions toward a final resonant moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—voices singing, the reverse migration begun—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: what did Mara forfeit or endure to achieve this? The antenna-building sequence deepens pressure through repetition, yet the final certainty ("for the first time in years, she felt certain") softens the stakes rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when by ~100 words). The closure—"We occlude... with truth"—reads as a declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost; the ledger's discovery and Mara's plan are told, not dramatized into a choice that forecloses options. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat substitutes thematic assertion for a visible consequence or renunciation. Cost is conceptual at best and not made undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is swift (who/where/when by the second sentence). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: the boutonnière clue → woman → hatch → trunk → journal forms a because/therefore chain, but the final beat—Elias's promise to "return them"—lacks on-page mechanics or visible cost; we don't see him begin the work or forfeit anything concrete to earn the closure image. The "borrowed memories" mechanism is told in summary ("a forbidden art") rather than dramatized through choice or constraint. The dawn-lift mist and "hope" tag feel like a thematic overlay rather than a pressure reconfiguration with felt consequence, landing closer to Resonant Reconfiguration but undercharging the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers a Hybrid lens (causal journey layered with accumulative symbolic resonance), but the closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration without clear cost. The doorway vision and father's line reweight Lila's self-perception, yet no on-page action forecloses an option or exacts a price—she simply returns home with the chip and a smile. The spiral/ant/creek linkage provides motivated ellipsis through the discovery beats, but the ending relies on assertion ("The lingering promise had been kept") rather than a felt before/after. Orientation anchors early and cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: the queen climbs to confront the dream source, and the grotto figure forces stance crystallization. Closure form is Charged Poise—she understands the bleeding starlight mirrors her own fear and turns back—but the cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page (no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical shift). Orientation is clean by ~60 words. The figure's monologue delivers the turn rather than protagonist agency, which weakens causality at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where quickly; the drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative dressing (shell → ledger → realization → engine success). The closure unit—Elara aligning the shell atop the engine and achieving resonance—lands on the page, but the conceptual cost ("by returning differently") is asserted in dialogue and theme rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. The ledger's arrival feels convenient: Jorin produces it mid-scene without prior setup, and its "palette of resolve" phrase is echoed verbatim by Elara's epiphany, flattening causality into prompt fulfillment. One meaningful tightening occurs (the realization that she must let the shell guide rather than force), but the stakes-test remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives promptly (mountain cabin, grave, Elias, present tense). The structure is causal in skeleton—grave leads to scroll, scroll to climb, climb to pedestal—but linkage reads more as mysterious discovery than because/therefore pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the jealousy fades into "strange, bittersweet clarity" and the realization "I wasn't trapped in the past; I was building it." However, the cost is conceptual and abstract; no on-page action, forfeiture, or reweighted image makes the price undeniable. The final paragraph tells the shift rather than showing a choice or image that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (shop, fog, protagonist role). The closure unit—Lira writes the note connecting screw to Eleanor—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the screw's meaning. Cost is conceptual (unveiling another's redemption) but felt faintly rather than unmistakably on the page. The final paragraph's summary ("unveiled an ordinary miracle") tells the reconfiguration instead of letting the image hold it, blunting closure charge. One meaningful deepening occurs (engraving discovery → photo match), meeting length requirements, but the resolution hinges on off-page material (Mrs. Voss's reaction is deferred).

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid: Kael's preparation and invocation directly cause the rune to crystallize, then flare, reshaping his scars and opening a path. Orientation anchors (floating platform, moss forest, obsidian cups, crow quill) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—scars becoming legible symbols, platform steadying, path revealed—lands on the page with a visible shift in options (he descends into the forest). Cost is implied (he has shed hesitation, committed to the rune's power) but not sharply foregrounded as a loss or sacrifice in the final beat; the ending reads more as triumph than trade-off, softening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (causal setup with accumulative/textural closure through the charged musical performance). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure—Elias finishing the song to release the resonance—lands on the page with a visible cost (the bottle emptied, the chainsaws resume), but the causal link between the perfume drop and the sister's voice feels introduced rather than set up, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with felt cost. The Witness moves from seeking truth to "profound peace" via vision rather than causal linkage or stakes-driven choice. Orientation debt is heavy: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (the Witness is a title, not a name; the temple's relationship to any world is unclear). The ending declares understanding achieved but offers no on-page reversal, renunciation, or price paid. Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal progression nor accumulative density creates meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph and maintains single POV throughout. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that clocks measure longing reweights the entire premise, with the cost legible in Lorn's return to the station knowing this truth yet unable to share it. The accumulative lens holds—counting backwards structures the escalation, and the fjord clock's revelation pays off the station's hydraulic mechanisms introduced early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fjord parts, shifting from observation to metaphysical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Hybrid-Accumulative: chalk outline → staircase → subway car → metaphysical journey → return. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("Contradictions aren't traps. They're mirrors") but the cost is unclear—Clara ends where she began emotionally, now planning to visit her father, a decision that feels like delayed action rather than a reweighting with on-page consequence. The subway-car journey and instant return to the library collapse causality; no dramatized choice narrows options or forecloses a path. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (library, Clara, midsummer) so no penalty applied there, but the metaphysical transit lacks legible stakes or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when emerge gradually across the first ~200 words without deliberate pattern-teaching, harming comprehension (−0.4). No on-page closure unit; Mara ends where she began—tomorrow she'll "start again"—without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The piece cycles through vignettes (David/Elise, crying child, teen/poet, man/clown) in accumulative mode but never tightens options or reweights the premise with undeniable pressure at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates through repeated motifs (covenant, small moments, walnut ink, the photo) and a single cadence shift at the end when Elara realizes "the covenant's weight...was in the now." This is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that reweights the premise), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical change results from her realization. The ending smile and confident departure lack friction, making the conceptual price implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece attempts a Hybrid lens—Causal setup (moon rock as catalyst) blending into Accumulative/Textural closure (the station "lighter," ivy "less suffocating")—but the conductor's speech resolves the conflict through explanation rather than on-page cost or action. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing ("loneliness is a language"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift anchors the repricing. The rumor-chain method is mentioned but never dramatized as a constraint or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (forest frequencies, ring translations, melody as guide) and holds it through the ending. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias reaches the stillpoint and his mother speaks—"the place where feeling becomes seeing"—but the cost remains abstract and the transformation feels asserted rather than earned by prior choices that foreclosed other paths. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The because/therefore linkage from ring vibrations → river → map → stillpoint reads coherent, but the final beat introduces the mother as flesh without prior dramatization of what was risked or lost to reach her.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from fixer to witness, forgoing control with a visible cost (walking away from the anomaly's certainty to face the farmer). The drive lens reads Causal, and the holographic projection provides a motivated ellipsis that changes knowledge. The ending offers Charged Poise—he commits to apology and listening, and "the girl's fever broke" signals consequence. However, the key reversal ("Trust the web") is handed to Elias by Lira rather than earned through his own on-page struggle, softening the closure's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors establish harbor, moonlight, and Kael's presence quickly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Kael's solo mapping → Lira's arrival and collaboration → crowd gathering → dawn reflection. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence spoken, world listened), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. The final "twinge of sadness" and "small smile" gesture toward felt cost without grounding it in a concrete choice or loss that alters Kael's options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and why she's at this archive remain unclear past 120 words, costing −0.4. The closure—grandmother's face appearing and Mara accepting her role as "gardener"—reads as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than legible (what path has she foreclosed?). The lens wavers between causal (finding clues) and accumulative (adding art), never fully cohering. Applying Orientation Test penalty and lens drift: cap all categories at 8.3, Q3 at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, with no clear temporal anchor or spatial grounding beyond abstract labels. POV collapse at "my chest ache" and the sudden appearance of "She" without prior setup breaks causality. The ending's closure unit—drumming together until "the garden itself seemed to sing"—relies on atmospherics rather than a decisive change or visible cost. The drive lens oscillates between Accumulative (layered images) and Causal without teaching a coherent pattern or holding through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and establishes a causal drive lens: storm → challenge → Elias uses silence and the zodiac coin → finds the key and chamber → emerges victorious. The closure lands on-page with Elias's realization and the whispered tune, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The discovered chamber of maps hints at surveillance but does not alter his tactics or force a trade-off in the ending beat. One meaningful tightening (the key/Libra discovery) narrows the path, but the final image recharges theme more than it reconfigures stakes with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed (who she is and why she's here remain vague past the opening paragraphs) but not taught as a pattern. No on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; Lira arrives, performs her light-weaving, and departs with the dock "a little less heavy"—a declared outcome rather than a visible before/after with felt cost. The piece reads as a single illustrative action without escalation or a causal turn that narrows options. Accumulative lens is plausible, but the ending offers only authorial assertion ("its darkness a little less heavy") rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story opens with heavy atmospheric phrasing ("the hush where past meets prophecy lingered like a breath held too long") that delays orientation; who/where/when anchor by ~200 words, past the 120-word test, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure. The dominant stake—Lila's grief and isolation—tightens modestly through seven chess games, but the cost is summarized ("Lila lost them all") rather than shown in a single pivotal move. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Lila's resolve to "keep planting"), but the conceptual cost is asserted through dialogue ("Rebellions start small") rather than a decisive forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the closure lands via articulated agreement rather than cadence shift or pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present early (dock worker, island, sublittoral fringe), but the causal chain breaks at the climax: Lira "knew what she had to do" without prior setup, then releases the scrimshaw, which dissolves into light and triggers the island's disappearance via unexplained magic. The whale's role and the scrimshaw's mechanics are never established before they resolve the problem. The closure—island gone, Lira free—lacks felt cost; she laughs through tears with "the weight of the past finally lifted," a soft emotional reset. The lens wobbles between causal (her action triggers island collapse) and lyric reconfiguration, but neither lands with on-page price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (farmhouse, turbines, Lirael at table). The dominant stake—honoring grief through creation under the mandate—is signaled early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the whittling process accumulates density and the final spoon placement next to the bouquet offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she will continue carving despite the mandate). However, the mandate itself remains abstract backdrop with no on-page enforcement pressure or tactical constraint that tightens options; the cost of her defiance is implied rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or consequence within this scene. The closure image reweights prior material but the felt cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraph. However, the piece lacks a coherent drive lens: events accumulate as poetic descriptions rather than causal links or situational pressure, and the protagonist's "paraphrase" action produces magical effects (ice cracking, quartz glowing, standing on water) without resistance, cost, or a legible mechanism. The ending offers a Decisive Change in physical state (standing on liquid water) but the cost is invisible—Lirael experiences only exhilaration and "certainty," with no foreclosed option or visible price. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the closure lacks the required on-page cost that would make a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors within opening lines (courtyard, Elias, post-phoenix timeframe). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—motifs (cobalt dust, plants, fractals) layer toward a final image. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "I've just started to see" + painting phoenix-from-glass-bird, but cost is asserted ("his canvases would never be the same") rather than legible in the final image; no visible forfeiture or tactic shift. The cobalt-dust reveal and mural vision provide one meaningful deepening, but Marla's backstory arrives as convenience exposition rather than motivated ellipsis. Cost proof test fails: the ending declares transformation without showing what Elias sacrificed or lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (causal journey + accumulative resonance) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The cave discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Lira's understanding, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the pilgrimage wasn't over—it had just begun"). However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint appears on the page. The lens-dominant effect at closure is legible but the felt price is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Elias, observatory, post-loss timeframe) within the opening and holds a hybrid lens blending Accumulative (curtains ritual, origami accrual) and Causal (his nightly work leads to the pendant closure). The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reweights grief as "refracted—not diminished, but transformed" and the final inscription "Light the way" charges prior imagery. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he empties his pockets of origami, his hands bleed—but the price feels abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The closure lands but without sharp felt consequence, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who: Elara; where: skylight loft; when: post-crash). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Elara layers cards, tape measurements, and Mara's presence, building toward the final "rebuild" stance. However, closure lacks decisive cost—Mara's agreement to "bring others" and Elara's confident card-laying constitute promise rather than on-page transformation with felt price. The "rebuild" assertion reconfigures meaning conceptually but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is adequate: who (Lirael), where (archive/pagoda), and when (twilight) anchor by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering and the pagoda's glow. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lirael embraces the unknown and walks deeper—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically visible; we are told she "found her purpose" without a prior constraint she visibly forfeits. One meaningful deepening occurs (the pagoda's hum and light bath), meeting the 600–800 requirement, but the because/therefore linkage between the light and her final choice is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (dream-sharing causes hope to fray; comparing footage reveals the solution) but the closure beat relies on a late-revealed word "Bloom" that lacks causal groundwork—we don't see Lirael deduce or struggle toward it. The spiral symbol recurs but doesn't narrow options; Thalos provides both the second stone and the method, reducing protagonist agency at the decisive moment. Cost at closure is asserted ("gave it room to grow") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by ~80 words). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira's final stance ("compassion wasn't a liability") reweights her fractured sense of purpose, and the reconstructed tail serves as the charged image. However, the cost feels primarily emotional and reflective rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of shedding, reconstruction, and dawn imagery deepens the stake), held consistently, but the closure leans heavily on summary assertion ("she'd reclaimed the balance") rather than a final action or renunciation that makes the price undeniable without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with adequate spatial/temporal anchors (tower at dawn, post-surgery). The tunnel descent through coffee-ring portals provides a causal spine, but the hourglass shattering and Mara's return to the tower reads as convenient reset rather than earned closure—no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible in "her heart light for the first time in years." The closure effect (supposed Resonant Reconfiguration) lacks the undeniable pressure or felt sacrifice required; she gains insight without visible trade-off, violating the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara gathers sensory fragments (dust, film, crystal hum, lilac scent) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Mara, projection booth, night, rain). However, closure lacks visible cost: the crystal flares, lilacs appear, Mara smiles and descends "her steps light"—a tidy affirmation without foreclosing a path or reweighting prior material through sacrifice. The flashback to Elise and Thomas is causally inert in the present; it informs Mara's understanding but does not narrow her options or impose a price. The ending gesture (tucking the film strip, descending stairs) reads as setup for future action rather than a decisive change or charged poise on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit is a passive reception of stardust that grants creative fulfillment without protagonist agency; Kael tips a jar and images flood him, then the archway fades. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; the "unwritten calendar can wait" line asserts renewed purpose but nothing was visibly renounced or altered. The Drive Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (aurora motifs, stardust recursion), yet the final image does not reweight prior material—it simply restates the opening stance. Orientation is anchored early (aurora archway, Kael with sextant); no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens through the clock-repair quest but closure hinges on a sudden ability ("become occasionally everywhere") introduced by the woman without prior grounding. The final dream and spark-growth constitute a Decisive Change, but the cost is diffuse—what precisely did Kael forfeit or risk to achieve it? The archive's rules shift convenience; the woman's "wave function" explanation feels like a late rule-add rather than an earned mechanism. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph one), so no penalty there, but the causal spine wobbles at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening. The gear-in-socket turn triggers the forest transformation, but causality weakens when the hologram father delivers the solution rather than Elara earning it through prior pressure. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the gear becomes seed, machinery/nature coexist—but the cost is asserted ("pocket empty but mind full") rather than dramatized as a forfeited path. The lens wobbles between Causal (gear unlocks forest) and Accumulative (hum motif), settling Hybrid but not held cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ridgeway shifts scenery, travelers accumulate, the punch's star recurs, and closure arrives through a quiet reconfiguration when Lira leaves the punch on the stone and they return to vigil. Orientation is established early (ridgeway, dock, guides). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: waiting for the next leash), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing occurs on the page. The phrase "its work done" tells closure rather than showing a decisive image that reweights prior material with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Causal movement toward Conceptual Repricing): Elric's neglect causes Lady Veyra's scream, which triggers his philosophical realization and vocal choice. The closure lands on the page—Elric speaks, fixes the bolt, articulates a thematic insight—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; "his seraphically mundane existence now a beacon" is asserted rather than shown through foreclosed options. The staircase stain moment functions as discovery device but its mechanics (how a tonic stain maps to "unspoken pacts") lack clear causal logic, creating a minor motivation gap routed here.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, earning a −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—Veyra throws the pellet, the illusion dissolves, courtiers bow—lacks felt cost; she exits with the pellet still in hand and a smile, suffering no visible loss or alteration. The drive lens appears Causal but major turns occur off-stage (the pretender's usurpation, ancestors' encoding) and the ink pellet resolves a problem it did not help create. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, waiving the deduction. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost. Lira and Kael "descend into the storm" and sail toward a reef, but no concrete consequence, forfeiture, or reweighted stance appears—the final paragraphs assert healing and change without showing what was lost or altered. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (clues assembled, cyclical islands, bioluminescent spelling), but the ending delivers summary ("assembling a new world") instead of a charged image that reweights prior material with felt pressure. Cost proof test fails: no identifiable sentence shows a price paid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (spaceport, Lira, twilight). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—"the rebellion was a storm, gathering"—but the cost remains abstract; Lira smiles, the crowd roars, yet no tactical option was foreclosed, no visible price paid on the page. The hum's mechanics (receiver, alignment, signal) are asserted rather than tested under pressure, weakening causal links. The climax pivots on Jax calling "Now!" and Lira raising her arms; the reader cannot trace what alternative she rejected or what she risked in the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the opening lines). The piece follows a causal chain: kite discovery → plant telepathy reveals vault location → unsealing → placement in springs. However, the closure—Nana placing the sphere and deciding to tell the crews tomorrow—lacks visible cost on the page; her smile and light heart flatten the weight of implanting a destiny-encoded embryo. The drive lens reads Causal, but the final image grants consequence without friction, reducing the closure's felt price. One meaningful tightening occurs (the vault opens, stakes clarify), meeting minimum sufficiency but not charging the end.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (arboretum, Lila, post-bombing survivor). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory anchors (stone, lavender, salt) layer toward a final reweighting. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lila moves from freezing at Elias's image to tucking it away steadily—but cost is asserted ("her heart steady") rather than shown through a constraining choice or forfeited path. The "pearl of stillness" remains abstract; no single action forecloses an option with legible price. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors land by ~50 words), but closure cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with late situational pressure. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (library, lighthouse, portrait artist). The piece accumulates images—threads, tarot cards, portrait—but the closure remains murky: Elias arranges a web, the portrait "breathes," and he smiles. No decisive change or clear cost is visible; the ending reads as symbolic tableau rather than a reconfigured stake. The lens wavers between accumulative and causal without teaching the pattern early, and the final beat lacks the undeniable pressure required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and follows a causal chain: Lira decodes the drone, sees the tower hologram, speaks with the child, reaches the tower, and enters. However, the closure—stepping through the door—arrives without visible cost or a meaningful reconfiguration of prior material; it reads as a threshold rather than a decisive change or resonant repricing. The inferred lens is loosely Causal, but the final beat does not narrow options or foreclose a path with felt consequence, landing closer to a narrative comma than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads as Causal: Lirael's decision to activate the chamber triggers Kael's awakening and sets revolution in motion. However, the closure beat—their silent pact and the revolution's beginning—asserts consequence rather than dramatizing a felt cost on the page. The final image tells us "the revolution began" without showing what Lirael or Kael forfeit or risk in that exact moment. One meaningful tightening occurs (chamber activation), but the ending relies on declaration ("there was no going back") rather than a visible, irreversible act or realization that reconfigures their options.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece lacks on-page escalation: Lira digs, hums, and walks rows without a tightening choice or reversal. The sandstorm mentioned in the distance never complicates her actions. "Quiet" is declared as thematic anchor but does not constrain a single tactic. The ending whispers "Quiet" and presses the dome, yet no felt or visible cost lands—no path is foreclosed, no option reweighted. The orientation is clear early, but the accumulative lens never delivers a decisive pressure point or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—capturing the goddess's echo to understand the constellations—is signaled early. However, the closure unit is ambiguous: the goddess dissolves, constellations stabilize, and Kael smiles at a lingering note, but no decisive change in his options or knowledge is dramatized on the page. The "cost" (goddess gone) is asserted rather than felt through a concrete trade-off or foreclosed path. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the final image reweights atmosphere more than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (the observatory/nib motif). Orientation anchors (Clara, observatory, post-midnight call) arrive cleanly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara resumes work with the nib now in a fountain pen, writing op-eds and testifying—she's crystallized her stance with visible cost (family rupture, public censure). The causal chain from journalist's call → archival investigation → exposure → ongoing atonement holds, though the middle section (overnight research montage) compresses discovery without meaningful resistance or false leads. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds her father's handwritten note, which narrows options and drives the exposure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.9)
    Orientation is delayed—"laboratory of lost sounds" anchors setting but not spatial or temporal stakes until Elara's exposition past the first third. The closure (letters quiet the cries, amber fades, lab silent) lands on the page but the causal chain is stitched by convenience: the amber pulses when needed, the letters are already stacked and ready, and the nursery materializes without prior setup. The firmware's "memory labyrinth" and Althea's disembodied voice function as expedient devices rather than causally motivated elements. Lens reads as attempted Causal but expedience undercuts linkage; cost (guilt dissolving) is asserted, not dramatized with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-discovery and density increase reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored early (grotto, mist, Mara), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mara's realization ("It's a language") and the bell tolling feel like conceptual arrival without foreclosing a live option or imposing a felt price on the page. The sand mandala's shift and holographic vortex read as spectacle rather than a trade-off that alters her stance with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tessera-placement ritual accumulates symbolic weight rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image reweights the plaza and Elias's resolve—but the cost remains abstract ("promise forward," "warm coldness") rather than felt on the page in a specific forfeiture or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias fits the tessera into the stepping stone, but no prior choice narrows his options; the act is uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias hums, echoes gather, spirits join, timeline mends. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden glows, coin blanks, Elias fades to applause)—but cost remains asserted rather than embodied. The tarot coin's reversal and blank surface are told transformations without on-page friction or a legible trade-off that the reader can point to in a specific sentence. The fractured-timeline premise frames the problem yet never narrows Elias's options or forces a tactical pivot; he simply performs harder and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: Elias's shock unlocks markers → he maps them with the geode → alignment occurs. One meaningful tightening appears when the geode "flared" and synced, but that moment lacks visible cost or a second-order complication; it resolves smoothly into affirmation. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (he moves from theory to demonstration), yet the cost is conceptual at best—no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the phrase "let's show the world" defers consequence rather than landing it here.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with Lira as sole on-page character, meeting Track A defaults. The closure unit—Lira's realization and walk toward dawn—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical shift demonstrated. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase via the fossil's emotional journey and spore absorption), yet the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material; it asserts transformation without demonstrable pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, but causality is thin: Mara seeks the jar, finds it easily, hears its message, and accepts it without complication. The ending offers no decisive change—she already believed prophecies were malleable, and the canyon's echo merely confirms this. Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure at closure; here the final image (cataloging buttons again) reads as static reprise without reweighting prior stakes or visible cost. The lens appears Accumulative but does not deepen or shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bluff visit deepens Mara's resolve through layered memory and ritual transcription. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the courage to seek it" crystallizes her stance with felt cost (acknowledging buried fears). However, the weather station coordinates and transcription ritual feel ornamental rather than causally essential—the story could close identically without them, weakening the cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit—no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs. Thaddeus boards the ferry, crosses, disembarks, and carries forward "his own layer" in pure stasis without visible cost or altered options. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain unclear until well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never tightens or reweights the dominant stake on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: visions and sensory intensifications accumulate toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (Mara, wasteland, abandoned oasis) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara understands the oasis's nature and carries the lesson forward—but the cost remains abstract; the story does not show what she forfeits or what path she forecloses by leaving. The vision of her younger self planting sunflowers is a late reveal that reconfigures the premise, yet it bypasses on-page causal work: we never see her wrestle with this memory or make a choice that this knowledge alters. The ending "her work here was done" asserts completion without dramatizing a visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows a causal sequence: Elias decides to visit Mara, brings the gauge, she hesitates then accepts, window opens. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mara "let[s] the light in" without on-page forfeit or visible change in her circumstances beyond the symbolic gesture. The Decisive Change is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete action that narrows her options. Under a Causal lens, the linkage is present but the cost at closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Lirael), where (tidal library), and when (after reincarnation memory) within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum crescendos, images coalesce, and the library transforms in response to Lirael's stance. Closure arrives as Charged Poise when she begins writing again after placing *Brittle Awakenings* on the shelf, reweighting her from "contemporary of the dead" to "pioneer of the living." However, the felt cost is oblique—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible; the transformation happens through environmental response rather than protagonist sacrifice, weakening the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral motif, Elara's guidance, and the public art installation layer toward a thematic deepening rather than a causal chain of because/therefore beats. Closure (Lila's resolve to "encourage them to speak their truths aloud" and write a letter of her own) functions as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture of income, client, or relationship that would make the "before/after" tangible. The threshold RR test is met, yet the cost proof remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal (Lila's subsonic-frequency gambit → trickster response → community shift), and the closure attempt—"she'd be ready"—lands as Charged Poise with the tricksters' note signaling ongoing stakes. However, the cost remains abstract: the board reverses funding and arguments soften off-page, but no visible price (lost relationship, sacrifice, or foreclosed path) is paid on the page to make the "first move" weighty. The voice's late intrusion ("*You think you've won*") introduces new stakes rather than reweighting prior material, diluting closure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes who/where/when within opening lines (waiving orientation penalty). Drive lens reads Causal but linkage weakens: the compass spins wildly, then inexplicably "stills" when jabbed into a wall, delivering the key without clear because/therefore logic. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("prison" becomes "gateway") but the cost is asserted rather than felt—Elias walks forward with the same stance he held at the start, and no option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with light Accumulative texture. Orientation is clean (quarry, mist, Clara's purpose established early). The handprint discovery and locket emergence follow because/therefore logic, but both arrive via Voss's investigation rather than Clara's agency reshaping tactics. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the portrait complete, empathy "awakened"), yet the cost remains conceptual and asserted: framing the ribbon feels commemorative rather than foreclosing a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative overlay—Clara's investigation follows because/therefore links through archive discovery to roof action. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost: Clara reads the stanza and the nail warms, but no decisive change, renunciation, or felt consequence appears on the page. The final line "some truths were worth the risk" tells theme rather than showing a before/after with cost, landing closer to Charged Poise without the pressure to make the poise undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (pullout context arrives late, hitchhiker backstory interrupts present anchor). The closure—Elias transported to meet Marisol—lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The drive lens (attempted Causal) breaks when the flake's "map" function and the fiddle's reality-bending power are asserted without prior limitation or trade-off, making the ending feel like a switch-flip rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece signals a hybrid lens (reflective accumulation leading to a conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation is clear early. The closure—Elias finding peace and "breaking the cycle" via symbols—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: renunciation of force), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; his calm is never tested by direct confrontation or failure. The startup collapse happens off-page and Marcus's restlessness is summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs (realization that choices, not fate, drive cycles), meeting the minimum for this length, but the final image restates the theme rather than charging prior material with new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece attempts a causal arc (telegram → Veyra's arrival → hologram entry → temple revelation), but the central mechanics—how variable stars decode inscriptions, why Lirael's dual-realm witnessing matters—remain abstract. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing ("map of empathy"), yet the cost is told ("a tide finding its shore") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeited option or tactical sacrifice. The temple's self-rewriting and the brother's fate resolve through exposition in the final paragraphs without on-page pressure testing Lirael's choice to "carry others' weights."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (druid, vortex, post-ritual failure) and the piece holds a Hybrid lens (Causal setup → Accumulative/lyric payoff via spore-vision). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts her buried violence and the vortex calms, reweighting her self-image. However, the causal spine is thin—seed release and spore inhalation happen without resistance or cost that narrows options; the "vision solidified" and "vortex began to slow" arrive as gift rather than trade. The transition from action (stepping in, releasing seed) to resolution (spores clarify, vortex stills) lacks a because/therefore hinge where Mira's choice drives the outcome. Cost is felt emotionally ("guilt had lingered, poisoning her") but not dramatized as a present forfeiture or tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the maze clipping, scars, visions, and golden-eyed figure layer toward the final convergence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("The intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice"), but the cost remains abstract—her scars become "faint, glowing lines" without a felt price, and the covenant's repair happens in a single gesture ("pressed it to her heart, and the labyrinth shuddered"). Orientation is anchored early (cobalt glade, Lirael, dusk), but the mechanics of the eclipsed covenant and the future's early arrival are asserted rather than causally earned, leaving the final image more proclaimed than proven.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchard, needle-thread ritual, and fruit-eating layer toward a reconfiguration. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the patchwork soul holds firm), but the cost is abstract—no concrete path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The keeper guides every beat, reducing protagonist agency at key turns. Orientation is clear early (catacomb orchard, Lirael, bartering purpose).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes Lenny, the trailer, and the cloth within the first fifth. Drive lens reads as Causal: cloth discovery → research → phone call → purpose shift. The closure unit—Lenny's realization about resurrecting stories—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than visible; no prior option is foreclosed, and the bassist's confirmation arrives as convenience rather than complication. The phone call functions as resolution-by-conversation, undermining earned escalation. Orientation is clean; one meaningful turn (research reveals *Echo Valley*) tightens knowledge, but the ending pivot lacks felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the seed's light triggers the arbor's transformation, which deepens in the final paragraphs when roots shift and the sapling sways. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatized—Elara "finds her place" and maps the next analogy without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. The closing image reweights prior material but the felt cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words; "after tomorrow disappeared" is atmospheric but non-anchoring, and the atrium's physical reality never grounds. The woman's transformation sequence has no causal linkage—she plunges, then emerges changed without on-page agency or visible cost that narrows options. The child's arrival at the end is a soft reset that deflates rather than charges closure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the librarian's role remains static observation rather than driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story opens with atmospheric description but withholds "who" until deep into paragraph one and "when/why" remain vague throughout. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening occurs—Elias simply places the pearl and the lattice activates without resistance or trade-off. The closure effect (walls thinning, doors opening) happens to others off-page; Elias himself undergoes no decisive change or visible cost. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies: spatial anchors ("heart of the caves," "chamber," "spiral") float without cumulative specificity, and the "years later" epilogue breaks the scene window without paying off the initial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara transcribes graffiti, each message deepening her understanding until she draws her own heart-map and plays the accordion with "raw solace." The final chalk word "Begin" offers a conceptual repricing, but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a live option. The turn from seeking answers to "articulating pain" is told rather than earned through a decision that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs at closure—Lira finds the library and smiles, but no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes under pressure, and no felt price is paid. The story reads as arrival-at-goal rather than transformation or earned stasis. Drive lens appears Causal (she follows clues, measures delays, pulls a book), but the final beat offers discovery without cost, failing the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and pursues an accumulative lens: Lira contemplates usurping the throne via the violin's reality-fracturing music, weighs two futures (crown vs. garden), and dismantles the dream. The closure unit reads as Earned Stasis—she refuses the throne, the violin shatters—but the reversal from "propagate" (empire path) to dismantle lacks a clear because/therefore turn; the plants' warnings and the violin's string-snaps feel atmospheric rather than causal triggers. Cost is present (the mulberry ache remains) but the tightening is conceptual rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—sealing the cracks and preserving the echo—lands on the page, but the cost is unclear: does the lullaby or moonlight painting exact a price, or does competence simply win? The reversal (pool cracking) arrives and resolves within two paragraphs without altering Lirael's options or forcing a trade-off. Under a Causal lens, the "embellish" solution feels convenient rather than motivated by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers symbolic weight (shell, hairpin, tree perch) toward a thematic reweighting rather than causal escalation. Orientation is clear early. The closure unit—Lirael's realization that contentment is "a practice" and the peaceable final image—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible path is foreclosed on the page, and Elara's hairpin return arrives by off-page merchant guilt rather than protagonist agency. The midpoint "how?" beat offers a micro-turn but doesn't tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (Accumulative texture in the cloak/mirror/chime imagery + Causal choice at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. The piece attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Mira crystallizes her interpretation via chime removal), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical consequence lands on the page. The final image ("ghost of laughter" in the mirror) gestures at transformation without demonstrating what Mira has given up or how her options have narrowed. Escalation via the cloak is embodied, but the wind-chime resolution arrives without prior setup that those specific woods represented competing truths.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation debt persists past 120 words—"floating rock meditation platform" and "magnetic grotto" hover without spatial anchors or grounding who/where/when until the apprentice appears mid-story. The closure unit (Lira's "becoming" insight) attempts Conceptual Repricing but the cost is absent: no visible forfeiture, altered tactic, or foreclosed path on the page. The stone-throwing recurs but doesn't tighten options; weeks pass in summary without escalating pressure or on-page stakes crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure unit is a realization ("understood") followed by a descriptive walk the next morning. Cost is asserted ("journey just beginning") but not dramatized—no option is foreclosed, no tactics altered on the page. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens through layered imagery (echoes, dust, birds) but the final image ("The pulse was with him") restates theme without reweighting prior material through a decisive action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening and follows a causal sequence: mist walking grants entry, pouring starlight opens the keystone, the garden transforms to match the sketch. Closure is a Decisive Change—the spire's garden becomes his mother's garden—but the cost is elided; Kael sacrifices nothing on the page and gains a skill and a sacred memory without forfeiture. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative touches (the "lingering luminance" motif), but the reversal (ice melting, sanctuary appearing) arrives via convenience rather than a protagonist trade-off, weakening the felt price at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when he pours the vial, yet the stakes never narrow options in a way that foreclosed another path.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric imagery and reflective deepening that culminates in the library discovery. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elias accepts his grief and no longer fears the dark), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—he places the key tag down and walks away, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed. The water parting "like a cathedral" and his steady flame at the end supply resonance, but the decisive shift lacks the sharp before/after that would elevate the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The dominant stake—deciphering the backwards prophecy to understand the universe's purpose—is signaled, and there is one meaningful tightening when Kael realizes the prophecy is "a mirror, reflecting the universe's desire to harmonize." However, the cost of this realization is asserted rather than dramatized: the text claims his doubt is "gone" and he is "ready," but no prior path is foreclosed with visible consequence. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (alignment achieved), yet the felt price remains vague—what did Kael lose or sacrifice to reach this state?

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elias moves from seeking solace to crystallizing echoes through scattered light, accumulating sensory density until the monsters dissolve. However, the closure unit—monsters vanishing into mist, page gaining "weight," Elias descending—registers as description rather than a decisive on-page change with legible cost. The final paragraph tells us he's "ready" and that his heart "beat with a distant intimacy," but no prior option is foreclosed and no visible price paid on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where Elias loses, renounces, or forecloses something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (sapphire viaduct, Elias, broken bell). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias's calculations and adjustments narrow options until the drip synchronizes and the rift stitches. Closure lands on-page with a visible outcome (bell working, rift balanced), though the cost reads as exhaustion and fragility rather than a decisive forfeiture. The "last fish caught" coincides with success, reading as atmospheric rather than causally earned, which slightly softens the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mara's discovery of the label triggers investigation, the photographs serve as both physical trail and emotional map, and the encounter with Elias's daughter provides the reweighting. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara places her own photo and commits to shared remembering, crystallizing a stance shift from solitary guardian to collaborative witness. Cost is felt (she relinquishes private ownership of memory) but could be more viscerally legible on the page. The orientation is clear and the structure (single scene with flashback fragments) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words and follows a single continuous scene, but the closure unit lacks legible cost. Elara traces patterns, writes a formula, and smiles—no option is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no price paid on the page. The final paragraph offers sentiment ("she allowed herself to feel") but no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material with visible consequence. The accumulative lens is suggested by the pattern-tracing structure, but the ending does not tighten or deepen with cost; it diffuses into reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, nocturnal arbor, post-static timeframe) land within the first 100 words. Drive lens reads as Causal: buckle → node pulse → pattern repair → next node, a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Kael accepts the perpetual watcher role with the cost of solitude and endless vigilance made legible in "the watcher's work was never done." One meaningful tightening occurs (first node success reveals a second disrupted node deeper in). Cost is present but muted; the smile and safety declaration soften the price rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Kael merging energies with the brain, destroying the clone, and descending with the jar—reads as a Decisive Change, but the causal chain is murky: why does channeling "complementary opposites" into the jar destroy only the clone and leave Kael intact? The mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, and the brain's role as "catalyst" is told without prior setup. The inferred lens is Causal, but the because/therefore linkage breaks at the climax, leaving the resolution feeling convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Marlowe works the leaf blower, sings lullabies, and the echoes respond in escalating intensity until the climactic burst of light restores laughter. Orientation is prompt (tunnel, Marlowe, leaf blower by paragraph two). However, the closure—"He had done it"—is declared rather than dramatized through a decisive action or image that reweights prior stakes; the "burst of light" and "thousand tiny voices" arrive as external validation without visible cost or trade-off that forecloses a live option. The ending confirms success but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure or felt consequence beyond Marlowe's tears.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Hybrid-Causal: Mara waits, the cultist arrives, she tosses the pendant (narrowing options), then steps onto the moss path to closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (frozen garden, Mara, liminal hour). The toss-and-step sequence functions as Decisive Change with visible cost (cultist's scream, Mara's departure from this reality), but causality frays: why does discarding the pendant open the door when the cultist demanded she give it to him? The pendant's mechanics—how it gates the library—remain unclear, so the climactic act reads more symbolic than motivated. The closure image (mentor with lantern, "you interiorized the exterior") lands with conceptual charge, but the cost proof is oblique; Mara's homesickness resolves too cleanly without on-page friction or trade-off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—crozier fused, nexus blooming, Kael freed—lands on the page as Decisive Change with visible cost (scarred hands, frayed mind). The drive lens reads Causal: Kael's successive approximation attempts narrow options until self-sacrifice becomes the only path. However, the "penny drops" twice without clear differentiation in what changes between realizations, creating minor lens ambiguity at midpoint before stabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is named at line one but his mission and the hush concept require multiple paragraphs to clarify stakes. The drive lens wavers between causal (he tunes/dismantles to unlock the hush) and accumulative-textural (lyric images of transformation). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the tower reborn—but the cost is invisible: Kael pays no price, loses nothing, and the fragment simply goes inert without consequence to him. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; anchors unclear past ~120 words and no disorientation pattern taught.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern-driven ferry dissolution). The closure—ferry dissolves, passengers merge, hourglass shatters—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is abstract: Kael loses the ferry and stands "alone," yet his final smile and deeper walk suggest no felt forfeit. The hourglass's sand "spilling outward to weave the timelines" functions as telling rather than dramatized causality, and the resolution feels authored rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (gallery, Clara, sinew thread). The eruption beat offers a micro-turn, but causality is decorative: the thread "responds" and "materializes" a door without Clara's choice driving the change—magic solves what it created. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she gains "courage to weave"), but the cost is asserted ("unsettling, yet peaceful") rather than shown as a foreclosed path or visible trade-off. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the pattern holds, but the final reconfiguration lacks felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established early (benthic city, instructor role, post-alien discovery). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael feeling "purpose settle over her"—but the cost is asserted ("learning to navigate by starlight herself") rather than dramatized through a concrete choice or forfeiture on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (alien constellations, edge geometry motifs recur), yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible consequence; the ending restates the opening premise without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes Lila's task and the photograph clue early, but escalation relies on convenient discoveries (identical hearing aid in cobwebs, woman waiting at fountain) rather than causally linked reversals. The man's ghost appearance and message delivery constitute a decisive change, but the cost—what Lila forfeits or risks to achieve it—remains abstract; the stakes never narrow her options on the page. The atrium's west wing journey functions as spatial transit rather than pressure sequence. Closure arrives through fulfillment of the stated job rather than transformation under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a single meaningful tightening (tide turning forces action). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure—finding her brother's preserved signal—constitutes a Decisive Change that reweights Lira's understanding, though the cost (emerging into salt-stung cheeks, codex clutched) feels more atmospheric than deeply felt. The because/therefore chain from codex discovery → gold fleck activation → holographic map → brother's signal holds cleanly, and the rising water supplies genuine pressure that narrows her window. One minor causality slip: the machines "somehow" still have power, a convenience that enables the climax without earned setup.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors emerge slowly—"opal observatory under snow" and "Elias Voss" appear early, but the causal chain linking the death-certificate error, the woman's apartment artifacts, and the current defragmentation remains murky until late. The closure gesture ("I hear the future... it's mine") and the digital ghost as guide offer a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; we don't see what Elias forecloses or pays. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (ink patterns, heartbeat count, porcelain shard recurrence), yet the final image restates the premise without a decisive reweighting or cadence shift that makes the before/after felt. Orientation debt is mild but present; applying −0.3 here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Charged Poise: the storyteller releases the diamond and the canyon falls silent, crystallizing her stance against oblivion. However, cost is abstract—she retains the "diamond's song" in her mind, softening the loss. Orientation is established by ~100 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (hum weaves echoes, diamond pulses, towers vibrate), but the final beat shifts to a declared realization rather than sustained texture, weakening coherence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the echoes roar back, but the resolution feels convenience-eased.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece moves through infiltration → phone confessions → metamorphosis → return, but causality weakens at the climax: the arrowhead "flares" and garden "spins" without clear because/therefore linkage to Elara's choice. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she returns transformed), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"light it felt" is herbalist's claim, not Elara's embodied loss. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The inferred lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid; the ending leans situational but the prior beats promise causal agency that doesn't fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt at closure. Orientation anchors (enchanted orchard, sky-bridge, Lira) land within the first 120 words. The escalation sequence—crack noticed, music played, peaches fall, geyser erupts, statues crumble—reads more as causal dominoes than accumulative deepening; the orchard's transformation feels externally triggered rather than earned by Lira's sustained pressure. Closure unit: "breaking free wasn't about destruction… about trusting the chaos" is thesis-stated rather than image-delivered, and the "orchard listened… it answered" ends on assertion without legible cost on the page (the snapped string was already replaced by the shell, no tactical shift followed).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm-in-bottle → release → machines revive → brittle hush becomes promise. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is, where the border sits, what "disputed territory mailman" means—emerges gradually but becomes clear by the arcade paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush shifts from threat to promise), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture, no visible price paid by Elias, only the claim that "something" changed. Escalation is a single tightening (release of storm) rather than multiple reversals, which fits the length, but the final reconfiguration lacks an unmistakable on-page cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors setting and character early and follows a clear spatial progression. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost: Elio arrives seeking beauty in quiet, finds it, and departs unchanged with his belief confirmed rather than tested. The halo fragment warms and glows but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image reweights prior material only weakly; under Causal, no meaningful tightening narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a contemplative accumulative lens through Eleanor's catalog of sensory details and metaphors, but the closure—floating manuscripts in a circular room—arrives as a convenient payoff rather than a reconfiguration built from prior pressure. The scarf's whisper "Continue" offers poise but the cost remains abstract; no tangible path is foreclosed on the page. The midnight sequence introduces new rules (mirrors, floating papers) without prior constraint or friction, weakening causal coherence even under an accumulative reading.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (within tolerance). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and diction accumulate toward a pattern-break when the dream materializes. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the dream was always hers), but cost is asserted rather than shown—no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The final paragraph tells us "she no longer needed to paint" without dramatizing the renunciation or its price. One meaningful deepening occurs (the light pools oddly, colors refuse to blend), but the resolution bypasses agency.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Orientation Test is not met: who/where/when anchors remain vague past 120 words ("shadowed nexus," "cosmic possibility" offered as setting without spatial grounding), triggering −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit (mist dissolving, voice echoing, new location) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract ("weight of enveloped secrets") rather than a legible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The lens wavers between Causal (lock mechanism) and lyric accumulation without teaching the pattern early. Elias's agency at closure is passive observation, not a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and why this morning matters emerge slowly across the first 200 words. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the locket as bridge, memories "misplaced" not gone), but the cost is asserted rather than felt: what does Elias lose or foreclose by staying? The causal chain from fairy ring to sextant to constellations to locket relies on symbolic alignment rather than because/therefore pressure. Clara's voice and the silver light function as reward without dramatized trade-off, and the piece ends on waiting—a pose without the charged stakes or visible consequences required for Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece opens with atmospheric description that delays orientation (who Lirael is and what she seeks arrives past the 120-word threshold), triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens appears accumulative/textural (tea-leaf geometry, light patterns, archival motifs), but closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the visitor's resolve and the shadow metaphor without legible on-page cost—no forfeited path, no felt price, only declaration. The visitor's journey is told rather than shown, and Lirael's role as facilitator means the stakes rest on another character's off-page future action. The "walk backwards" advice reads as thematic echo rather than a causally grounded directive with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing attempted. Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN cleanly by the waterfall paragraph. The seed's ejection and rainbow geyser provide a visible change, but the cost is unclear—Elara ends lighter and laughing, the orchard thrives, and the blossom replaces the seed without foreclosing a live path. The closure image gestures at continuation ("thread, woven endlessly") but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The net's unraveling drives a single meaningful tightening, and the silver key offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fisherman's choice is reweighted, silence is broken). However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—Mara's "burden she hadn't known she carried" is asserted rather than dramatized. Elias delivers the thematic explanation ("silence isn't always kindness") rather than the ending image proving it, diluting closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—details layer (map tear, film comparison, henge carvings shifting, hum resolving into chant) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes language. Orientation is clear by the vault opening. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: the tear shifts from barrier to bridge, and the henge from ruin to puzzle. Cost is oblique—Elias "understood now" and will "frame this map differently"—felt conceptually but not viscerally paid on the page. One meaningful deepening (silence reinterpreted as hymn) satisfies the length, though the final image ("other silences waited") gestures forward rather than anchoring present consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's investigation accrues discoveries (tape loop, tuning fork frequency, snow globe motor match) that reweight her understanding of "letting go" as transmission rather than release. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sunken ship library, weeks after Earhart discovery). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of learning to "feel the resonance in her own bones" reframes the premise with a felt cost (private work vs. publication, holding on vs. transmission). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum's match to the snow globe shifts her physics metaphor. Cost is legible but somewhat abstract; the "ache of holding on too tight" remains more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (balladeer, misty courtyard, between lightning and thunder). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated encoding gestures and the storm's arrival, with the final bluebell press serving as a charged image. However, no meaningful tightening occurs—each message is written without complication, and the storm passes without altering Elias's options or forcing a trade-off. The closure (walking away with the pressed bluebell, "a ghost smiled") offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page; no prior action is foreclosed, no live tension resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The diary discovery shifts Mara's goal from tidying to truth-seeking, and the goggles reveal hidden patterns—a meaningful tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara steps onto the tenth floor with diary and goggles, the widow's grief cracking, and a flame flickering above the clouds. The cost is felt (the widow's mask breaks, Mara commits to ascent), though the final beat could sharpen the foreclosed path more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing lens—Lila's theory is validated experientially in the void—but the closure lacks a decisive, on-page cost that forecloses an option or relationship. The gondola drifts, she catalogs a new cloud, and the journey continues; this reads as continuation rather than transformation. Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early), and the broken-string inciting incident sets up the void encounter, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion ("the sky remembers") without dramatizing what Lila has sacrificed or altered tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira walks away with the safe and coin, a resonant reconfiguration of her role from documentarian to custodian. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern and discovery deepen rather than narrow via causal reversals. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wrecking ball strikes and she must choose, though the cost (theft,职业 breach) is more asserted than dramatized on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (tree, commission, demolition crew). The before/after is legible: she arrived to paint decay, leaves as keeper of secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal (hopscotch → coordinates → starling gap → portal leap), and orientation anchors early (airship, dusk, Lira's role). The closure—Lira's leap and return with visions—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("She'd charted...") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible consequence that narrows her world. The coordinate-deciphering linkage is compressed ("by dawn, she'd deciphered it") and the phrasebook clue "when the murmurations part" resolves too conveniently without friction. One meaningful tightening occurs (gap revealed → leap), but the portal's mechanics arrive late without groundwork, weakening inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when anchored by paragraph two) and follows a linear search-and-find structure under a Causal lens. The closure unit—finding the gears and claiming "he felt ready"—lands on the page, but the cost is declared rather than demonstrated: no tactic changes, no visible sacrifice, no foreclosed option. The final paragraph's "time, like memory, could always be mended" shifts into thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (the mirror dissolves, revealing the alcove), but the ending deflates into soft reassurance without felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the arch is reinforced through collective effort summarized in a single paragraph, and Elara "fades into the twilight" without a decisive change or stance crystallization that forecloses a path. The causal chain is skeletal—messages appear, settlers mobilize, problem solved—with no meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The inferred lens (Causal) weakens at closure when the resolution is told rather than dramatized, and no felt price lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (singing the lullaby/accepting flaws) with visible cost (lighthouse groaning, pane cracking, puppet shattering, clocks slowing worldwide). Causal lens holds: Mara climbs → finds the pane → places the puppet → sings → world responds. The Cost Proof Test is met: "The pane of hush began to crack, its fractal patterns unraveling like a frayed rope" and "The broken puppet head shattered, its porcelain pieces raining down like snow" provide on-page legibility. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses her palm and memories flood, narrowing her path to the final song.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: Kael's knowledge of the blueprint enables each tactic (marker placement, door discovery), and the traveler's rescue satisfies the curse. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the curse is satisfied "for now," paths will reset) with conceptual cost (endless recurrence) legible in the final beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds converge and he slams the door, narrowing options and forcing the nut's use.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: foam patterns, braided rivers, and chrysalis accumulate toward a thematic reweighting. Orientation is established early (ravine, Elara's work, sister estrangement). However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara's shift from isolation to reconciliation occurs through summary ("loosened grief let her type back") rather than on-page forfeiture or crystallized stance. The weeks-later coda dissipates pressure rather than landing a decisive final image. The insight about separation/connection is declared rather than dramatized at the closure beat, and no live option is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, her stall, opening day) appear early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the man's request and the floating note create a pattern of absence → presence. However, closure relies on Elara's internal assertion ("she understood") rather than a visible cost or constraint that forecloses a path. The golden residue and her walk outside suggest Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "grateful for the absence" framing tells rather than shows a felt trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (the man's departure with the jar), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse, not anchored to a specific on-page sacrifice or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the pavilion, immersion in the pool, subsuming the founder's guilt, and the final cooking act build a legible progression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Nessar "learned to carry [remorse] differently"—with felt cost ("his legs unsteady," salt-stiff apron). Orientation is swift (fortress, chef, pavilion within ~15% of text). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening rather than a causal reversal, fitting this lens. One minor cost-proof gap: the assertion that "the fortress felt sturdier" is stated more than shown, nudging the score below 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where exactly she stands in the tower, and what immediate obstacle she faces remain vague past the opening paragraphs. The dominant stake—fixing the rift between villagers and scholars—is declared but never tested on the page; no villager resists, no gear fails her twice, no cost appears until the ending grants her success. The closure unit (villagers gather, offer help, Elara descends) is a Decisive Change in social configuration, but it arrives without visible resistance or price; the weight swings, the crowd applauds, and the problem dissolves. Because no meaningful tightening or reversal occurs under pressure, the ending reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, canyon, nighttime) arrive early enough. The piece signals a causal lens: Kael adjusts tools → mirror glows → memories surface → headband feedback threatens → he adjusts dials → mirror seals. However, the closure—"He'd done it"—lacks visible cost; the mirror is "whole again, but transformed" without foreclosing a live option or showing what Kael sacrificed to achieve synaptic entanglement. The woman's voice returns "clearer now, intertwined with his own thoughts," but no on-page image demonstrates felt price or a decision that narrows future agency. The ending reads as successful completion rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Lira seeks the seeds of vigilance, finds the manuscript, gravity inverts, she follows the map to the keys. Orientation anchors arrive early (grotto, her role, the ticking watch). The closure—emerging with a key and a new identity—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("latent blaze," "keeper of thresholds") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The gravity inversion functions as spectacle rather than a constraint that narrows her options, weakening the felt stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: sensory density and pattern recurrence build toward the moment when the stump erupts in sound. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when anchored). The closure unit—the porcelain shattering and the grove singing—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the grove becomes a cathedral of sound), but the cost is largely conceptual and told in retrospect rather than felt on the page in the climactic beat. The phrase "She'd done it" and subsequent summary flatten the immediacy of the breakthrough, and the epilogue extends beyond the closure moment without tightening pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Alaric's correlation work (tracing the stone's crescent to the eclipse, remembering the queen's diagonal, inserting the key) drives the sequence, and the nexus's responses escalate pressure. Closure lands on-page with the star-mage's appearance and the seed's planting, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the covenant is reborn. Cost is present but oblique—the "hopeful melancholy" and tears suggest emotional weight, yet no tactical option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when), and the celestial alignment timeframe structures urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through description, humming experimentation, and diary revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael's understanding of silence reweights her relationship to her grandmother. Cost is felt conceptually—she "carries forward" silences as bridges—but the final image ("learned to listen") leans toward assertion rather than a charged visual moment that makes cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows a clear causal line: seed arrival → impatient cultivation → dream insight → patient method → bloom. Orientation is established early (treetop village, herbalist, corpse flower seed). The closure is a Decisive Change—the flower blooms and the village shifts from restless to peaceful—but the cost is vague; Lira's "ambition tempered by patience" is stated rather than dramatized as a specific forfeiture. The drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture, holding adequately but without the constraint-driven pressure that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the arrow tip guides her to the cavern, she inserts it, and the planet's resilience is revealed. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—"resilience comes from willingness to bend, to store, to echo"—but the cost is abstract and off-page; no visible forfeiture or tactical alteration follows the discovery. The "gathering of echoes" as living archive is told rather than dramatized with a felt price, and the protagonist's shift to guardian lacks on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—"the machine was hungry"—but the cost remains abstract; Anya descends with the patch "still warm" without forfeiting a live option or demonstrating what she has lost or risked on the page. The causal link between the patch's vibrations, the engineer's device, and the "feedback loop" is asserted rather than dramatized, creating a motivational gap at the pivotal discovery. The inferred lens is Causal, but the because/therefore chain from surveying to finding the engineer relies on convenience (she looks up at the right moment) rather than her investigative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the cavern now "sings"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence demonstrates what Lira or Veyra lost or forfeited to reach this state. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery building to a sonic payoff), yet the final image delivers atmospheric satisfaction without reweighting prior stakes or demonstrating felt sacrifice. The sculptor's marble awakening and Lira's bell-ringing success land as convenient coincidence rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the flute opens a passage, the specter delivers riddle, Kael plays discordantly and breaks the flute, then learns silence is key. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure—retrieving broken reeds and etching a new rune—suggests Resonant Reconfiguration (surrender replaces mastery), but the cost is muted: the flute can be repaired, the walk home feels more symbolic than decisive, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The mentor's moth-dissolution and starfield visions function as atmosphere more than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure—Elias "understanding" that emotions are rhythms, not equations—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: we're told he "finally" sees, yet no prior path is visibly foreclosed. The causal lens wobbles: the fragment's "defenses" and the press's mechanics are introduced but their rules shift opportunistically to deliver the epiphany. One meaningful tightening (the fragment merging their empathy) is present, but the resolution feels granted by artifact rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pendant's vibration intensifies, Veyra's cryptic lessons accumulate meaning, and the final germination image reweights "seeds" from metaphor to literal action with visible cost (the pendant stills, Kail's role shifts from courier to soil). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kail kneels and plants the seed, transforming his understanding. The cost is legible: his mentor's absence becomes permanent conceptual closure, and the pendant's function ends. Minor slip: the woman's arrival and dissolution feel coincidental rather than causally motivated by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV and signals a causal lens: Mara's method (prism + frost) triggers the arbor's glow, then the frost shatters, forcing realization. However, the closure—"the quartz didn't absorb emotions, it mirrored them"—lands as told epiphany rather than a choice or image that forecloses options with visible cost. The prism is tucked away and Mara stands "at peace," but no on-page price reshapes her stance or tactics. Closure form reads as Conceptual Repricing, yet the conceptual cost remains abstract ("secrets safe") rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear spatial anchors (orchard, bamboo, loom) within the opening lines and builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's sacrifice of the bead and shift to weaving silence forecloses her direct connection but enables the distant village's restoration—Charged Poise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the puzzle completion acts as a pattern break that reweights the silence motif. The cost is legible in "the beads dimmed, their light fading" and "the loom stilled." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the middle section (puzzle-solving weeks) compresses agency into summary ("For weeks, Mara worked...") rather than dramatizing a single high-pressure attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and moves in a causal chain (silk → mines → Lira → orb → renewal). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible result (orchards bloom, arches steady), but the cost is entirely physical suffering narrated in summary; no tactical trade-off or renunciation constrains future options on the page. The lens reads Causal with a light Situational accent (spectral keeper confronts intruder), held through closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jorin chooses the center tunnel and Lira materializes, raising the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear causal-hybrid lens: Kael's compulsion drives portal entry, the parallel universe reveals his mother's knowledge, and his choice to throw the shard closes one possibility with visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (visor, bay, shard in belt). The closure unit—hurling the shard and waking without it—functions as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("The weight was gone"). One substantive tightening occurs when the woman's line "some doors need to stay closed" reframes the premise, narrowing Kael's options to either keep pursuing or release the search.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the anonymous letter chain builds density through stacked stones, sea glass, and chimes, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elias finds connection despite the dead lamp. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"a new kind of light glowed—not of flame, but of connection"—with the cost legible in the persistent darkness and his acceptance of fragility. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by paragraph one. One friction: the letters' mechanism (who writes them, how they appear overnight) remains vague, creating minor causal opacity that does not break the accumulative design but softens the felt necessity of each exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when are scattered across the opening third without early anchoring. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (shadows coalesce, colors shift, light "bursts free"), but the final image offers no decisive reweighting or visible cost: she raises the lantern, feels "purpose," and the dawn arrives as expected. No meaningful tightening occurs; the Herald's actions (adjust wick, step to balcony, raise lantern) do not narrow options or change knowledge. Closure reads as Charged Poise in aspiration, but the cost is asserted ("the one who dared") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the wing's movement through the tea house gathers sensory and thematic density until it vanishes, leaving Lin with a new mission. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final paragraph crystallizes her stance and reconfigures her purpose—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a visible forfeiture. The escalation from private observation to shared story-moment to vocation is legible, though the wing's disappearance as trigger feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias disassembles the sextant, sketches its parts, maps dreams, and walks deeper into the tower. However, the closure—"even in decay, there was beauty"—arrives as a stated insight rather than a legible reconfiguration with visible cost. The pin's echo bookends the piece but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (location and who are clear, but the inciting situation—why now, what choice faces him—remains vague until the sextant work begins), warranting a small penalty under the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph (acceptable) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ending where the realm begins to wake. However, the closure cost is asserted rather than shown: we're told the work is "not done" and that memories are "fragile," but no specific path is foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sensory details, recurring images, atmospheric density), but the ending delivers exposition about hope spreading rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material. The mica window mechanism appears suddenly without prior setup of how songs enter windows or ignite fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal chain: invitation → password → society → map → mirrors → key → letters. However, the closure—Eleanor staying with letters, realizing hiding means "choosing when to reveal"—lacks visible cost; she simply sits, and the insight is told rather than demonstrated through a forfeited path or a decision that narrows options. The ending reconfigures her understanding but the price remains abstract, not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images (bread, seed, saplings) layer toward a quiet resonance. Orientation anchors late—tea house interior arrives ~250 words in, courtyard geography remains vague—but the pattern is legible by closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias commits to tending), yet cost is asserted ("tenuous absolution," "process") rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or visible price. The bread's vanishing and seed substitution gesture at mystery but don't narrow tactics or change what Elias can do next. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery to commitment), sufficient for length, but the cost proof test falters: no exact sentence makes the trade-off undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal: sampling frequencies reconstructs vows, which reignites the library's magic. One meaningful tightening occurs when the warrior's vow flares and then dims, forcing Elara to sample faster. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (the illusions brighten at dawn), but the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt—no visible path foreclosed or renunciation dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (Saltspire Pier, pirate market, moonshine runner's daughter). The drive lens reads Causal with event-linked pressure: bribe fails → courier chase fails → eavesdrop yields intel → tower confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change: Lira smashes the device and flees, ending with the cracked watch fob still ticking—a resonant image of damaged continuity. Cost is visible (fob broken, market chaos, father's reputation shattered by the recording). One weakness: the buyer's late entrance and instant defeat feel compressed; the recording's content (father pleading) arrives without prior setup, creating a small causality gap in the climax that slightly undermines the earned weight of Lira's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details (lavender, aurora, taste shifts) layer toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael moves from dismissing the unexplainable to accepting "terrestrially cosmic" phenomena woven into soil and sky—but the cost is told ("lavender and regret") rather than shown through a forfeited path or altered stance. The forests' election resolves off-page, weakening on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from arrival through painting to shadow-door opening in one continuous scene. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias "rectifies the silence" and begins sketching freely—but the cost remains emotional declaration ("relief," "truly seen") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. Orientation is prompt: who/where/when anchor by the opening paragraph. The linkage is associative and image-driven rather than because/therefore, which fits the lens, but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it dissolves the cave into insignificance rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a lyric accent: the map leads to Room 12, the quill detects lies, the keeper's revelation changes Elara's understanding, and the final image reweights the Archive from literal repository to symbolic seed. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Virelum, greenhouse city, Elara's trade and quest). One meaningful tightening occurs when the quill wilts and the keeper emerges, narrowing Elara's options and reframing the Archive's nature. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the orb shifts from "empty" to "seed," reweighting hope with visible cost—Elara accepts loss but commits to planting memory. Cost is legible in her acceptance that words are gone yet she moves forward anyway, though the final image leans slightly abstract ("plant the seed where the oasis once was").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Elara finds fragment → builds sculpture → performs → fragment melts → final bell strike. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the symphony "transformed"), but the cost is conceptual and abstract—no visible forfeiture or change in Elara's options on the page. The final paragraph's "remind" and "released" are thematic assertions rather than dramatized consequences, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with hybrid causal elements. Orientation anchors (android, farm, dome) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The controlled burn sequence provides one meaningful tightening—box to orb to integration—that reweights Clara-7's static from burden to song. However, the cost at closure is asserted ("whole," "lighter," "clear") rather than shown through a forfeited option or tactical constraint. The magnetic storm complicates but does not decisively shape the final choice, and the box's fraying seals set up pressure that dissipates without a felt price when the orb dissolves into her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with investigative accumulation. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure unit—opening the mailbox and reading the letters—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract (tears, not tactical or relational loss). The combination-lock solution feels convenient: the locket's inscription "leads through following" does not causally teach the three-number mechanism; the leap from stories to birth year/enlistment date/marriage year occurs off-page without dramatized discovery. One reversal (noticing the locket) but escalation compresses to summary in the middle week.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Kael emerging with the vial after his defiant waltz freezes the drones—reads as Charged Poise under a Causal lens; however, the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page. The drones' sudden freeze ("humbled by his resolve") breaks earned causality; no prior setup explains why rhythm would overload their sensors. The final paragraph offers thematic summary rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain (coffee-ground divination → hidden panel → rose chamber → memory discovery) that holds under a hybrid lens tilting toward Accumulative/Textural at closure. However, the Resonant Reconfiguration depends on告知 rather than embodied cost: Elias "no longer feared" and gains "a new purpose" without forfeiting a live option or paying a visible price on the page. The cost—what he gives up by accepting preservation over restoration—remains implicit rather than legible in the final image. Orientation is clean; the closure lands but without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but causality is declarative: the summoner places the wing, it glows, the prophecy is "hushed into submission" without on-page resistance or reversal. The closure unit—wing crumbles, prophecy defused—occurs by passive mechanics rather than protagonist agency reweighting options. No meaningful tightening or cost legible on the page; the "fracture" and "storm" remain abstract threats never tested. Inferred lens is nominally Situational, but pressure never crystallizes into a stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene with clear causal steps (note → meeting → revelation → ritual). The closure lands on the page (the library answers), but the cost remains abstract—what Elias has forfeited or risked by "lying to the building" is asserted in dialogue rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical consequence. The inferred lens is Causal, and linkage holds, but the final beat's pressure is conceptual rather than materially legible, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with strong sensory anchoring (velvet garden, twilight, seashell) and tracks a single POV through one continuous ritual. The closure unit—memories as sparks that burn and leave "constellations of light"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract: the garden turns to ash, yet Lirael feels "lighter" without visible forfeiture of a live option. The causal chain from shell-whisper to memory-circle to spark-transformation reads more as lyric accumulation than motivated escalation, and the final walk away doesn't narrow prior stakes so much as announce resolution. "Repurposing" is told rather than shown altering tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with Lirael as sole on-page character, meeting Track A defaults. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—she completes the forgery, places it, and departs—but the cost is abstract ("her purpose") rather than a legible trade-off or foreclosed option on the page. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image of her vanishing "leaving only the echo of her purpose" gestures toward reconfiguration but lacks the felt price or cadence shift that would constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but "when" remains vague throughout. The closure unit—Kael understanding his purpose and singing while the canyon answers—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or altered tactic appears on the page. The reveal from the hooded figure is purely expository and does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence shift lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural (dream-to-dream layering toward thematic synthesis). Orientation is adequate: who, where established by ~100 words. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final shrine image, but no visible or felt cost is legible on the page—Kael smiles, descends with starlight guidance, and the windows "flow freely" without evident trade-off or foreclosed option. The three dream vignettes unfold in parallel summary without causal linkage or deepening pressure, failing the one meaningful tightening test. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at closure makes a price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by the opening). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael listens, follows sound, discovers a firefly code, and watches until dawn. One meaningful deepening occurs when he decodes the pattern, reweighting his philosophical stance, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing (the world's beauty lies in hidden labor), yet the final image ("watched the fireflies until dawn") does not charge prior material with undeniable pressure or a legible price paid. The lens holds, but closure lacks the sharp cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (wasteland orchard, Mara kneeling). The closure—placing the flawed diamond to seal the stillpoint—lands on the page, but the cost is environmental (radiation drops, orchard relaxes) rather than a visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for Mara herself. The letters deliver exposition that enables the solution rather than narrowing her choices through prior causality. One meaningful tightening occurs (fissure opens, dual-diamond reveal), but the final act feels like puzzle-solving without a felt price that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through radio transmissions and storm imagery. Orientation is adequate (Kael, observatory, storm) but the closure—sand swirling, storm ebbing, glass glowing—reads as affirmation rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; no option is narrowed, no renunciation occurs, and the "new dawn" remains abstract promise. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the ending delivers symbolic convergence without on-page consequence that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Kael has forfeited or what path he has foreclosed by activating the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by line 2 (who, where, when). The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: Elias opens jars, the box plays, the village responds. However, closure lacks legible cost—he returns to the loft successful with jingling coins and renewed purpose, a soft affirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence at the ending demonstrates what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening and delivers a clear closure: Elias stabilizes the key and accepts his role as guardian. The causal lens holds through the confrontation, but the ghost's capitulation ("You… understand") lacks sufficient prior setup—its rage dissolves without a dramatized cost or trade-off that the protagonist's actions specifically earned. The resonator's mechanics shift purpose (ice-shattering to soul-harmonizing) without on-page explanation of how Elias knew to adapt it this way, creating a small causality gap at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mild situational pressure. Orientation anchors (Kael, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, post-freeze timeframe) land early. The piece accumulates texture through repeated moon-mapping beats and viaduct adjustments, building toward the dawn resonance and the elders' approval. However, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the viaduct hums, elders approve, Kael continues his work) without a decisive on-page choice or visible cost that forecloses a path—Kael's stance at the end is identical to his stance at the start, and the weeks-long coda dilutes the closure moment. The cost (aching back, tiredness) is fleeting and does not reweight options or meaning at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Mara investigates, lights the lantern, receives visions, discovers files, resolves to act. Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, when). However, closure lacks visible cost—Mara's decision to expose Cole is announced in final-paragraph summary ("She'd use the lantern one last time... through empirical observation") rather than shown through an on-page action that forecloses a path. The "done being controlled" stance reads as Charged Poise, but the price (professional risk, loss of the lantern's power, confrontation consequences) remains offstage. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Mara sacrifices or loses in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through the shop atmosphere, Mrs. Elms's explanation, and the clockwork heart symbol toward a final reconfiguration of Marcus's understanding. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure—Marcus's resolve to act—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract ("deliberate, meaningful steps") rather than a specific foreclosed path or felt price. One meaningful deepening is present (the heart reveals hidden purpose), meeting minimum scope, but the ending reconfigures meaning without making the trade-off undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: kaleidoscope images layer until the final hum reweights the quest. Closure lands on the page (the bell hums, the algorithm works), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid or path foreclosed in the ending beat. The workshop-to-tower leap compresses causality; the tower's sudden appearance and the arrow's transformation into "conductor's baton" arrive without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraph. Causal lens is attempted: Lira follows numbers → finds encrypted video → discovers coordinates → uploads them. However, the closure relies on convenient timing (alarms blare exactly when she cracks the code) and Lira's escape is asserted off-page ("was already gone") without showing the cost or mechanism. The video revelation that "they're using it to delete people" arrives too late to shape her prior tactics, functioning more as exposition than earned discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hale confronts her, but the final beat substitutes declaration ("she was done") for visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (lighthouse orchard, shifting ice, Elara). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara collects mirror-glimpses, weaves empathy threads, and the fragment glows—culminating in the ice stilling and aurora brightening. However, the closure lacks legible cost; the storm gains "a heart" and the floes still, but no on-page price (a forfeited path, a visible trade-off, or a felt consequence) is paid. The resonant reconfiguration is asserted rather than dramatized with cost, preventing full closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: Lila's volunteer work accumulates pressure toward a clinic visit, then the rescue forces a stance shift. However, the closure unit—"flicker of something like peace"—lacks legible cost on the page; we're told she feels peace but not what path or option she has foreclosed or what price she's paid. The rescue itself is driven by coincidence (the sound, the fissure) rather than Lila's prior choices narrowing options. The "fold in patience" concept appears twice but doesn't constrain tactics or reweight the ending image with visible cost, remaining thematic decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (vineyard, pavilion, Elias, autumn twilight). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through Lila's voiced emptiness, the burned letter as charged object, and Elias's philosophy, culminating in her smile and walk—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she reweights her pursuit of "perfect match." Cost is felt in her abandoning the easel and accepting imbalance, though the image could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lila takes the letter and later tucks it into her coat, signaling a shift. The causal chain is clean within the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, what "line walker" means, and why she's waiting remain abstract past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure offers no decisive change—Mara replaces her mask and walks on exactly as before, the echo "preserved" without visible cost or altered options. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design but delivers only decorative recurrence (pavilion hums, dunes shift) without pressure tightening or a final image that reweights prior material. No felt cost at closure; the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves through observation → sketching → dove encounter → new sketch with film roll, showing a pattern of deepening engagement. However, the closure—"enough" plus returning with film—reads as affirmation rather than reconfiguration with felt cost; Lila's options do not visibly narrow or change. Orientation anchors who/where/when early and cleanly. One micro-turn (dove appearance) adds texture but does not alter stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (scholar, library, dawn). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns accumulate through crystal reflections, ivy metaphors, and notes until the final image reweights Elias's stance from silent to speaking. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—"the work had just begun" signals future effort rather than a visible present-tense forfeiture. The tightening is present but the felt price at the closure moment is diffuse, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through fog, sculpture garden, driftwood markers, and the search for a sound). Orientation anchors who and where early enough; when is hazier ("amid the hush of old videotapes" is atmospheric but vague). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias "didn't need to see the future anymore" after hearing the sound—a renunciation with implicit cost (the gift is released). However, the cost feels declared rather than demonstrated; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the "enough" legible as a trade-off. The accumulative design (fog, echoes, markers, sound) coheres under the inferred lens, but the final image lacks the sharp reweighting or visible price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: trembling ground → spinning hand → Elias's repairs → portal opening → leap. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the closure—Elias leaping into the portal—feels enabled by late-breaking world logic (the rift) rather than earned through prior tactical narrowing. The hand's "signal" decoding and portal mechanics are introduced in the final third without sufficient grounding, weakening the cost legibility of his departure. One meaningful tightening is present (hand accelerates, systems must sync), but the stakes shift from "stop the hand" to "enter the portal" without clear forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the hymn's repetition and vinyl motif aim to deepen meaning through recurrence. Orientation anchors adequately (Mira, hospice, sunrise, Elias's impending death by ~150 words). Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira witnesses Elias's peaceful passage and passes the vinyl shard to Clara, reweighting the legacy motif—but the cost is implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; we infer continuation of her work rather than see a path foreclosed. The final paragraph's "pulsing stillness" and humming gesture gesture toward reconfiguration but lack a sharp before/after that makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when by paragraph one). The piece follows a causal lens with because/therefore linkage: spoons bend reality → runes stir → key aligns with constellation → gateway revealed. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Lirael inserts the key and immediately sees the answer with no sacrifice, failed attempt, or tactical tradeoff. The decisive change is a revelation rather than a choice that forecloses options. The Cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence shows what Lirael gave up or lost to achieve this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals orientation by ~120 words (Mara in the garden with the tooth) and establishes a dominant stake (solving the garden's mysteries). The closure unit—placing both teeth in the fountain—activates causal machinery (water flows, hedges shudder, path clears), but the mechanism feels more symbolic than dramatized with felt cost. The phrase "cleft in certainty closed" is told rather than shown through a choice that narrows options. Elias's reappearance introduces potential reversal, but his explanation ("it asks for sacrifice") arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized conflict, weakening the causal chain to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Elara, grotto, present-tense task. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—memory fragments and polishing beats layer toward the final release. However, closure lacks felt cost: the pearl dissolves, passersby react, but no on-page price or foreclosed path is dramatized. The ending gesture is lyric and quiet, yet the "before/after" remains conceptual rather than visceral. The scale-balancing beat gestures at equilibrium but does not tighten options or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph without penalty. The piece follows a causal lens: Lila waits → Elias arrives → dialogue deepens understanding → joint planting action. Closure is a Decisive Change (she invites him to stay, they plant together, she accepts moss in the pendant) with relational cost (exposing protected space to another). However, the tightening is modest—Elias's arrival doesn't narrow options so much as confirm a pre-existing readiness, and the viral confession functions as backdrop rather than live pressure that forces the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who Clara is and why she's at the nexus emerges gradually through reflection rather than anchored action, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure—deleting the neat ending and writing a new open one—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we don't see what Clara forfeits by refusing closure. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mist-shapes, whispers, spiral motif), but the final beat pivots to a causal decision (manuscript revision) without prior escalation of that specific choice, creating lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative lens appears intended—golden threads, mushrooms, stream revival—but the closure relies on assertion ("the world felt whole again") rather than a dramatized reconfiguration that reweights prior material with visible cost. The sequence is and-then rather than because/therefore: Lira plays → things happen → she plants a seed, with no narrowing of options or felt price that charges the final image. The "for now" hedge and the fox's "again tomorrow?" gesture toward ongoing work but do not land a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when clearly and follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias's methodical sealing process builds toward the plate's activation. Closure arrives on-page as the starlight flows into him and he wraps the plate, but the cost remains abstract—"the world would have to wait" gestures at opportunity cost without dramatizing what path he forecloses or what specific price he pays. The orientation is clean, the lens holds, but the closure unit lacks the felt or visible sacrifice required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: Elias maps the cavern's rhythms over repeated visits, discovers hidden etchings, and finally reassembles the timer in a tightening that restores the harvest. Yet closure—the timer humming, echoes captured, keepers waiting below—feels like mission-accomplished rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The "miracle" is declared rather than charged by a visible price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates seven burdens through discrete beats, each melting/weaving cycle deepening the dominant stake (collecting weights, not wounds). Closure arrives as Earned Stasis when Kael refuses his mother's locket—a renunciation that forecloses the path with felt cost ("Some burdens, he realized, were meant to stay buried"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One minor slip: the village arrival and workshop storage feel like a soft reset that diffuses rather than charges the ending image, slightly weakening the cost legibility of the locket refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the loft session accumulates sensory detail and reflection toward a final image reweighting loss. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Clara chooses to continue carving the void into form), but the cost is conceptual rather than legibly felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The "while the kettle boiled" frame promises tightening that never materializes; the kettle goes cold without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure when Veyra releases the camera wheel and sleeps. However, the cost of this renunciation is asserted ("I'm tired") rather than demonstrated through a visible foreclosed path; the rose appearance and her walking into the lagoon read as symbolic reward rather than price paid. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (fragment-collecting, lyric imagery) and Causal (ghost confrontation), and the final image's conceptual weight is undercut by the fishermen coda, which diffuses rather than charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying baseline requirements. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers atmosphere and engineering metaphor toward a final image—but the "resurrection" mechanism lacks causal grounding: Lila's tool use and the terminal's response are asserted rather than dramatized with legible steps. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the projected equation, yet the cost remains abstract ("raw, untested") rather than felt on the page. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the closure's conceptual cost is insufficiently materialized to enter high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Lira, workshop, dawn). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: petrichor seeps, forecourt hums, bear appears, all building to Lira's reconfiguration of the keep as compass rather than prison. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—"silence between beats, where dreams breathe"—that reweights her stance with felt cost (years of constriction acknowledged). One deduction: the cost could be sharper; the shift from workshop to listening is named more than it forecloses a legible path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the sundial points, Elias follows, discovers blueprint—minimal because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("the sundial wasn't a map to a place; it was a map to a way of seeing"), but the cost is abstract philosophical clarity rather than a felt forfeiture on the page. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canal, barge, Elias). One meaningful tightening occurs (shadow redirects to warehouse), but no live option is foreclosed with visible price—he simply walks in and finds confirmation. The "architecture of lies" blueprint feels like a prompt echo rather than an earned discovery that narrows his world.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: fulgurite glass → knot decoding → woman's revelation → final understanding. However, the closure unit—Elias kneeling and recognizing preservation as the legacy—lacks visible cost; he gains wisdom without forfeiting a live option or enduring dramatized friction. The woman's appearance feels coincidental rather than causally motivated, and her vanishing into fog substitutes atmosphere for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: Elara seeks the thread, experiences a vision, writes the woman's story, and departs with renewed purpose. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she arrives seeking answers and leaves "lighter" with "heart open," a pure gain that forecloses no path. The vision sequence offers atmospheric density but no causal tightening; the woman simply appears, is described, vanishes. The final three paragraphs recycle the mission statement without reweighting prior material or making a trade-off legible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraph. A causal lens is discernible: Corvin assembles the contraption, adjusts the lens, the egg cracks, the orb emerges and transforms the world. However, the final transformation lacks visible cost—Corvin's hand closes around the orb and the palace blooms without any on-page forfeiture, renunciation, or tactical narrowing. The closure reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. One meaningful tightening (the egg cracking) is present, but the resolution is gifted by the orb's autonomous magic rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—scars-as-growth pattern established early and reprised at closure. Orientation is clear (lagoon, Lira alone, then group arrives). The closure image (grain of black sand vanishing, "scars sing" theme restated) offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift accompanies the realization. The bird's release is Mara's change, not Lira's; Lira remains observer. Missing a protagonist-driven tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story teaches a causal lens (breadcrumb collection → box completion → fountain restoration) and delivers a Decisive Change on the page with visible environmental transformation. However, orientation is delayed: "who" (Lira's role/history) and "when" (the geese pause is poetic but unanchored) remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure itself lands cleanly with the fountains roaring and memories released, but the cost is environmental spectacle rather than a felt price to Lira—her final walk home carries no visible forfeiture or reconfiguration of her own options.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece orients who/where/when adequately by ~120 words. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the insight about wielding light without violence, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—Lumin places the gear down and walks away without forfeiting a live stake or altering concrete options. The ghost's exposition ("light *is* fire, child") delivers the turn through tell rather than causal pressure, weakening the because/therefore linkage. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the calculating-machine setup and the quest structure), the resolution feels given rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly returns, ancestral stories layering, butterfly migration marking seasonal passage. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when), and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marlow shifts from silent mourner to poem-crafter with the ribbon as symbolic bridge. However, the decisive moment (writing and reading the poem) lacks visible cost; the voice vanishes without confrontation, and the "tomorrow" promise of carving a new gravestone pushes consequence off-page. The butterfly flood functions more as atmospheric intensification than causal pressure, and the spectral mentorship concludes without friction or renunciation, weakening the felt cost required for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens: the Hush creates coherent pressure, and the rake inscription deepens Lirael's understanding, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when she restores the pendulum's swing. Closure lands on the page with visible relief (ridge cracks sealing, tide surging gently), and the cost is legible in her "raw hands" and the embodied struggle. The structure is clean—single POV, continuous scene—but the escalation is more additive than causal; the solution arrives through recognition rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads accumulative/textural but the closure lands as pure summary: "She would rebury the case, letting the dead rest once more, but she would carry the knowledge with her." No on-page decisive change, renunciation with felt cost, or image that reconfigures prior pressure—only a told intention to rebury and an abstract claim of carried knowledge. The chess clock and tapestry set up pattern but dissolve into explanation rather than a charged final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by early paragraphs), preventing deeper penalty, but closure itself lacks the required on-page cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and tracks a single continuous project from blank page to thaw. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (the ice breaks, the village adapts), but the cost is collective and environmental rather than personal; Lira's final act is to smile and burn journals—a symbolic gesture without visible forfeiture of a live option. The lens reads Causal (predictive modeling → thaw), yet the pivotal beat (equinox observation) happens off-page in a "weeks passed" summary, weakening the because/therefore chain at the moment of highest stakes. One meaningful tightening is present but the cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments gather, the broadcast intensifies, the final image of Lira stepping into the night reweights her quest with a quiet cadence shift. However, the closure lacks a felt cost that forecloses an option—she ends exactly where she began, collecting fragments, with no visible sacrifice or tactical change. The structure is a single continuous scene, and causality within the broadcast sequence is clean, but the Resonant Reconfiguration reads more as affirmation than crystallization of stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds atmosphere and image density toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Lira, vanishing point gallery, the rocking chair's halt) arrive early. The closure—Lira leaving the unfinished portrait, knowing "safety is an illusion"—offers Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt in a decisive on-page forfeit or shift. The midpoint exchange and the ash-settling beat function as texture rather than causal turns, which fits the lens, yet the ending reconfigures meaning more by summary ("the mirage of safety lingers") than by a charged final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph. A causal lens is inferrable: Elias's belief in the cog leads him to dig, which reveals fragments that fuel his argument, culminating in the makeshift astrolabe and his claim of hearing "the city's heartbeat." However, closure rests on assertion ("It's the sound of a thousand narratives, all competing. All *true*") rather than a decisive change with legible cost on the page; Mara's hesitation ("But she didn't leave") and Elias "finally felt… understood" are micro-turns that suggest Charged Poise, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than forecloses a path or alters tactics in a visible way.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The piece lacks a decisive on-page change or legible cost at closure: the choir simply "grew" and the zither rosette "spun" without narrowing options or reweighting prior material. The ending offers thematic echo ("something new could take root") but no felt consequence or Charged Poise crystallization. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight the dominant stake with visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet light, pruning cuts, memory floods build toward the bud's glow. However, closure is asserted rather than enacted—"she'd proven that...beauty could still grow" tells the reader the transformation succeeded without showing a decisive on-page choice or visible cost that forecloses a path. The notebook sketch of future plans arrives as expansion rather than reconfiguration. Cost is claimed conceptually but not legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who/where/when anchored by ~100 words). The closure—Clara speaking to passersby and the tower powering back up—presents a Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we see wonder return but not what Clara sacrifices or forecloses. The causal chain from drone failure → Voss explanation → Clara's speech works, but Voss's arrival and exposition feel coincidental rather than earned by Clara's agency. The "reignite wonder" resolution lands too easily without tactical narrowing or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors "who" and "where" early (Lira, the bay) but delays the specific present action until mid-story, making the opening feel like extended setup. Drive lens reads as Accumulative: the displaced objects accrue meaning through association and the final glow/sanctification reweights the bay's "hush." The closure moment (the glow, houses feeling alive, Lira's smile) lands on the page and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than visceral—no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice is visible. The "sanctification" feels more like a revelation than a choice with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (underwater garden, Mara, Lumen) land by ~80 words. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: Mara seeks answers → Lumen projects ampoule location → structural weakness enables retrieval → three cascading revelations → drinking catalyst → blight recedes. Closure is a Decisive Change (ocean begins healing) with Conceptual Repricing (ampoule as catalyst not cure), though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page—Mara's sacrifice or transformation remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes her grandmother's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the staircase loops and proofs accumulate until the rupture crystallizes perpetual motion, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (who, where, what) land within ~100 words. The rupture beat narrows his quest from possession to acknowledgment, and the final image reweights the opening obsession with visible cost (the dice orbit beyond reach). One meaningful tightening is present and sufficient for this length; closure lands with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions: the brush, moon, and greenhouse accumulate symbolic weight. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("Kindness outlives the tongue that speaks it"), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no tangible option is foreclosed on the page. Mr. Voss's appearance is coincidental; his recognition of Elena solves Lila's search for proof without her agency driving the discovery. The waxing moon timeframe is mentioned but does not tighten decisions. Orientation is clear early, but the closure image ("To love is to translate") leans toward theme statement rather than felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated mentions of arts, bread, lens, thaw, culminating in the children's festival. Orientation anchors cleanly by the grotto tour opening. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Lila moves from solitary guide to communal teacher), but the cost is asserted ("fragile optimism," "rosewater dread remained") rather than made legible in a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. The beekeeper's absence is mentioned twice but never constrains a tactic or charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraph and follows a clear causal chain: Elias finds the yoyo inadequate, adds mercury coil, triggers the stone's radiance, which activates the lighthouse. The closure unit is a Decisive Change—the lighthouse mechanism turns in reverse and a path appears—but the cost is unclear. "The world would never be the same" is asserted, not demonstrated; what has Elias lost or foreclosed? The final image ("clocks hung on the walls, all ticking backward") recycles the opening conceit without reweighting it. Under a Causal lens, the escalation works, but closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough (Mara, funhouse, post-resuscitation). The drive lens reads Causal: Mara enters, consults the dictionary, speaks the paradox, the shadow dissolves, leaving a thread she grips to complete the banishment. Closure is a Decisive Change—the curse mechanism is broken, the cloak now glows gold—but the cost is vague: her hand is seared, yet this doesn't foreclose a visible path or alter her stance in the final beat. The link from paradox-speaking to shadow-death feels asserted rather than earned by prior rule-teaching; the dictionary's mechanics arrive suddenly in the middle without setup.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: Leeward layers sound until the orchard's disorder resolves into a mosaic. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid)—she transforms obstacles into instruments with visible physical cost. Orientation is anchored early (orchard, driftwood, Leeward at the rim). However, the central pressure is steady rather than escalating; she proceeds through the ritual without meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. The ending reconfigures the visual field (chaos → order) but the felt stakes remain abstract, and the cost (fatigue, salt on lips) is more gestural than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes who/where/when efficiently and delivers an on-page Decisive Change: Lira's realization that the gate was meant to keep them in, paired with the shells cracking open. The causal chain—discovery of crack → tunnel descent → journal reveal → watchers' approach → shells awakening—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening. However, the cost remains conceptual (the city's doom) rather than a visible, personal forfeiture that lands in Lira's body or choices at closure, which keeps it out of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: manifesto clue → illuminated A → Tomas → tunnel → chamber → illuminated T → realization. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"Truth is not a weapon. It's a seed"—that reweights the manifesto's history. However, the cost remains largely conceptual and abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price visceral or immediate at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's note-placement ritual is reweighted when she discovers her grandmother's chamber, shifting "interlaced absence" from metaphor to inherited practice. The causal chain holds—curiosity → sound → hidden chamber → grandmother's desk → Elara's own note—with one meaningful tightening. Cost is legible but muted: she connects past and present, but forecloses no live path on the page; the discovery validates rather than challenges her stance. The lens reads Causal with an Accumulative accent at closure, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal beats. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. The blackout-to-vault sequence tightens causally: sound → door → pattern → journal. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (city sank from denial, not disaster) with conceptual cost legible in the journal reveal and Lira's decision to share. One micro turn (realizing the blackout wasn't accidental) deepens stakes. The final swim-home image reweights the opening but the cost feels more thematic than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grief-folding imagery builds through polishing, origami, and lantern-light until the final confrontation. Orientation anchors clearly (workshop on floating island, after shadow's prior visit, twilight). The closure unit—facing the shadow with the lantern and declaring readiness—lands as Charged Poise, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. The line "I see you, and I'm not afraid" reconfigures her stance, yet no prior beat demonstrated what made this moment different from her years of basilica-building and crane-folding.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Elara presses the geode → node appears → she enters → vortex interaction → new crystal and transformed stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she walks away with the new crystal, options reweighted from passive survivor to active hunter. Cost is legible—the observatory is gone, she discards Orion's caution—but the vortex's mechanics (how it generates the new crystal) remain abstract, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax. One meaningful tightening (crater descent under alarm pressure) supports escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Lira tracks the pilgrim, discovers alignment mechanics, pulls the lever, and the chip assembles. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the frequency hums, the pilgrim says "now we listen," and the story ends on resonance without decision. Cost is conceptual (the unknown) but not viscerally felt or paid on the page; the protagonist receives insight rather than forfeiting something tangible. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (observatory, dusk, Lira's role). One meaningful tightening occurs (lever pull → beam alignment → chip assembly), satisfying the 600–800 word minimum, but the ending diffuses into thematic musing rather than crystallizing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, terrace, dusk) arrive promptly. The piece follows a causal lens: discovering the driftwood carvings → vision of the erased brother → decision to reveal the truth. However, the closure unit—Elias's walk back with his resolve—offers a decision stated in summary ("He would tell her...") rather than a visible, felt cost paid on the page. The final image of him wondering if she'll forgive him reconfigures his stance, but the cost remains projected rather than landed in a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece orients quickly (who/where/when by the first two paragraphs) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara's release of the drawer pull and Elias's retention of his own create a charged final image that reweights "letting go" versus "carrying" with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery and cadence rather than causal reversals—and the closure lands cleanly under that lens. One minor causality slip: the cartographer's innocence is revealed in dialogue after the exchange, undercutting the stakes retroactively rather than dramatizing the friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent—compass and lighthouse recur, pressure deepens through layered reflection, and the ending image (leaving the compass, paddling toward town lights) reweights the opening stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara's refusal to carry the compass forward and her choice to navigate by her own weight of choices forecloses the path of external validation with felt cost. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (coastal launch, dawn, solo). One minor causality slip: the utility poles "shift, their shadows stretching east when they should've pointed west" is unexplained and not paid off—it reads like atmospheric mood rather than a constraint that alters her route, creating a small fissure in spatial logic that does not break closure but weakens mid-escalation credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words (hospital, Mara, post-procedure). A weak Resonant Reconfiguration appears: Mara moves from guilt-haunted blank slate to someone carrying "hope" and a new compass, but the cost is more declared ("holding the pain of others") than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice on the page. The journey structure provides causal linkage (baseball → map → lake → J.T. encounter → vow), yet the climactic lake scene resolves via exposition ("You can still choose them") rather than a choice that narrows Mara's options. The inferred lens is Causal-Hybrid, but the closure leans on told insight rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Lira, orchard, moonlight, phoenix's recent rise) land within the opening. The piece attempts a Causal lens (fortune → ritual → transformation → bond restored), but the central turn—Lira's capitulation to metamorphosis—occurs through passive acceptance ("she did not fight it") rather than a motivated choice that narrows options. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes a bridge), yet the cost remains abstract: no specific ability, relationship, or human connection is named as lost on the page, only a vague shedding of "humanity." The phoenix's reappearance feels summoned by ritual mechanics rather than a because/therefore link to her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers card placements, symbolic objects, and imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—we lack clear spatial anchors and "after the birth" remains vague until late—but the lyric mode teaches this pattern early enough to avoid collapse. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the healed saucer, the mother's handprint on the cloth) with conceptual cost (acceptance that "repentance isn't a place"). However, the saucer's healing and the mother's appearance feel granted rather than earned by prior causality; the tree and nest appear without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore linkage even under an accumulative lens. Cost is legible but the causal path to that cost is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural accents (memory layering, locket ritual). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (ship, role, relic by paragraph two). The closure unit—door opens, garden appears, ship stabilizes—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "shadows coiled...dissolved into light" and "locket shattered" do not foreclose a live option or impose a felt sacrifice tied to Lira's prior choices. The turn is more revelation than renunciation. One meaningful tightening occurs (meditation chamber forces confrontation), but the mechanics of "stitching with words, memories, truth" bypass dramatized struggle. The ending reweights her pacifism conceptually yet the price paid feels summarized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors land clearly within the first 120 words. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the glowing constellation-map and Lira's final acceptance, but the man's prophecy revelation arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal earn. The "complete the prophecy" frame feels externally imposed rather than grown from Lira's prior orchestrations. One meaningful deepening occurs when she releases the supernova bug, but the cost—what path is foreclosed—remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with decent spatial anchors (fort, tower, sundial) but the blackout premise and Council threat remain abstract declarations. The puzzle-sequence (quill holder → sundial → chamber) provides causal linkage, but the stakes never tighten—success arrives without complication or reversal. Closure is a discovery (chamber revealed) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost forecloses a path or crystallizes a stance under pressure. The drive lens reads Causal through the puzzle mechanics, but the ending delivers exposition ("when the lights return, the Council will see") instead of an on-page reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through vision-fragments and rock-placement attempts that reweight the sacred-pattern stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira shifts from "solve" to "witness," the eels form a living sigil, and the star dust settles to a steady pulse. Cost is asserted ("tears mingling with the salt spray," the storm threat receding) but not sharply legible as a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice; the ending image tilts toward affirmation without a felt price that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intensification. The closure—sealing the poem and deciding to mail it—lands on the page as Charged Poise (crystallized stance with cost implicit in "dared print uncensored work"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cartographer's fragment reweights Kael's understanding of his own scars. Cost is felt but not sharply visible: the act of mailing carries social/professional risk, yet the on-page consequence remains oblique rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (atrium, brook, philosophers dueling) and holds spatial coherence. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization: "Now we follow the map"), but the cost is conceptual and thin—no option visibly forecloses, no tactic meaningfully narrows. The lens appears Hybrid-Causal in setup but drifts toward thematic declaration at the end without a decisive pressure point that alters what either character can do next. The tin-card reveal mid-duel offers a micro-turn but does not generate new friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, inferred from the recurring tin motif and the final-image repricing of "bloom through chaos" rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: Cedar's discovery of the new poem reframes his stance from "rebuild" to "grow through the chaos," but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page, only assertion ("he didn't panic"). The tin's return charges the final beat, yet the reweighting feels thematic rather than felt, lacking the undeniable pressure required for high-band Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the arbor's tides, compasses, and broken clock accumulate atmospheric pressure, and the descent into the hidden room offers a spatial shift. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Clara plays, leaves the piano open, and declares she'll "surprise fate back" without a visible path foreclosed or a meaningful renunciation. The film-reel discovery functions as a convenient reveal rather than a turn earned by prior causality. Orientation anchors (tidal arbor, station piano, Clara at the window) arrive cleanly by ~120 words, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The ending image (strings vibrating, compasses spinning) attempts Charged Poise but the stakes and options remain vague, preventing a legible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure arrives as a declared shift ("no longer felt like an ending but a beginning") without on-page cost or changed options—Lira's smile and resolve appear granted rather than earned. The seed vanishes conveniently, erasing the object that might have imposed constraint. The cavern confrontation is told through mirrors and voices rather than dramatized pressure, and the "fracture" resolves via contemplation instead of a causal turn. Orientation is clear early, and the lens reads as accumulative-textural, but the final image lacks undeniable pressure or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (compass leads to ship, lace unlocks the door, apologies dissolve the ghost) but the central mechanism—lace as map of emotions—is introduced and resolved in a single unbroken sequence without meaningful resistance or complication. The closure (mutual apology, vanished ship, calm sea) registers as Decisive Change with felt emotional cost, but the cost is asserted more than shown: we do not see what Lira or the father forfeit by this reconciliation. Orientation is clean; the islet, studio, and sea are anchored early. One small fracture: the compass "points to memories" but later "led them to a shipwreck"—the causal link between memory-direction and physical location is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Elara's realization reweights time's meaning with cost (the inert halo fragment and lost visions). Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the garden's reformation serving as a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, leading to a decisive change closure where Lirael unchains herself and activates the seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive lens holds tightly from inciting incident to closure, with clear orientation early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lila embraces vulnerability, legible in the final café scene with cost felt in her readiness. The seashell and notes create persistent constraints that shape tactics, and no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in the shedding flakes and darkness, reconfiguring the meaning of silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with patterns of silence deepening toward the end. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens is consistent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a decisive change in Unit-17's understanding, supported by a Hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative). Cost is legible in the robot's transformed role, and orientation is clear early. The violin's introduction is slightly convenient but integrated without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when Elias doodles the lens instead of writing, reconfiguring his role. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns of tickets, lens, and crystals. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics. Cost is legible in "he wrote nothing."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Plot follows a causal lens with strong because/therefore linkages, from discovering symbols to the closure promise. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost legible in the timpani's approval and Clara's whispered vow, reconfiguring options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)

The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraints like the station's instability shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)

    The structure is accumulative: flood → dust observation → chrysalis study → institutional conflict → symposium and botanist exchange, which together reconfigure her trajectory. Causality stays clean—each scientific curiosity leads to a new observational project and then to social consequence (colleagues’ confusion, public talk). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she chooses to stand by the greenhouse work and finds a new collaborative path, with reputational risk implied as the cost. Stakes remain mostly professional/internal rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: survival → ledger → frost patterns → crevice → shard → star map/name → redefined purpose, all within a legible single-POV window. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence, and the piece lands a clear Conceptual Repricing closure as she decides how her art will change. The magical-realism elements (frost-map mimicry, holographic shard) arrive without friction and serve the structure, though they solve problems rather quickly, limiting felt difficulty. Still, the story’s spine holds under a mostly causal lens with an accumulative textural overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline—trauma → experiment → Elias’s arrival → breakthrough tone → lullaby composition → wider adoption—is clear and coherent, with a legible before/after reconfiguration at the end. Closure functions as a resonant repricing: Lirael’s relationship to silence shifts from punishment to chosen language, with the conservatory and tuning forks reweighted in the final image. However, major developments (word spreading, concert hall performances) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the climax’s immediacy and cost. The piece leans partly accumulative in texture, and that mode is held consistently enough that the quiet, reflective ending feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—from package to dream to journey to repair to activation—is coherent and easy to follow, and the story delivers a clear before/after closure (Elias’s role and the city’s status both change). The structure compresses vast spans (“for days,” “years later”) into summary, which keeps stakes from tightening in the middle and makes the final life-choice feel more reported than lived. Still, closure lands cleanly under a largely causal drive with a touch of conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: sanctions → anonymous donations → Mira’s investigation → the public bell ceremony → the shift from goods to notes → long-term change. The solstice bell-ringing functions as a decisive structural hinge with legible before/after. Some middle beats (her tracing the network, the council debates) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens tension but doesn’t break coherence. Closure lands clearly with a resonant reconfiguration of how the community relates to itself and to sanctions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and causal: viaduct → ingesting Kwan Yin’s Tear → altered perception → following the light trail → pool revelation → return. As an accumulative/textural piece, it builds toward a conceptual repricing of what “unused love” is, and that closure is legible. However, the lack of obstacles or reversals keeps the arc from feeling like a true progression under pressure; each step yields exactly what she needs at first try. The cost of her realization is very soft, more contemplative than consequential, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense experiment → activation of the fragment → collapse/disintegration → reformation with reweighted terms, all under a single POV in one evolving scene. Cause and effect are clear (fragment interacts with garden/photos → visions and geometric distortion → collapse → new equilibrium), and the closure is a conceptual repricing with visible shifts in world state and cost (lost visions, inert fragment). The only softness is how quickly the reformation resolves the near-catastrophic breakdown without more on-page negotiation or risk. Still, the arc feels coherent and satisfyingly closed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: encoded location → piano bench/arrow code → opening the vault → scavengers closing in → seeds used to stop them and begin healing the world. The structure is essentially linear with one temporal blur at the start (“days, maybe weeks”), but orientation (who/where/what’s at stake) is solid early on. Closure is decisive and on-page: she opens the vault, secures a vial, breaks her chains, and uses the seeds against the scavengers at real cost/risk. The only limitation is that obstacles resolve quickly and somewhat smoothly once she has the vial, so escalation feels a bit compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: enter greenhouse with a clear mission → assemble absences → discover the need for something “sharper” → root from the dead tree → forging the hearing aid and using it. Closure works as a Decisive Change and mild Conceptual Repricing: she literally manufactures the sound of betrayal and chooses to inhabit it, changing her perceptual world. The structure is a single, coherent scene with integrated backstory that all reorients back to the current task. The only limitation is that the emotional and tactical difficulty of success feels modest; nothing seriously threatens failure or forces a hard trade-off beyond discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: preparation, infiltration, magical test, offering, and exit all follow a coherent heist structure within a single, well-contained scene. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable, and the magical rule—light demanding an offering—is introduced and paid off without contradiction. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to “stolen moments” conceptually shifts when the jar illuminates rather than consumes the photograph. The main structural weakness is that the central test feels too smoothly passed, with little sense that failure is a live possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clear: Kael searches the control room → engages in reflective play with narration and the bookmark → the thaw reveals the compartment and schematics → the discovery reorients his stance. Causality is light but intact (melting ice and persistent tinkering lead to the schematic), and the closure (choosing to abandon perfect answers in favor of embracing cracks) lands on the page. The drive feels mostly accumulative/textural with a small causal turn at the hidden compartment. Stakes never tighten sharply, so the decisive change is more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: the shell draws her to the library, the decrypted notes expose the heirloom’s significance, the enforcer confrontation forces her escape, and the off-page confession resolves the mob plot. Structure-wise, the two-shard design (library, then café weeks later) is legible and closes the arc with a before/after. Yet the resolution is somewhat convenient—the enforcer’s swift confession and the mob boss’s arrest happen off-screen with little cost—which blunts the impact of the setup. Closure is present and coherent but not maximally earned for a “prestige” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is simple and coherent: arrive in the hush after the storm, consult the booklet, undertake the drawing, land on the glowing map as closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure is the deepening of silence and the star-dimming clock, leading to a Charged Poise ending when the last star goes out. Causality is intact and orientation is excellent, but the decisive change is modest and low-cost. The sense of “before/after” exists yet feels more conceptual than dramatically compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: procedure → curiosity → anomalous violin → time-loop experience → synthesized understanding, with a clear before/after in Unit-17’s stance. The temporal mechanics are hand-wavy but consistent enough for the fable-like mode, and the courtyard visions are a legible middle escalation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Unit-17 resumes sweeping but with reconfigured understanding and role. Cost is mostly conceptual (bearing the weight of self-awareness) rather than dramatized as a difficult choice, which slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: odd ticket → lens → hidden message → meeting → decoding → redefined role. Structure is linear, well-oriented, and fits a single-scene-plus-walk scope without confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias abandons logging words in favor of interpreting silence. The main weakness is the soft sense of cost—his old life and its implications are relinquished without friction or concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear and coherent: Elara’s routine, the challenge from Joren, the demonstration, and his partial conversion form a tidy arc. Causality is intact—her choice to act by intuition (e.g., blocking the sensor) leads to the maze’s response and Joren’s shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and while conceptually satisfying, the lack of a concrete, costly turn keeps it from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clean: calibrate → destabilize → crisis with alien creatures → recalibration → renewed resolve, with no orientation issues. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the experiment worked and nearly failed, yet Veyra chooses to push further, but the cost is conceptual more than truly dramatized. Stakes remain mostly at the level of “scientific success vs. lab mishap,” with little sense of lasting consequence if she had failed. That keeps the structure solid but short of the charged, costly closure expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear causal chain (ghost-obsessed musician investigates → water activates program → symbols appear → vow to complete the work). The drive reads as a Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with tension accruing via atmosphere and revelation rather than big events. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Clara exits with the code mentally and physically held, options and stakes reweighted toward finishing the symphony. The main limitation is that the cost of this decision and its concrete future consequences remain mostly implied rather than sharply etched on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: fever → unease/glitches → discovery of “QUARANTINE” file → decision to leave and hand over the illustration, with clear causal steps. The closure is a decisive change (abandoning her post) and a conceptual repricing of “fault-tolerance” and truth, with a legible before/after. The drive is largely accumulative/textural but supported by enough causality that the ending feels earned. The external stakes (station’s potential failure) stay mostly conceptual rather than tested in-scene, which slightly mutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: rumor → tunnel → valve in intake → shaft opening → chamber activation → holographic revelation → exit with reconfigured understanding. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, what he wants) and the piece maintains a single continuous scene with one clear transition (tunnel to chamber). Closure is solid: the revealed cover-up and Elias’s changed stance toward the truth and the valve itself provide a credible before/after. The only limit is that the machine’s danger never fully materializes in a way that complicates his options, keeping the structural stakes slightly conceptual rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric lens: each fold leads to a concrete new space and deeper quiet, culminating in the refuge and a reconfigured return. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early and never lost, and the piece maintains a single POV and throughline. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s stance toward the library and reality has shifted, with the river sealed away. The main limitation is that the journey encounters little genuine resistance, so turns feel like steps on a path rather than pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is simple but solid: arrival, musical/ritual setup, glow event, and a closing transfer of the curl, all bracketed by the eclipse arc. Causality is clean under an accumulative lens—Elara’s invitation and framing lead to Mara’s participation; remembering triggers the glow; this reconfigures Mara’s stance enough that she keeps the curl. Closure (Mara accepting and pocketing the curl as a reminder) lands as a quiet but legible reconfiguration. The cost is subtle (emotional vulnerability, surrender of skepticism) and slightly underlined rather than dramatized, keeping this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain (searching the ashes → discovering tapestry and pages → decoding symbols → realizing the axis is attention → stories awakening) within one continuous scene. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: the “last human dream” is reframed as neglect rather than disappearance, and Elias’s recognition restores the displaced axis. The cost is subtle but present as a heavy responsibility—he becomes the listener that reanimates a chorus of ghosts. Structure is tight and legible, though the stakes never quite sharpen into a dilemma or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: lighthouse routine → restlessness → following the microdot map → letters reveal the network → she decides to continue the work and targets the dockworker. The structure (present action bracketed around a single foray into the safehouse) is legible and well-contained, and the closure beat—her initiating a new “flow”—lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise hybrid. The main weakness is that the cost of this decision remains largely conceptual, not dramatized; the “flood” danger is warned but not felt. Still, for this length, the story offers a coherent arc with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each new loop and rhetorical turn further destabilizes the anchor, leading causally to cracks, void, and disintegration. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal throughline) holds throughout, and closure lands with a clear before/after: stabilized dimensions vs. a flux state where possession cannot complete. The cost is conceptual but legible—the anchor is destroyed and reality is left in a precarious equilibrium. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative lyric: orientation is immediate, and the nautilus/mirrored horizon pattern is taught early and paid off at closure. Causality is soft but coherent—each step from shell to memories to fortunes to final “symphony” follows an intelligible emotional logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she recommits to her role and crystallizes what the fortunes truly are to her. The main limitation is the relatively modest cost; the “before exhaustion hits” clock never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: viaduct → first arch choice → montage of alternate lives → convergence and grounded ending, with a coherent causal drive toward self-integration. Closure is solid—she literally and metaphorically descends, tablet destroyed once its function is fulfilled. Still, many crucial turns (the tour through variants, how each choice reconfigures her options) are summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation feels somewhat schematic instead of lived. World mechanics (how the tablet and arches actually operate) remain vague but don’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: discovery of the cavern → experiment with the filament of hush → spreading it to others → return to a charged quiet at the end. Causality is clean (broken needle → copper wire → reversed records → new experience of feeling), and time moves legibly even with the “Days passed” compression. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: silence and the broken needle are conceptually re-priced, and her options for living with numbness are meaningfully altered. The cost—reopening herself to feeling and pain—is implied rather than sharply dramatized, so the climax reads more gentle than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: pigeon → note → maps → rooftop survey → entry into the zone → clinic revelation → vial → return and new log. Orientation is strong from the courtyard opening, and the closure—a decisively altered stance and new log entry—is legible with a before/after. The main structural weakness is that the most dangerous step (getting the vial to the press) is elided, softening on-page cost without breaking coherence. Overall, the piece holds a solid causal lens with a clear, contained arc.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: introduction of Lirael and her unease, introduction of the vial and UV method, the experiment, the memory-vision, and a reoriented walk home. Causality is legible and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each step arising from the previous one. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of grief and her sensitivity, and the before/after stance is clear with a modest felt cost. The main limitation is that the “riskiness” of the method is asserted but never dramatized, so the sense of danger in the middle act is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: follow the lights → encounter grotto/being → be offered a choice about the rope → choose to unravel → see the reconfigured pattern on the floor. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: the “texture of time” is redefined through the final spiral and single thread, with a felt cost in the memories released. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid very early, and the story maintains one continuous scene. The main ceiling is that the external stakes remain modest and largely contemplative, even if emotionally pointed.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: we move from set-up (greenhouse, bowl legend, bonfire ritual) to experiment, revelation, and communal response in one continuous scene. Causality holds: her dissatisfaction with the traditional silence motivates the experiment with the bowl, which in turn produces a new understanding and altered communal behavior. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where “silence” is conceptually repriced as “potential.” The cost is quiet but present in the relinquishing of the old memorial mode for a more vulnerable, participatory one.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal arc is clean: environment calibration → client arrival → request to forget → offer with clearly stated price → test → acceptance → Elias resets to readiness. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and closure lands as an earned stasis where his practice continues under the same ethic. However, the cost of Lira’s choice (surrendering part of her joy) remains conceptual rather than dramatized, which softens the impact of the final beat. The transformation of the grotto at dusk sets a temporal frame but doesn’t meaningfully alter options or tactics beyond ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: symphony → library → stray envelope → boardinghouse clue → recognition of the girl → forged letter → later postcard and ledger motif. Structure-wise, this is a compact causal arc with a clear before/after in Clara’s worldview, culminating in the “Profit, Unseen” and postcard beat as closure (a conceptual repricing). The coincidence of the mistaken address is accepted as premise but not used to handwave tension; Clara’s choice to pursue it drives the story. The cost at closure is subtle—she changes her metric of value rather than paying a sharp price—which keeps this short of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Kael’s decision to dedicate his project → study of tags → conversation with Lira → following the angles → discovery of the timed mural → meeting Lira-as-Veyra. The piece adheres to a simple quest structure that closes neatly with the reveal and shared stance beneath the arbor, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Stakes remain small and personal, but the before/after in his isolation is clear and paid off. There are no orientation or lens issues; the accumulative texture supports a predominantly causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: canals “breathing” → fissure and voice → decision to twist pendant → tunnel vision → re-emergence with new understanding and renewed commitment. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds through closure. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of time and the giant’s role, plus Lila’s resolved stance to “uncage time once more.” The main limitation is that the on-page cost of this arc is more conceptual than dramatically felt, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure—single scene framed by a few tightly anchored memories—reads as a clean accumulative build where the ritual deepens rather than reconfigures the situation. Causality is coherent: she aligns eyes to cracks, adds sap, resonance builds, the mosaic shifts, and this triggers re-interpretation of her brother’s message. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: loss re-understood as fractal and alive, with a before/after stance on preservation. Stakes and cost stay modestly scaled but legible, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: tape fragment → intensifying sense memory → choice to follow pipe chases → discovery of decoder → message that reframes her role. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the single POV window is coherent. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she caches the decoder and repositions herself internally as a messenger for the hidden. The main structural softness is the somewhat convenient appearance of a perfectly labeled “Project Lumen—Decoder” just where she emerges, with minimal resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: trellis → greenhouse incident → night reflection → morning reconfiguration, with clear causal threads. The hellebore’s retraction and Eleanor’s choice not to interfere form the central hinge that reweights everything that follows. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “control” vs. “sustaining transformation,” and it’s on the page. Stakes remain largely internal and modest, but the throughline is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story tracks cleanly: insomnia and blocked canvas → following rain → discovery of brooch and stranger → exchange → transformative painting → conceptual reframe in the morning. The causal chain is intact under a hybrid/accumulative lens, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing around meaning as conversation) is legible with a before/after. Cost is quiet but present: she relinquishes her prior stance of combative “threshing” in favor of vulnerability to an ongoing, uncontrollable “conversation.” Structure stays within a single, continuous arc with one temporal step to “next morning,” which is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: strange arrival → offer of the pearl → choice to accept → destructive transformation → new equilibrium, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to magic and the cave’s song is permanently altered, with clear on-page cost (shattered crystals, dark thread in the magic). The structure is tight for a single-scene piece, with each beat arising from the last rather than feeling modular. The only limitation is that the pilgrim’s motives remain deliberately opaque, keeping the conflict slightly more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure—a three-site mosaic (cottage, quay, plaza) tied together by the valve and the exile—reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is sound if gentle: each placement of the valve invites a new fragment and moves toward reassembly of the trumpet. Closure is present but low-cost: the harbor gains a restored symbol without any hard on-page sacrifice or real risk that the quest might fail. The piece leans heavily on summary across days, which blunts the sense of live turns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: cracks/arrows → hidden wall → staircase → chamber → hologram/figure → ticket/map. The structure fits a single continuous descent with a clear closure in the reconfigured map and his new readiness to “begin.” However, the stakes of failure or refusal remain abstract, so the decisive change is more conceptual than felt. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with a thematic overlay and holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: tower retreat → discovery of tile → vision → informed choice to transcribe → crescendo of memories → post-transcription reconfiguration. The piece operates under a largely causal lens with accumulative textural support from the whales and setting, and closure lands in Clara’s softened skepticism and new relationship to the tile. Stakes remain mostly internal but coherent, and the sequence never loses orientation in time or space. The cost at closure is subtle (she yields some certainty for wonder) yet legible, appropriate to the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → spatial warping → shard behavior → Lira’s appearance → joint choice → shattering/escape, with no major orientation issues. The closure is a decisive change—Kael and Lira break the loop and leave the escondite—with a legible risk of the unknown. The ease of the solution (“we have to let go together”) feels slightly convenient, with little resistance once explained, softening the sense of cost. Still, for this length, the structure is tight and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causality is straightforward: eavesdropping → reveal → confrontation → negotiation → exit, and the drive lens is clearly causal. The major flaw is that the pivotal hour-long negotiation is summarized in a single sentence (“For the next hour, Elara waited actively...”), so the decisive change—trading math for asylum and systemic reform—lands as unearned and implausibly easy. Closure exists (she leaves with asylum papers and a new mandate), but the cost and resistance are barely dramatized. This weakens the felt before/after despite a clean structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is essentially one soft scene with light reflection: establish routine, introduce the lamp hum intensifying, then return to a stable pattern. The moment when the hum syncs with her breathing hints at a turn, but nothing in her options, circumstances, or knowledge materially reconfigures beyond “the stories feel even more vivid.” Closure is more reiterative than transformative—she persists as she has, with an added flourish of external validation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density rises but the final beat doesn’t clearly impose a new cost or charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear: story-collecting → overheard rumor → trunk of letters → storm and rising tide → skeleton and locket → realization of erasure → vow to pursue the conspiracy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the man who thought he was Kael Voss understands he is Marcus Hale and reframes all prior fragments as evidence. The drive lens is primarily causal with some accumulative texturing, and it holds. The skeleton-with-locket coincidence in the storm is a bit convenient, softening the sense that the climax arises from his prior tactics rather than authorial placement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: discover artifacts → reconstruct backstory → conduct experiment → observatory responds → realization and departure, all in one continuous causal chain. The closure is legible: the experiment advances the clock to midnight and yields the glowing note, which reconfigures Lira’s stance from decoding to feeling. Setups (dials stuck at 11:59, shell’s properties, cello) pay off without stray threads or rule-breaking. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, but within that scale the causal design is tight and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is quick and clean, and the causal chain—graffiti insight → organized campaign → Council confrontation → temporary reprieve—reads straightforwardly. The closure qualifies as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the Council retreats “for now,” preserving the carnival at least temporarily and clarifying the ongoing fight. However, the confrontation resolves with relative ease and little visible cost beyond tension, so the before/after line feels conceptually more than dramatically weighted. The drive lens reads predominantly causal with a situational flavor and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single main scene on the summit with a tight clock, then a brief epilogue-like shard years later that reframes the act. Causality holds—her preparation leads to the dawn dissolution, which leads to the photo and, later, the archivist’s discovery; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the message is indeed received. Stakes are modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the ending beats land with conceptual cost (her work likely forgotten, yet not quite). It’s well-built and publishable, though the narrative never risks a structural surprise or a sharper turn.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged drone → diagnosis via water → repair and recalibration → confirmation as the ship launches. The piece reads under a largely causal lens with a quiet Earned Stasis/RR closure as Lira returns to her bench and ongoing work. However, the stakes around the launch and potential failure of the drones remain low-tension; the repair unfolds smoothly without a meaningful setback, ambiguity, or cost. Structure is solid and complete, but the arc feels more like a pleasant technical vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: falcon returns → strange map → Clara chooses to investigate → discovery of light-rivers → later repercussion and reflection back at the outpost. Structure moves from inciting incident to expedition to conceptual repricing at the end with no orientation issues. Closure is solidly a resonant reconfiguration/ conceptual repricing—Clara’s understanding of maps and rivers shifts, and the world’s epistemic stakes reweight. The main weakness is how frictionless the central discovery feels; obstacles arise more by summary than on-page turns, which keeps escalation but mutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: Kael arrives, applies his method, the town responds in stages, and he exits once balance returns. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens—repeated fork strikes and passing days deepen the transformation from ghost town to living square. Closure is solid: the town’s state is decisively reconfigured, and Kael’s departure crystallizes the before/after. The main limitation is the relatively low on-page cost; everything works almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: stranded researcher → vial as key → descent into temple heart → revelation of the vault’s true nature → decision to release the hush. Closure lands with a decisive change and conceptual repricing: she abandons the priests’ impulse to imprison memory, accepts the cost (lost secrets, psychic ordeal), and surfaces reoriented. Stakes (time before storm, risk of unleashing trapped grief) are legible, though the external consequences of failure remain somewhat abstract. Structure is linear and coherent for this length, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline—Elias enters the prison with the lattice, confronts ghost and double, reaches the chamber, and emerges changed—is coherent and cleanly sequenced. The hybrid causal/accumulative structure works: the labyrinth’s shifting, the blooming lattice, and the final chamber all build toward a reconfiguration of his role in the “story.” However, the declared external clock (“before they found the bodies”) never truly constrains his decisions, and the world rules (how scuffs reshape walls, how the magic operates) stay pleasantly vague rather than sharply dramatized. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of his self-concept, but the felt cost of that change is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: the ghost’s gifts → Elara’s experiment with bead and fruit → resonant awakening → release and dawn, with a clean before/after in both characters and world. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (centuries of imprisonment, the relinquishing of a curse), and the structure holds a single dominant drive. However, Elara’s decisive act—pressing bead to fruit—arrives with limited on-page reasoning or alternatives, so the climax feels slightly too convenient and puzzle-solved. The backstory block is substantial but anchored to present action and doesn’t fracture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: Lira enters the labyrinth, follows her technique, reaches the heart, and restores it through a clear sequence of actions. Closure is solid—by the end, the labyrinth has shifted from ruin to hymn and the tide pools mirror that change—but the path feels almost frictionless, with no real setbacks or turns. The accumulative/lyric drive is coherent, yet the ease of success slightly undercuts the sense of cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: return → discovery of tomb → placement of sundial → waiting/rebuilding → activation → villagers’ arrival, which gives solid structure at this length. The global drive reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural layer, and closure is a Decisive Change in Lirael’s stance toward faith plus the shrine’s activation. Cost is somewhat soft—more implied responsibility and emotional weight than dramatized loss—but it’s legible in her decision to commit and in the unfinished-yet-public state of the shrine. No orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: chalk analysis → partial message → carrier’s arrival with matching pseudonym → margin code pointing to the fountain → discovery of the chip → revelation of the grandmother’s role and the resistance. The piece uses a predominantly causal drive, with each clue logically leading to the next, and the final hologram clearly reconfigures Lira’s options and sense of self. Closure is solid—a decisive change in knowledge and mission with a felt emotional cost and new responsibility. The pressure is somewhat gentle, but structurally the story holds together with no major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous scene with clear causal chaining (news of the telescopes → move the flame → revelation via embroidery). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the candle and embroidery’s role in synchronizing hidden truth becomes explicit. However, the “coup” and its consequences remain offstage, so the final reconfiguration is more intellectual than operational, with limited felt cost or narrowing of options. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative and holds consistently, but the global stakes never quite bite into the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clear, single-arc ritual: arrival → invocation → manifestation → dawn departure, with a coherent accumulative drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes her relationship to unsent words and leaves under altered inner terms. Causality is intact but gentle—the ritual works on the first try, and there are no real setbacks or complicating turns. The cost of change is more conceptual than dramatized, keeping the piece short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present in the atrium, reflection on the reef and aquarium, then a forward jump to the resumed talks and a quiet return to the atrium. Causality is soft but legible—reading the cast’s “codes” leads to her reframing translation, which leads to the coral gesture at the table and a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what translation and ruin mean, with a modest emotional cost. The anesthetic and collapsed talks feel more like framing than active structural constraints, slightly blunting the sense of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the fragment → decision to mount a public display → use of the knowledge network → communal gathering → reconfigured relationship to the orchard. The story operates under a largely accumulative/textural lens, but the cause-and-effect remains legible and consistent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the district’s status and Lira’s stance are explicitly “before/after” reweighted, with her planning a bigger, louder mural. The cost—her emotional exposure and the risk of challenging the fog’s “monopoly on memory”—is implicit but perceptible rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear: long-term experiments → today’s alignment of frequencies → the mural’s awakening → the nested memory/ancestral connection → re-seeing the mural. The piece follows a single continuous scene with a clean beginning (setup of garden/coin), middle (activation and revelations), and end (reconfiguration of meaning). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marisol reconceives awakening as an ongoing rhythm and the garden as a “state of mind,” with her future stance altered. Stakes, however, remain low and almost entirely conceptual, which keeps the structural success from feeling urgent or high-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: Elias seeks access → passes Lillian’s test → enters the club → executes the glowing garden, and the shift from greenhouse to garden gives a neat two-shard structure. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and the drive lens (causal with some accumulative texture) holds to the end. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city now visibly hosts their resistance code, with news coverage confirming impact. The main limitation is the light sense of cost or danger; nothing disrupts or truly threatens his trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: postcard → outward venture → disseminated poems → moss bloom → seed → tree → altered relation to insomnia. Causality is clear enough within a magical-lyric frame, and the closure (a new stasis where she can sleep and sing) reads as an earned reconfiguration with conceptual cost after centuries of vigilance. The migration motif and time jumps are coherent and don’t cause orientation debt, but many beats glide past without friction, making the arc feel a bit too effortless. Still, the before/after in her stance is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: storm damage → irreplaceable tube → Lirael’s refusal of “cannot be repaired” → experimental repair via song → reconfigured harmony and understanding of preservation. The single-scene structure with a light descent into the museum’s depths at the end is coherent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the rules of “preservation” are conceptually repriced. Cost is present but subtle—risk of destabilizing extinct feelings is invoked but never fully bites on the page, keeping escalation modest. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure and pattern pay off clearly at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s archival work leads to insight about promises, which in turn reframes her estrangement and culminates in the decision to call Mira. The structure—initial linguistic puzzle, curator’s challenge, sister-manuscript, then phone call—has a clear tightening and a decisive on-page change. Stakes remain modestly scaled and the obstacles are mostly intellectual/emotional rather than situational, so escalation never feels urgent in a visceral sense. Nonetheless, closure is solid and the before/after state is legible with real emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with a clear throughline from arriving with the envelope to decoding it and internalizing the message. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands in the act of reading the confession and reweighting her task as moral as well as technical. Still, the piece lacks a strong on-page turn where failure or misinterpretation feels like a live possibility, so the arc reads more like an elegant demonstration than a pressured progression. The volcano/floodgate stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean from the outset: we know who Elias is, where he is, and what object matters. The causal chain is clear—arrival of the chip and note → obsession with decoding (dust + song + symbols) → discovery in the ledger → dream insight → decision to visit Voss. The “weeks passed” montage works at this length but slightly diffuses pressure, with the decoding process feeling more like a mood-swell than a sequence of tightening choices. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: he redefines his role from courier to “son,” with implied cost but limited on-page friction around leaving his current life.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: Lira arrives on the terrace, interprets codes and grain, descends into the maze, reaches the heart, writes a new code, and chooses to step through the door—closure is a clear Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative/textural lens: environmental shifts (prisms aligning) and her interpretive choices open options rather than coincidences resolving them. The stakes are modestly scaled but legible (reconciling with her father/maze and claiming her own language of codes), and the cost is implied in the acceptance that sacred thresholds can’t be revisited. A slightly more concrete sense of what she risks by entering or not entering the light-door would sharpen the causal pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: waiting → faint shifts → full alignment → reflective comedown, all in one continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara reframes belonging in light of the luminous respite, with a clear before/after in her stance. Causality is soft but consistent—nothing breaks logic—but the lack of a sharper hinge or cost at the climax keeps the structure from feeling indispensable rather than simply graceful. The reflective passages are anchored in present action and do not blur orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: bird → seeds → runes → crater glass interaction → pool of light → realization about paths being released. The piece follows a single, clear throughline with one main tightening when she decides to take shard and seeds to the geode’s heart. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the governing rule of the world (disappearance as forgetting) is revised to disappearance as release, with a legible before/after. The cost of that repricing is implied more than dramatized, so while the structure is solid and publishable-level, it doesn’t quite reach the most powerful end of the spectrum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is legible: Lira chooses the spot and musical pattern, the discord note and fountain flare shift the crowd, and the final silence/applause sequence closes the arc. Structure is cleanly one scene with an identifiable tightening around the discord and frozen moment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she proves her approach works and the crowd’s behavior validates her—but the stakes are small and the cost faint. There are no significant orientation issues or causality breaks, just a relatively safe arc.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: she comes to the garden to renew her skin, uses the stolen dust to catalyze the fledge, then escalates to the forbidden act of writing the verse, leading to an earned stasis where the ban holds but her stance shifts. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and the closure image (exile in the in‑between, verse fading by dawn) provides a clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, but the risk of madness and the theft from the Archive give some concrete pressure. A slightly sharper sense of what failure would look like on the page (beyond hollow yearning) would strengthen the plot’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: she goes to the bay, performs a ritual, experiences a realization, and leaves. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds atmosphere rather than causal tension, and closure arrives as a quiet conceptual shift. However, the “before everything shifted” frame sets up an off-page crisis that never exerts real pressure on the on-page moment, blunting potential structural charge. The decisive before/after is more implied than felt, so the closure reads modest rather than powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ascent, the opening of the box as focal beat, and a closure that reconfigures his relationship to fire, time, and guilt. Causality is simple but coherent—he goes up the ridge to open the box, the hourglass triggers memory and realization, and he descends altered. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a quiet internal turn rather than a strong causal reversal. Closure lands conceptually, but the felt cost of the change—what he’s giving up by releasing his self-punishing stance—could be more sharply dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive in grotto → prepare trial balloon → launch → altered perception and realization → departure, with each phase causally linked. The piece reads primarily under an accumulative/textural lens, with pattern-building leading to the conceptual reveal that the grotto is a crossroads and her balloons are bridges. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the “before” (uncertain experimenter) and “after” (someone who understands the grotto’s role and her own method) are legible. The main soft spot is the lack of any serious complication or near-failure in the experiment, which keeps the arc very smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: exploration → discovery of diaries → wall’s groan/shifting → alcove/locket → conceptual reweighting at the end. Causality is mostly accumulative rather than strongly driven by external plot, but the sequence feels coherent and each beat leads organically to the next. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Lira sacrifices the negative, discovers the locket, and reinterprets herself as “the map,” clearly marking a before/after. The cost is quieter and largely conceptual, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual-like scene building through three mirrors, interrupted by the bells, then a quiet settling. Causality is modest but coherent (song → mirrors respond → bells disrupt → she finishes anyway); the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she has spent something irretrievable and accepts a belief in unseen consequences. Cost and stakes at the end are present but somewhat soft-focused, limiting impact at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece tracks cleanly from dawn arrival through negotiations to treaty signing, with a coherent causal day-long arc and a clear before/after: talks at risk vs. an imperfect peace achieved. The closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elara secures the treaty but recognizes its incompleteness and her ongoing burden. However, most of the negotiation beats are summarized, with little on-page specificity about turning points in the talks, which softens a sense of concrete escalation and cost. Still, the structure is controlled, orientation is excellent, and the ending reconfigures the opening images with a clear sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: dam → drought → salt flat ritual → storm erasure → later hauntings form a coherent causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the act of release and the egg’s erasure reweight his lifelong project from preservation to curated echo, with the resort plan underscoring the cost. The time jump to the mansion and backstory of funding destruction are well integrated and don’t confuse orientation. Escalation is quiet but legible, so the piece feels complete at the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear sequence (approach → dance/unravel → unlocking → entry and exit) and a legible before/after. Causality is straightforward—her dance untangles threads, which unlock the sanctuary, which yields echoes—and there are no orientation issues. Closure is present but the cost of success feels light and largely effort-based, so the final reconfiguration lands more as quiet fulfillment than as a hard-won, high-stakes shift. The accumulative/lyric lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal spine is clear: Elias comes to the dome to test a method, performs, faces pushback, adapts, and leaves with a refined stance on ethical storytelling. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a brief, well-anchored backstory insertion; orientation and temporal flow are never in doubt. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: storytelling as campfire with flickering, half-lit truths, and Elias committing to this approach. The main limitation is that the decisive change remains mostly conceptual and gently articulated, with only a soft sense of cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation (sanctuary, wing), ritual construction (silk lattice), visitation (monarch’s arrival and contact), and repriced aftermath (her affirmed purpose). Causality is straightforward but solid under a textural lens: because she has built this signal today of all days, the monarch’s landing gains weight and reconfigures her sense of vocation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—she commits to returning and repeating this humble labor with renewed meaning. The cost is subtle but legible (years of waiting, silence, physical minutiae), suited to a quiet short piece, though the stakes never threaten to destabilize her in a deeper way.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: Kael arrives with an object and a plan, executes the ritual, and achieves a charged result, all in one coherent scene. Orientation (who/where/what) is secure early, and the method—reconfiguring the rope to match the card—is legible and followed through. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the past becomes briefly present, and the forgotten are re-lit with cost in effort and exposure. The main limitation is how smoothly the ritual succeeds; there’s little sense of real risk that would threaten the outcome or force a changed tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: storm → activation of the seal → holographic revelation → dream sequence → dawn departure, with a brief “years later” coda that consolidates the repricing of her role. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each step deepens her understanding rather than creating sharp reversals. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Mara reframes the directive and her purpose, then leaves the bunker with a new stance. The main limitation is that the stakes of this change are largely conceptual rather than materially pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → discovery of tile → decoding schematic → opening chamber → aligning tiles → covenant realization → exit. Structure is tight and linear, with one central throughline and no orientation issues, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing—what changes is her understanding of “covenant” and “unknown.” The main weakness is that while the steps escalate in spectacle, the felt stakes remain relatively cerebral; nothing seriously threatens her materially or emotionally in the present. Still, for this length and mode, the drive and closure are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure—a present-time ritual with a sequence of visitors culminating in the harder case of Kael—is clear and coherent, with clean causal links (ritual → pin transformation → internal shift). The drive lens reads as primarily Situational, with the sanctuary as a fixed crucible and each visitor testing Lirael’s method until the final, slightly tougher test. Closure lands: Kael’s partial release and departure with the pin marks a before/after in both his stance and Lirael’s experiment. The montage approach flattens some pressure but does not break causality or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: stranger arrives with need → Elias proposes repurposing the sextant → collaborative ritual → path opens → aftermath reconfigures Elias’s understanding. The story maintains a single coherent scene with a brief excursion as the stranger departs, and the closure (Elias recognizing navigation rather than erasure as the true task) lands as a conceptual repricing. The cost is subtle—Elias lets the stranger go into danger and accepts an ongoing, open-ended duty—but it is present on the page. Escalation is more procedural than pressured, but structurally the piece is sound and publishable with light refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is simple but coherent: breach → Lira stays → mending the eye triggers the orchard’s renewal, closing with her renewed commitment to persist. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural, with the orchard’s transformation serving as a clear resonant reconfiguration of her situation and vow. There is no real structural confusion; the backstory is well anchored in present action and doesn’t break the frame. Cost is somewhat underplayed (the patrons’ departure and her lonely persistence are sketched more than dramatized), which keeps this short of top-tier closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: letter → arrival at orchard → cameo anomaly → grotto vision → map → tree → fusion/legacy. The structure is cleanly two-sharded (orchard then grotto/vision) with a coherent throughline and a legible conceptual reconfiguration at the end (legacy by choice). Closure lands: the act of fusing the cameo into the tree marks a before/after in her status with the legacy. The main weakness is the light sense of cost or constraint on this path, which keeps the final turn from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s arrival → diary + “renegotiate” → journey into the bookstore → guardian’s test → decoding “Silence” → entry to the Library with Kael. Structure stays within a single throughline and the closure (gaining entry under new terms) is legible and earned. However, the key middle turn—Elara intuiting the tactile solution via the orchid and childhood melody—feels a bit quick and convenient for the setup, with little sense that failure was a live possibility. The cost of renegotiation (what she’s truly risking or forfeiting) is conceptually implied but not concretely dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: journal clues → calliope music → hidden door → seed and card → garden → naming, with a clear before/after in leaving the ship. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: they move from searching for a mythic place to instituting themselves within it. However, problem-solving feels almost frictionless once the staircase appears; no attempt meaningfully fails or complicates the path. The result is structurally coherent but somewhat under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: summoned → investigates door → links seal/rope/symbols → reconfigures braids → enters chamber → reads scroll → returns altered in understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the world’s rules (and Elara’s role) are reweighted when the scroll reframes “fables of absence” as instructions and the light beam punctuates that shift. Cost is somewhat soft—she seems to lose nothing tangible, and the door’s reset feels more like a magical flourish than a price paid. Still, for this length, the single arc is coherent and structurally sound with no orientation or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean and legible: disruption by energy beings → attempt via ice/stone/spiral → conjuration → restoration. Causality is sound under a mostly causal/accumulative lens: her examination of the cracks leads to the spiral, the stone activates it, the bloom resolves the hum. Closure is decisive—the caves shift from cacophony to a “duet of hush and hum,” with the beings’ presence reconfigured rather than erased. The main weakness is that the ritual succeeds on the first try with no substantive setback or uncertainty, which softens the sense of earned resolution and price.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: collapse → failed prism → Elara’s methodical attempts → storm/moment of alignment → rekindling → communal aftermath. The closure beat is on-page and clear, with the pavilion’s reawakening and stars’ partial return functioning as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing of the beacon’s purpose. The storm’s moonbeam is a touch convenient, but it builds on her prior alignments and doesn’t feel like a pure deus ex machina. Structure (set-up of world, middle of repetitive attempts, climactic night, coda with survivors and years-later view) is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a descent from observatory to forecourt, a rising engagement with the crystal memory, and closure as the fog breaks and she redefines her role. Causality is accumulative/textural—each observation (solid fog, shadows, vibrations) deepens the central question rather than driving plot twists, and this lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes sole identification as “keeper” and accepts being part of the archive, with the cost of letting go of her fixation on preserving every moment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → mosaic note → following the knot’s pull → discovery of the chamber → ignition of the lilies → revaluation of “shadows.” Structure holds under a Causal lens with a clear before/after in Lira’s stance and an on-page closure beat. However, pressure is mostly assumed rather than dramatized; obstacles are minimal and each step works on the first try, which softens the sense of earned cost. Still, for this length, the single-scene arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by a paused argument, with the grotto interlude leading to a modest relational reconfiguration when she returns to Kael. Causality under an accumulative/situational lens is coherent—reflection and symbolic actions accrue toward her changed conversational approach. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise (they aren’t “fixed,” but the stance has shifted) with a clear before/after. The main limitation is the low intensity of consequence; nothing in the setup is meaningfully foreclosed or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: monthly inversion → ascent → trellis experience → loss of doll → bunker mourning → discovery of sprout and reframing. Causality is intact (gravity inversion and her clinging produce the doll’s loss; the sprout then reweights that loss). The closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which her relationship to both the bunker and the trellis shifts with clear cost. A slight tendency to explain concepts (“the gilded hush” definition) blunts some structural elegance but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored in time and place, with the storm glass’s unexpected stillness as the central turning point. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: long-term monitoring → anomalous stillness → conceptual reconfiguration of silence’s role. Closure is legible but low-cost: she decides to adjust her routes and pedagogy, yet nothing on the page resists or complicates that choice. The result is satisfying but not deeply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: shard pulses → hidden orchard → murals as map → keyhole → stairway → guardian → self-recognition, and the time-bound quest provides a coherent spine. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “unclaimed throne” is revealed as a metaphor for claiming one’s legacy, and the before/after is legible. The cost, however, is somewhat soft—she risks failure in principle, but we don’t feel a loss or near-loss at the climax; the guardian yields quickly once she asks the “right” question. Structurally publishable, but the trial could push her further to sharpen the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one scene framed by concise backstory, with a clear causal chain from loneliness → knocking → Kael’s arrival → decision to stand together. The dominant stake (fading thresholds and Elara’s inability to hold them alone) is stated early, but concrete consequences remain abstract, keeping the escalation modest. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara reopens a burned bridge to share the burden, with a legible before/after in her stance. The drive reads as mostly causal with accumulative texture, and it holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is cleanly causal: rising conceptual pressure → unstable diamonds → device message → turning the bolt → farm stabilizes and Mara’s perspective reconfigures. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: “Diamonds are a metaphor” reframes both the crisis and her personal history. However, the threat “we die” is resolved almost too neatly by a single action with no visible downside, which blunts the sense of cost at the end. Orientation and lens are clear throughout; the main shortfall is how low-friction the climax feels relative to the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: Lirael’s motivation → crank activation → standing waves/visions → discovery of the compartment → letters → reframed legacy and new decision. The story maintains a single-scene continuity with legible magical rules, and the closure (her conceptual and practical shift about the dynasty) is clearly earned by what she uncovers. Cost is present, if mostly emotional and conceptual—her grief and loss of an old narrative of her family. The structure is tight, though the middle visions could carry a bit more surprise or complication to fully maximize escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: program → line → unsnapping strings → greenhouse convulsion → staircase → orbs → shattering → reality shift and repricing. The structure fits a single drive lens without confusion, and the closure (conceptual repricing of “strings” and “possibility”) lands legibly. Cost is implied—loss of the greenhouse, dissolution of a prior self—but not deeply dramatized. A touch more friction or sacrifice at the descent/orb beats would strengthen the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: discovery of the button → investigation and inference → recontextualizing it with the engraved date → decision to create a new “Unknown Histories” file. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he shifts from passive archivist of erasure to active curator of the lost—without any causal breaks. That said, the stakes remain largely contemplative and the cost of his decision is only softly implied, so the final beat is more gently reweighted than sharply turning. Structure is elegant but not yet indispensable-level tight.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: key → tunnel → relay station → proof → alarms → escape with data as the station explodes. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the piece fits a tight single-mission structure with one meaningful turn when the alarms blare. Closure lands with a decisive change (truth secured, station lost) and a resonant reconfiguration of Mara’s role in her father’s legacy. The only limitation is that the escape and drones’ failure feel slightly easy, with little sense of options truly narrowing beyond the single sprint/dive.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: dream → return to grotto with goal → apparition appears and begins the coded prophecy → he counters via music and negative space → provisional success with uneasy afterimage. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when are quickly anchored), and the situational pressure of “don’t let them finish” is legible throughout. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—he has held the line for now, but at a cost and with the threat deferred, not erased. The only limitation is that the “code” and mechanics of the prophecy remain somewhat abstract, softening the sense of concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the dust → prodding it → following its trail → building monuments → leaves clarifying → messages decoded → new course of action. Structure is straightforward, single-scene, and the closure (she now knows what to do and commits to it) is legible and satisfying. The cost is light and the storm/Lirael threads feel like future hooks rather than pressures that truly constrict her options now. This reads as a strong, coherent vignette rather than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine: journal → map → cave → greenhouse → fall → retrieval → workshop reflection → return with seeds, and the closure (choosing to grow “clockwork flowers” and treat the compass as mirror) is a clean Conceptual Repricing. The subterranean fall supplies a physical climax that resolves the external quest for the compass. Costs remain largely conceptual/emotional; the story flirts with situational/accumulative texture but stays intelligible as causal. The only slight weakness is that the initial need for “truth” via the compass dissipates quickly once it’s found, softening the felt stakes of that quest at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael brings the coin to the foundry, uses it, summons Lira, and the conversation reconfigures his understanding, with the coin’s loss closing a path. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow; orientation (who/where/why now) is strong from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot retrieve her, but he gains a painful, partial answer and a new stance toward his guilt. The only limitation is that the world’s magic and consequences are sketched rather than rigorously developed, giving the climax a slightly staged feel.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a linear walk into the gorge, encounter with the harp-keeper, realization, and return, with clear causal linkage at each step. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lira reprices laughter and truth—and the crocodile’s tooth is tied into that. However, the pressure on her goal never seriously constricts options; nothing forces a difficult trade-off or threatens failure. The result is elegant but somewhat low-tension for a piece aiming at top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: one scene that accumulates pressure from sensory assault → spores/hum → encounter with the woman → reconfigured stance at the end. Causality is mostly internal-psychic rather than event-driven, but the beats track: forest triggers trauma, strap and memories sharpen his goal, the woman reframes his choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he shifts from searching for a formula to embodying a stance (“I’m bracing” and walking deeper). The woman’s sudden appearance and nature are under-motivated, feeling slightly like a convenient guide rather than an organic outcome of prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Lira seeks anchors of intuition → gets instructions and ink → follows painting clues → unfastens the fragment → returns to the weaver for conceptual closure. This is a Hybrid drive leaning causal with a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (“translation wasn’t just about words…”), and the before/after is legible. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal and success feels nearly guaranteed once she drinks the ink; the lens opens with little resistance. Still, the structure is coherent and the closure lands with a real, if quiet, shift in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: elevator issue → dust and vibration clues → ceiling cracks → hidden compartment → revelation that frees the ghosts. Structure is linear and contained to one scene, with a clear before/after reconfiguration once the family’s story is uncovered. Closure lands, but the cost is soft—nothing substantial is sacrificed or lost, and the elevator’s “repair” is more implied than dramatized. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative-textural with a mild causal spine, and it holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: anomaly in the frost → plate engraving → frantic printing aligned with dawn → bottled whisper shattering → library-wide rupture and transformation. Structure holds to a single escalating scene, with reflection interwoven but anchored in present action. Closure is solid: the library’s state and the patrons’ roles are decisively reconfigured, with a clear before/after and visible cost in the violent upheaval. The only limitation is that the “awakening” feels a bit preordained; there’s little sense that other substantial outcomes were genuinely in play.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is strong: scholarly dispute → mirror-covering scheme → temporal storm/vision → fungal reveal → public doubt in the Council, culminating in a quiet but clear reconfiguration of options. The piece uses a mostly linear single-POV structure with one summarizing time skip (“The dispute raged for weeks”) that fits the scope and doesn’t break momentum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the shard, fungus, and mirrors now signify buried crimes and nascent revolution, with the cost of heresy and ongoing struggle explicit. Some key confrontations (Council vs. Kael) are summarized rather than staged, slightly reducing the felt weight of turns.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—summons to the chamber → diagnosis of moral corruption → guided confession → realignment of the box—reads clean and legible under a Causal lens. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene structure suits the scope. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the box’s function changes once truth is spoken, visibly reweighting what “repair” means. The only limit is that the path from problem to solution feels relatively smooth, with few real obstacles once the premise is explained.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: the compass discovery causally leads to the delve, lagoon, revelation, and return, all in a single, coherent arc. Orientation is strong and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing—Lira reframes knowledge itself, accepting the lagoon as a threshold where explanation fails. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and atmospheric, which keeps escalation quieter than it could be, but nothing breaks causality. The return to the workshop and labeling of jars elegantly bookends and grounds the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clear: GPS failure and island confusion → discovery of the slide → portal → encounter with ancestor → return with new understanding, and the closure is a conceptual repricing of the island and her role. Structure holds as a single arc with one brief excursion, and the portal logic is legible within the piece’s rules. The main weakness is that the central drive—to “reimagine the island’s history”—never meets a concrete obstacle beyond initial mystery, so the climax feels more like a bestowed vision than a hard-won resolution. Cost at the end is implied responsibility rather than a dramatized trade-off, which keeps the closure from fully landing at a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: commission → fixation on window/postcards → Sister Agatha’s exposition → nocturnal investigation → inscription discovery → artistic shift → systematic cataloging. Structure is mostly linear with some efficient summary leaps that fit an accumulative/lyric design and keep orientation clear. Closure is a conceptual repricing: Mara’s understanding of nocturnal blooming and of the window’s “map to the hush” deepens, reweighting her grandmother’s note and her own work, though with soft on-page cost. The global drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diary → lagoon → parley → tunnels → codex → confrontation → deliberate collapse, with a clear Decisive Change at the trapdoor trigger. The “time’s up” constraint from Joran and the lagoon’s rule about staying past sunset give the structure a legible clock. The weakest link is the sudden appearance of the Historical Preservation head in the final chamber without prior on-page foreshadowing, which reads convenient rather than inevitable. Nonetheless, closure lands with a concrete cost and the story’s drive remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: discovery of the bottle → historical recall → extended labor → awakening/reimagining of the town, all under a single, coherent lens. Causality is soft but legible—the more he conceives and remembers, the more the town stirs—and there is a clear before/after in the cove’s state. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the bottle reframed as lens and the town partially revived, but the decisive turn is somewhat underplayed, happening almost passively as time passes. Stakes and cost are more implied than tested in a concrete, pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-time scene with an embedded, well-anchored memory, all causally oriented around the wax shaving and the foghorn’s silence. The accumulative/textural drive—sound patterns, emotional imprints, the shriek and hum—builds toward a conceptual reconfiguration of what the “prophecy” means. Closure lands as a quiet but clear Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when Voss reframes the event as awakening and commits to archiving and listening. Stakes are mostly conceptual and internal, which keeps the impact short of top-tier immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: egg hatches → ritual offering → vortex transit → altered atrium and sapling as proof of change. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the brief nonlinear “tunnel of swirling light” interlude is legible and resolves back into the same space with a decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—the path is reopened, the creature transformed/expended, the environment altered—with a conceptual cost in what she’s risked and given up. The main limitation is that the price and potential for failure are more told than felt, so structurally sound escalation doesn’t fully translate into on-page jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: repair → failed tone → switch to secondary mechanism → storms agitated → rhythmic ringing to restore balance. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the outset, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lira’s role in the sanctuary shifts from passive tester to active conductor, with the storms’ behavior visibly altered. The cost is relatively light (effort and new responsibility), so the arc feels graceful rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: station → star-event → trek to crater → return with reweighted lantern and softened director. Causality is simple but intact (seeing the fracturing star prompts the walk; missing the report creates the mild external cost), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Zara’s stance is quietly validated. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and is held consistently; the final image (stardust in the lantern, Veyra’s crack in demeanor) clearly marks a before/after. Stakes are modest and internal, but appropriate to the design.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: present-tense situation, established routine with the box, then a single escalation (the glow/visions) leading to the imperative “Speak” and the shattering box as closure. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: ghosts become visible → Elias studies box → box activates → message → he speaks → covenant releases. The closure is decisive and on-page, with a legible before/after, though the shift arrives somewhat quickly once the box glows, compressing the sense of struggle at the peak. No orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival at silo → discovery of hatch → interaction with damaged capsule → realization and exit, followed by a brief epilogue that reweights events. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each step meaningfully follows from the last (architect’s notes → hatch → coil/mercury → urn fragment trigger). Closure lands via conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration (his understanding of time and his letting-go of the talisman), with a legible before/after. Stakes and cost are more philosophical than sharply dramatized, but still clear enough for solid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: kite snap → decision to tend debris → weaving and song → acceptance of the tapestry’s impermanence. Causality is soft but legible, and there is a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end when she reframes beauty as process rather than permanence. The cost—accepting the tapestry will unravel—is conceptual and emotional but real within the story’s frame. The piece maintains a single scene and POV without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Lira’s remodel work → spiritual rumble → final copper-bridge attempt → spirit confrontation → transformed orchard and her death. The brief time-jump to “Days later” and then to “On her final morning” is legible and supports an Earned Stasis closure where her choice to remain pays off with cost. The drive reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyric texture), held consistently to the end. Stakes and turns are proportionate for the length, though the six‑month deadline could bear slightly more active on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: prior contact → gift of amber → tower and footprints → Kael’s challenge → use of amber → perceptual event and realization. The structure is a single continuous scene with a clear pivot at placing the amber in the sculpture and a quiet but legible closure beat at the aching “homecoming” and creaking door. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than situational, but Lirael’s unraveling skepticism and resurfacing longing provide enough weight for a Resonant Reconfiguration. Nothing crucial is left dangling, though the mystery of the Enclave’s larger stakes remains more gestured at than structurally active.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: arrival → planting/fertilizing guided by birds → charged departure under a gathering storm. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence; the reef’s death, the jetty, and twilight are all stable anchors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield is re-seen as nascent garden, framed by the phrase “The earth remembers,” with the cost of past war and ecological loss legible beneath the hope. The main limitation is that pressure never tightens into a hard test—events unfold smoothly without a truly narrowing decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: cylinders are found, riddles decoded, the community gathers, and the final answer (“love”) reconfigures the settlement’s sense of itself, satisfying a modest closure requirement. Causality is straightforward—each new cylinder leads to the next insight—but the lack of setback or complication makes the middle feel like a flat sequence of wins. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: layers of riddles and symbols build to an emotional reweighting rather than a hard turn. Closure is present but the cost of arriving there is barely felt, keeping this out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: anniversary ritual → glimpse → grandmother’s visitation → reinterpreted “true north” → corridor choice. Structure is straightforward with the glimpse functioning as a single major turn, and the closure beat (choosing a path and stepping through the door) is legible as a Decisive Change with a mild cost. However, the stakes of that choice remain abstract—we don’t feel what he’s concretely risking beyond comfort—so the ending lands more as a quiet pivot than a charged hinge. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational with thematic repricing), held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the sky is wrong → wards failing → Kael must swap the chess pieces → escalating tremors and magical backlash → successful rebalancing and restored sky. Structure is linear, focused, and appropriate to the length, and the closure (spire saved, identity reweighted) lands clearly on the page. The cost of success feels light—Kael never seems in serious danger of failure or sacrifice—which softens the impact of what are nominally city-scale stakes. Still, the story delivers a coherent, satisfying arc with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: ritual walking → intensifying gallery response → king topples → reversed pattern reconfigures the board → internal revaluation and exit. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; repetition of “unbind” builds toward the small but decisive physical turn (walking in reverse) that unlocks the change. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing: her understanding of history, agency, and her role is visibly reweighted with a new path implied. Stakes remain a bit abstract—there’s little sense of what she truly risks besides psychic strain—keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: pain of forgetting → retrieve feather → seed stone → vision of mother → cavern trial → shattering/return, with no major orientation issues. Closure is a clear decisive change plus conceptual repricing: Lirael internalizes the stone (shards in her skin) and reframes home as an act of remembering, with visible cost. The single transition (bookstore to cavern and back) is legible and motivated by the stone’s activation. The only limitation is that external obstacles are relatively light, so the escalation rests mainly on conceptual and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: examine labyrinth → decode tapestry threads → memory confrontation → follow revealed path → activate pedestal → unfreeze village, with his internal realization tied to the mechanism. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the backstory is cleanly anchored by the tactile act of plucking a thread. Closure is on-page and legible, with both an external reset (village reborn) and internal repricing (his failure re-understood). The main limitation is how frictionless the magical solution feels—no real setbacks or missteps temper the progression.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s decision to disrupt the ritual by painting “Forgive” triggers the canyon’s reaction, the elders’ faltering, and the spire’s refractive outburst. Structure is tight—a single continuous scene with a clear build to the visual and social transformation and a legible before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s echoes, the villagers’ attention, and the elder’s softened fury all signal a shifted order. The main weakness is the relatively low on-page cost: we’re told he’ll be called a heretic tomorrow, but we don’t feel any present sacrifice or irreversible loss in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—finding the charm in the statue, aligning it, narrating to activate it, escalating to respirator removal—is coherent and accumulative. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, with each beat intensifying pattern and meaning rather than introducing new plot branches. Closure is a clean conceptual repricing: meaning as survival and mending, with a physical cost (acid fumes, risk of dissolution) on the page. A slightly more concrete external consequence at the end (beyond stilled gears/sea) would deepen the sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: mirror crack → unease → decision to go to the caves → wrong turns → cavern → vision/drawing → return altered. The piece functions under a largely accumulative lens with causal underpinnings, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (he carries the cavern’s peace back). Stakes are modest, and the hinted physical danger of the cave network never truly materializes as pressure, which keeps the structural escalation gentle. Still, nothing important is dropped, and the arc feels complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: theft of the relic → dawn experiment with the vial → interruption by Thalos → expansion into the village’s response, with no orientation debt. The story follows a single, legible drive—testing whether whispered intent can travel—and lands in a quiet but definite reconfiguration where Elara’s belief is confirmed. Stakes remain small-scale and internal, and Thalos’s quick shift from potential obstacle to mentor slightly flattens dramatic tension. Nonetheless, the closure image of the village subtly but clearly pays off the setup under a primarily causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: hydraulics fail → beacons go dark → Mara turns to the censer foot and midnight calls → antenna construction → reverse migration begins. Structure is linear and legible, with the repeated midnight calls providing a clear rhythm and escalation. Closure lands solidly when the system activates and the grandmother’s voice commands “Now navigate,” marking a decisive before/after in her options. The cost and risk are more implied than dramatized, which holds the score just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: storm → need to reach oak/notes → encounter with Jorn → retreat to hut → ledger revelation → decision to “occlude.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: Mara redefines truth as something to be weaponized carefully in defense of psychological safety, with the ledger as new pressure. The cost (threat to the fragile peace she’s built, danger from “the ones who want the truth”) is present but could be made sharper on the page. Structure stays within one continuous window and holds together under a causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: boutonnière → meeting the woman → hatch/trunk/journal → vow to return memories. Structure is tight, one continuous scene with well-placed reveals and a legible closure beat (his commitment to act). The main weakness is how quickly he accesses the trunk and announces he can “return” memories; the mechanics and cost of that promise feel under-dramatized. Closure is present and coherent, but the path there is slightly too frictionless for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: map → journey → ants → cavern → chip → doorway-vision → changed return, with a legible before/after at the end (she comes back reoriented toward her own life). The structure fits a single-quest arc with one significant turn (chip touch/vision) and a quiet resolution, and there’s no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, which suits the scale. The only limitation is that external stakes never sharpen beyond “will she find something meaningful,” so the climax feels low-risk despite its emotional intention.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: warning → climb → grotto encounter → reframing → descent, with causality intact and no orientation issues. The drive lens reads as Situational with an Accumulative texture: the situation (grotto-as-wound) forces a stance crystallization rather than a big external event. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration; she leaves with a new understanding of herself and the dreams, and the before/after is legible. The main limitation is that the external consequences of this internal shift are only lightly implied, keeping the arc modest rather than fully urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: failing sun engines and a fading nexus → Jorin’s discovery of the ledger → revaluation of method → successful alignment of shell and engine. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure early, and the single-scene structure suits the length. Closure is a clear on-page Decisive Change: the nexus stabilizes and Elara adopts a new methodology/philosophy, with conceptual cost in surrendering control and fear. The only limitation is that the climactic success comes swiftly once the ledger appears, so the sense of tactical struggle in the final movement is a bit underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: grave → cabin/scroll → map → ledge/crevice → blank scroll/epiphany. The structure supports an accumulative, ritual-like progression and lands in a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure is present and coherent—the realization about “building” the past reframes the entire journey with some felt cost, though that cost remains mostly internal and understated. No major orientation or lens issues, but escalation is more contemplative than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear: object arrives with hinted emotional weight, Lira investigates, discovers the engraving, links it to the photo, and takes the action of writing and returning the note. Structure is linear and legible, with a small but real before/after shift in Lira’s stance and the charged act of sending the screw back. The main structural limitation is that the “complication” Mrs. Voss mentions never exerts much concrete pressure in the present, so the resolution feels more like interpretive completion than a hard-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: set-up of the ritual and risk, tension through the rune’s unstable formation, and closure with transformed scars and a newly opened path. Causality is coherent (rune → platform shudder → portal/path) and the drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a decisive internal change plus a reconfigured world option (portal and path), with cost in the relinquishing of fear and prior identity. Stakes remain appropriately scaled to this scene, though the danger of catastrophic failure is gestured at more than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp early: who, where, and the orchard deadline are all clear, and the causal chain (summons → ritual → voice → choice to finish) holds cleanly. The drive lens is primarily causal, with each beat logically emerging from the last. Closure lands on-page with cost: the bottle emptied, the sister’s resonance released/accepted, and the chainsaws starting mark a before/after in Elias’s guilt and the orchard’s fate. The only limit is that the ritual proceeds with relatively little resistance or complication once begun, which keeps the structural pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is clean: summons → exploration → mural encounter → inner journey → re-emergence with reconfigured understanding. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/lyric lens (actions with the dictionary trigger spatial and visionary shifts). Closure lands via conceptual repricing—the realization that spiral arbitration is internal and the dictionary going blank—but the turn is gentle, with minimal sense of risk or lost option. The “universe’s hiccup” remains backdrop rather than an active structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory that always ties back to the present ritual and the key. The accumulative drive (counting backward, deepening oddities, culminating in the fjord clock’s revelation) is coherent and satisfying, with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. The causal link between his counting and the world-shift remains a bit mystical, but the story teaches this pattern early enough that it feels intentional rather than arbitrary. The main limitation is that the cost of this new knowledge stays largely conceptual and could be rendered more sharply to elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: hired to test barriers → discovers their intent-sorting nature and fear → revealed dying core → re-tunes system via the laser → farm transforms. The structure holds as a tight single sequence with one clear turn in the inner chamber and a decisive change in the system at the climax. However, the stakes around “dying” and “afraid” remain under-specified, so the resolution doesn’t carry much felt risk or loss beyond a conceptual reconfiguration. Closure is present and legible, but the absence of a concrete consequence for failure softens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: subway scrawls → library clue → chalk outline → hidden staircase → subway car → fork → return. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the portal logic is consistent within the story’s terms. The closure—a return to the library with a reconfigured understanding and new intention—is legible and coherent, but the journey’s stakes never quite feel like they meaningfully threaten loss beyond mood. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a soft, reflective RR at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure of wrong-number vignettes through the night is clear and coherent, with each call building the pattern of Mara as a quiet broker of connection. Causality is soft but functional: callers arrive by chance, but her consistent response (“I can connect you”) shapes outcomes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the disc’s free spin and lullaby reprice the premise that “even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right,” with a gentle but definite before/after. Stakes and cost at the ending are modest, so the structural achievement doesn’t quite feel towering.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates significance around the covenant, the jetty, and the locket, leading to a conceptual reweighting at the end. Causality is modest but coherent—her observations and reflections drive her to reaffirm a method (small acts, proximate causes) rather than invent a new tactic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reframes the covenant’s weight as residing in the present act of preservation, then physically leaves the jetty carrying that decision. The main limitation is that cost and constraint are implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the closure strong but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: rumors → arrival → ritual setup with the moon rock → ghost encounter → reframing of loneliness → small internal reconfiguration. Orientation is excellent from the opening; the drive lens reads Causal with a conceptual-accumulative finish, and the ghost conversation functions as a clear closure beat (RR/CR). However, the stakes (“cure for loneliness”) never bite hard enough in scene, so the cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatically earned. The final shift feels satisfying but a bit low-pressure for elite-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: pause of constellations → dowsing → glade → thicket → river → digging → emotional map → stillpoint → mother. Orientation is excellent from the outset and the quest structure is easy to follow despite the lyricism. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he reaches “the place where feeling becomes seeing,” though the “hours, days” compression mutes the sense of ordeal and cost. Strong structure, but escalation and cost could be sharpened for elite-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: past meddling → blight and fever → journey to anomaly → encounter with Lira → reframed solution. Closure is solidly a Decisive Change as Elias abandons direct timeline “unbending” in favor of honest collaboration with the farmer, with a clear before/after. Some turns are a bit convenient—Lira’s appearance and the pen’s function arrive as ready-made explanations rather than emerging from Elias’s own attempts. Still, the structure is clean and the ending lands without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: Kael’s solitary “listening,” Lira’s arrival and collaboration, the crowd’s gathering, then the reflective dawn coda, all linked causally and temporally without confusion. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural drive, with pressure building through density of sound and witnesses rather than reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s relationship to silence shifts, and Kael’s success carries a visible emotional cost (“The joy of the night would fade... he felt a twinge of sadness”). The arc is modest but complete and fully legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clear causal arc: tapestry fragment → archive → Elara’s defaced image → Mara’s trail of interventions → healing portrait that reveals the grandmother → conceptual reframe of the archive and of Mara herself. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the archive shifts from static tomb to living garden, and vandalism is reweighted as necessary tending with emotional cost shown in Mara’s tears. Structure is clean (single throughline, no orientation confusion), but the near-miraculous healing of the portrait feels slightly convenient and un-resisted. A touch more friction or consequence around that transformation would deepen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: Eli arrives seeking understanding, immerses himself in the garden, encounters the woman, and the shared drumming reconfigures his relationship to the entangled memories. Causality under a mostly accumulative lens holds: each sensory and memory layer builds toward the choice to engage the lagoon rather than resist it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he reconceives the “curse” as a gift—with a plausible emotional cost anchored in his status as an experimental subject. The main structural weakness is relatively soft external pressure; refusing the call to remember never feels like a dangerous or genuinely viable alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: storm and challenge → Elias’s decision to test his whisper theory → discovery of the key and symbol → access to the map chamber → reconfigured understanding of the labyrinth. Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth is not just a shifting space but an observing intelligence that remembers “walks,” and Elias adapts his tactics accordingly. The brass key and hidden staircase feel mildly convenient, with little prior foreshadowing of such a mechanism, softening the sense of earned discovery. Cost at the ending is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the piece strong but not fully peak-level.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene where pattern-building with light gradually softens the canal’s “stillwater” tension. Causality is simple but intact: she arrives, performs the ritual, and the canal’s whispers grow gentler, giving a modest Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. There is no real structural surprise or strong turn; escalation is gentle rather than decisive, and cost remains low. Still, the closure is legible and clean for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: single evening, one core interaction, and a clear before/after centered on Lila’s stance toward her father and herself. Causality is coherent—grotto → revelation about the father → games → shared project—and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. The stakes remain modest and mostly emotional, with no beat where options truly narrow or a path is sharply foreclosed. Closure lands, but the sense of price paid is gentle and could be more sharply articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: violence and a vanishing island push Lira toward the sea, the whale’s call draws her deeper, and the act of letting go of the scrimshaw triggers the island’s final collapse and her release. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with one clear escalation point (following the call into the deep) and a legible Decisive Change at the climax. Closure lands: before/after is unmistakable in the disappearance of both island and old self, with a visible emotional cost. Some beats lean on convenient myth-fulfillment (the scrimshaw working exactly as legend suggests) without friction, which keeps this below elite-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one continuous scene of carving, braided with a single backstory thread, leading to a quiet but legible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Causality is coherent—her past loss under the mandate leads directly to this ritual practice and to the choice to continue it. Closure lands in the line about carving another spoon tomorrow and the day after, with the cost (ongoing risk and unhealed grief) embedded. The piece does lack a strong mid-scene turn; pressure deepens more through repetition and reflection than through a clear hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: present-tense ritual in a single location, steadily intensifying from humming quartz to cracking ice to walking on water. Causality is soft but coherent under a lyric/textural lens—her paraphrasing builds, the environment responds, and the final step onto “liquid glass” lands as a clear closure beat. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from early on, and the atrium-to-lake progression is spatially legible. The main limitation is the lightness of on-page cost, which keeps the closure more conceptual than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Marla’s trade → the plant arrangement and reed → the moth’s emergence → cobalt paint → mural-vision of Marla and the phoenix → Elias’s new way of seeing. Orientation is impeccable from the first line, and the single-scene structure with a brief flashback is well within scope. Closure lands via a decisive internal shift (Elias abandoning his gray-only practice) and conceptual repricing of “broken things” in light of Marla’s past. The main limitation is that the phoenix-fire revelation doesn’t significantly alter present stakes or tactics; it deepens context more than it changes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: lab setup → console activation with the lens → cave investigation → discovery → return to lab for conceptual reframe. The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Lira and Voss revalue the mountain’s ongoing song over engineered capture. However, the dominant stake remains largely conceptual, and the pilgrimage never meaningfully threatens failure or forces a hard choice; cost is implied effort and mild risk rather than dramatized loss. Structure (two main shards: lab and cave, then brief return) is coherent and scaled well to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: find stencil → claim observatory → devise/send origami → light lanterns → beacon/afterglow; closure is a clear conceptual reconfiguration of grief. Causality is soft but coherent, with each step following Elias’s project rather than arbitrary coincidence. Pressure and cost, however, remain mostly implicit; no beat forces a hard choice or visible sacrifice beyond physical effort. The rock-bottom backstory is told rather than staged, which slightly blunts the sense of before/after at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene from Mara’s arrival to the dawn closure, with clear causal flow (Mara’s fear → Elara’s demonstration → Mara’s decision to bring others). The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with the mapping ritual slowly reweighted from parlor trick to proto-cultural infrastructure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—rebuilding via pattern-mapping—though the conceptual cost is implied more than sharply dramatized. The piece is well-shaped but closer to an elegant vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with clear anchors (who/where/when) and a coherent causal chain: Lirael touches the forbidden pagoda, it activates, and her understanding of the archive reconfigures. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the archive shifts from “tomb” to “seed,” and Lirael moves forward with a new stance—which is legible and satisfying. However, the elders’ warnings and the notion of “corruption” never fully cash out into concrete risk or consequence on the page, making the climax feel more like a visionary experience than a pressure-tested turning point. Kael’s disappearance is abrupt and under-motivated as a beat, softening the sense of cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: dream → altered stone → archival footage → Thalos’s revelation → comparison of timelines → key word → transformation, with no major logic gaps. The structure is linear and well-contained in one primary scene plus brief contextual backstory that clearly feeds the present action. Closure is solid—a decisive change in the shadow and the library with a clear before/after—but the solution leans heavily on Thalos already knowing crucial information (future stone, nature of the network), which softens the sense of earned discovery. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: misty workshop → tools and tail focus → reflection on the con and shedding → dawn completion and reframed conviction, with no orientation issues. Causality is simple but coherent—her crisis after the con leads to retreat, then to reconstructing the tail as a vehicle to reconstruct her sense of purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn; the before/after in her stance is legible and carries emotional cost, though the path is thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: touch hourglass → tunnel opens → coffee rings trigger shard-like memories → altar/hourglass vision → return and reconfiguration. This yields a coherent before/after: from seeking closure and amnesia around the accident to possessing a new interpretive frame for her scars, with the cost of reliving trauma on the page. The structure reads as a controlled single descent with shard-visions rather than scattered flashback, and closure (a conceptual repricing of scars and “miracle”) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Mara arrives with a goal, uses psychometry, receives one vision, then a deepened second vision with names and history, and exits with a reconfigured mission. Backstory is anchored to immediate sensory triggers (film strip, booth) and doesn’t fracture orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—the idea of “unused love” is literalized and she chooses an ongoing role as its steward—but the price of that choice is only lightly implied, not sharply dramatized. The drive lens (primarily causal with a lyric overlay) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear and causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: longing → activation of the sextant → portal/chamber → stardust ingestion → visionary experience → dawn aftermath. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (who/where/what he wants), and the magical logic (sextant triggers hologram triggers opening) is coherent enough for this mode. Closure lands as a resonant internal shift rather than a decisive plot turn, with the “before/after” legible in Kael’s renewed drive and changed relationship to his creativity. The main limitation is that the story never truly threatens failure or reversal; events unfold in a mostly smooth ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is strong: Kael finds an anomalous clock → mysterious guide explains its stakes → he undergoes a quantum-like shift → he repairs the clock and reboots the archive’s dreaming function. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who, where, situation) and the archive’s rules are sketched efficiently enough to support the climax. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: Kael begins to dream and the dune’s sparks start to grow. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk of failure, identity shift) rather than dramatized, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: wandering → discovery of the clearing → insertion of the gear → revelation of the forest-brain → threshold crossing → realization that the gear is a seed and must be surrendered. Closure is solidly on the page: she ends with an empty pocket and altered understanding, in a new stasis where the forest’s secrets endure but her relationship to them has changed. The cost is conceptual and emotional more than practical, but it’s legible. The structure is linear and tight, though the climax resolves very quickly once her father appears, with minimal friction around her ultimate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clear accumulative journey: dock → entry to ridgeway → encounters with travelers → clearing → symbolic relinquishing of the punch → return to dock. Causality is coherent, and the closure (conceptual repricing of “finding courage” into helping others remember it, then returning to vigil) is legible with a quiet but real cost of ongoing duty. The main limitation is that the central quest (“find where unused courage waits”) is resolved largely by explanation rather than a dramatized turn, so the decisive change remains conceptual rather than narratively sharp. Still, for this length the before/after in Jorin’s understanding is solid and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—neglected bolt → scream/void → internal crisis → staircase epiphany → return and speech → reconfigured role—is clear and cohesive. Closure lands cleanly: Elric decisively breaks his contract of silence, altering the fortress’s social rules and his identity. The staircase stain as the mechanism of insight is the weakest link structurally, feeling like a symbolic shortcut rather than a dramatized chain of thought, slightly softening the rigor of causality. Still, for this length the single scene progression and reweighted ending image function well.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: deciphered messages → timing with the Convergence → pellet opens the way → pellet sunders the pretender. Orientation is excellent and the story delivers a decisive change with clear before/after stakes (false ruler → exposed construct, throne empty). However, the structure feels like an efficient outline of success: each step works on first attempt, the guards never actually intervene, and cost is implied at scale but not deeply dramatized. Closure is solid but the path there feels low-friction for such high declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine—odd atlas page → accumulating anomalies → bioluminescent coordinates → choice to follow—is clean and legible, with one coherent closure beat when they leave the station. The hybrid lens (causal plus conceptual repricing) holds, and the final choice marks a clear before/after. The big reveal—that the ban awakened a reality-rewriting force and the islands are gateways—is delivered in a summary lump rather than dramatized, softening impact. Still, closure lands on the page with a felt shift in options and direction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: a lull in the rebellion → Lira investigates the humming stones → she predicts an alignment → stages a ritual that audibly reignites rebel morale. The single-scene structure is coherent and well oriented, and the closure unit (the rebellion shifting from embers to “a storm, gathering”) is legible. The main weakness is the low sense of risk or potential failure—the stones work on first try, with no serious opposition or cost, so the decisive change lands more as a graceful inevitability than a hard-won turn. That softens the felt stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: kite → script → digging → vault → embryo → choice to plant, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “implanted destiny,” with her decision to plant in the springs reconfiguring what the embryo means. However, the path is almost too smooth: the drones and regime pressure are mostly atmospheric and never materially complicate the unsealing or planting. The ending feels complete but lightly priced, limiting structural impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Lila comes to the arboretum seeking stillness; a sensory trigger (wind on the gate) provokes a flashback; she uses the somatic tools Mrs. Voss taught her; this enables her reconfiguration at the end. Structure is straightforward single-scene with interleaved backstory that remains anchored and legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but the before/after in her relationship to Elias’s photo and to her grief is clear and costs something. The only limitation is that escalation is modest and somewhat predictable, without a surprising structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: walls closing in → discovery of threads → redesigning his art → ritual arrangement in the lighthouse → conceptual reweaving. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: reality and his art shift from fragmentation to potential wholeness, with the final “rewoven” line clearly marking a before/after. Causality is soft but traceable through internal logic rather than plot mechanics, fitting the mode. The cost of this shift (what he gives up or risks) is more implied than sharply dramatized, which blunts the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: tracking the drone → decoding via ink ritual → revelation of the Tower → corroboration by the child → journey to door and entry. The piece lands clear closure with a decisive change (stepping into the Tower) that reconfigures her options and commits her to danger. However, most obstacles are informational rather than oppositional, and each step yields fairly easily once attempted, which softens the sense of cost. Still, for this length, the structure is coherent and satisfying under a causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: contraband letter → decision to violate duty → activation of chamber → Kael’s awakening → commitment to revolution, giving the piece a legible before/after. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Lirael has crossed a line and cannot return, with conceptual cost framed by the certainty that “the Council would come for them.” However, most consequences and larger-world stakes are gestured toward in future-tense summary rather than tested on the page, which softens impact. Structurally it’s solid but not yet gripping enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-time tending of the farm interwoven with backstory about the tower and the father’s transformation, all converging on Lira’s redefinition of “quiet.” Causality is soft but coherent—each reflection is clearly cued by objects in the scene, so the temporal layering doesn’t blur orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the farm becomes a “revolution,” and her whisper of “Quiet” recasts prior images with conceptual cost. What keeps this just below elite level is the low degree of situational pressure; no choice at the end truly alters practical options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: disrupted patterns → need to summon/trace the goddess → use of spike/emitter → apparition → her dissolution stabilizing the sky. Orientation is solid and quick; single scene, single POV, and the global drive (fixing the garden/constellations by contacting the goddess) is stable throughout. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost: the goddess is absorbed into the garden and the constellations re-order, leaving Kael in a new stasis. The only limitation is that the link between understanding the “sleepwalking constellations” and what, concretely, changes for Kael remains conceptually a bit abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: the midnight call prompts investigation, which yields damning evidence, which leads to collaboration with the journalist and then public exposure with fallout. The structure—archive night → noon handoff → brief aftermath montage—reads coherent and purposeful for ~800 words. Closure lands with a clear before/after: she moves from protected heir to active whistleblower, with social and familial cost legible on the page. The investigation is slightly montage-like rather than dramatized in discrete obstacles, but it still supports the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: restless firmware → amber key → decision to tether via letters → entry into firmware → nursery confrontation → rewritten code/silence. The transition into the digital corridor is legible and the closure beat (cry turning to hum, lab quieting) delivers a clear before/after with cost implied. Some steps (e.g., the ease and speed of rewriting the firmware) feel lightly summarized rather than fully pressured, which softens the climax. Still, the drive lens stays coherent and closure is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: find tile → attune via mandala → decipher directive → choose to interject → grotto transforms → realization of language and purpose. Causality holds under a largely Causal-with-Accumulative lens, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s role shifts from observer to decoder. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she risks destabilizing her sanctuary, but the grotto responds benevolently, softening any sense of loss. Still, for this length, the arc is legible and complete, with no orientation or lens failures.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single-scene, accumulative/textural structure: find tessera → recall past → integrate it into stepping stone → reframe the plaza and depart. Causality is simple but intact, and the closure beat (the act of renaming and final walk away under a softening sky) clearly reconfigures meaning. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than situational; no option truly narrows on the page, which keeps the structure from feeling fully decisive at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Elias uses the coin to produce echoes, arrivals increase, the maze and garden respond, and all culminate in a convergence where timelines knit and the coin is erased. Causal links are soft but present under the lyric frame (because he hums → echoes appear → maze shifts → spirits gather → dance mends fracture). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the coin’s blankness and the garden’s restored promise reweight what “encore” and “possibility” mean. Cost is somewhat underplayed—Elias fading feels routine for a ghost, not a newly paid price—which keeps this from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal spine is clean: static shock → new perceptions → decision to reject recall/pills → devised system using somatic markers → breakthrough → commitment to share. The brief time-jump (“Over the next week…”) is handled smoothly and feeds directly into the climactic alignment moment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward enhancement tech and self-awareness crystallizes with a forward-driving decision. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and personal rather than sharply tested on-page, which keeps the structure from feeling fully high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: tool use → emotional hologram → algae touch → portal experience → spores → new mission, with no orientation issues. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing of “the unknown” and a decisive redefinition of Lira’s role as translator rather than mere map maker. The cost at the end is mostly conceptual and anticipatory rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps the structure solid but short of truly gripping. Still, for this length, the single-scene progression and final stance shift are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: she’s summoned, searches, finds the jar, discovers a method (buttons), gains access to the echo, and exits with a reframed understanding. Causality is steady under an accumulative/textural lens—her sorting work coincides with and helps justify the echo’s clarification. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of prophecy and future, though the cost is largely intellectual rather than dramatized. The scene holds as a single coherent unit with no orientation issues, but a sharper felt price at the end would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a single anchored scene at Zephyr Bluff, interleaved with tightly linked backstory and a clear causal chain from dream → journey → decoding → renewed resolve. The global drive is largely causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara commits to continue to the weather station with a reweighted understanding of courage. Stakes and cost are modest but legible (choosing to engage again with a dangerous world despite fear), and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The piece could feel more structurally powerful if the act of vouchsafing were tested or opposed on the page rather than remaining wholly preparatory.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece functions as a single, coherent scene with clean orientation (where, who, ritual of crossing) and an accumulative/textural drive. The closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Thaddeus steps off the ferry with a reaffirmed understanding of the “palimpsest promise” and his role as one more layer. However, causality is extremely gentle—waiting, crossing, leaving—with little sense of options narrowing or knowledge decisively changing. The ritual frame holds, but the before/after divide feels conceptually interesting rather than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: arrive → investigate via sun patterns and lantern → induce vision → reinterpret oasis → depart to apply lesson elsewhere. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main escalation (the thrumming/vision sequence) leading to a conceptual closure. Cost and risk remain low—nothing seriously threatens Mara or the oasis on the page—so the arc feels more like a well-executed vignette than a fully pressurized story. Still, the closure (oasis “choosing” a timeline; Mara carrying the lesson forward) lands clearly under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear and linear: fire escape reverie → dock beat with the gauge → approach to Mara → opening the shop to light, with clean causal links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she lets him and the light in), giving a before/after for both characters and the harbor’s emotional landscape. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, and the ending honors that, but the cost and stakes at the climax remain muted. There are no serious orientation or causality slips, but the pattern of pressure could tighten further to hit top-tier competition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: hum intensifies → sundial activates → realization of the key → decision to document her own story, yielding a clear before/after. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each fantastical beat grows logically from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from being a “contemporary of extinct species” to a self-declared “pioneer of the living,” with the library’s transformation echoing that shift. The main limitation is that the turn feels emotionally inevitable rather than hard-won—structurally sound but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: arrival at temple → encounter with spiral → meeting Elara → art installation → secret written → orbs sink and realization lands. Causality holds under a mostly causal, lightly accumulative lens, and the closure qualifies as a modest conceptual repricing (connection reframed as courage to share). The stakes are narrow and internal, and there’s little sense that alternatives might seriously derail her, but within the chosen scale the arc is coherent. No orientation or lens-clarity problems.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: anomalies → institutional and social pressure → Lila’s technical gambit → partial success → renewed but reconfigured threat. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with a legible closure in the charged poise of an ongoing “game” rather than a full victory. The cost remains conceptual and lightly sketched—there’s little sense of what she’s truly risking beyond generic danger, which slightly blunts the ending’s impact. Still, the before/after (discord to truce, community softening) reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → organ awakens → vision of key → spatial corridor → resistance → compass in wall → key and gateway. Closure is on-page (he acquires the key and steps through, accepting the unknown), but the cost of doing so is only lightly touched (resurgent claustrophobia, vague threat of “something worse”). The drive lens reads primarily causal with a situational overlay, and it holds consistently. Some set-ups (his preparation for traps/ghosts, the “fallow period”) don’t fully pay off in concrete conflicts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: quarry → ribbon → drawing and tracing → handprint → locket → decision to reopen the case, with a brief studio coda. Structure fits a single-scene investigative vignette with a small epilogue, and closure is clear (the case reopens; Clara’s perspective shifts). The main flaw is the abrupt leap where Clara confidently names the girl Lila and knows her tastes without any groundwork, which strains plausibility at the decisive moment. Aside from that, orientation and temporal flow are stable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: parcel → research → coded stanzas → digging up the codex → revelation → rooftop incantation under a fast-escalating storm. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence, and the single-POV, single-arc structure remains coherent throughout. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment: Clara crystallizes her stance by invoking the stanza despite real danger, with the nail heating and station shaking as on-page cost. The ending is intentionally open, but a slightly clearer articulation of what might be reversed (personal reputation vs metaphysical exile) could sharpen the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: hitchhiker → discovery of flake → decoding its nature through music → transition to a new realm → encounter with Marisol and the articulated choice. Structure holds as a single scene with one temporal/locational shift and a clear closure beat (Charged Poise around the second playing). The main weakness is that the stakes of the “pixelated amnesty” remain conceptual rather than concretely priced, so the final turn feels more like setup for a larger story than a fully paid-off change. Orientation is strong throughout; no confusion about who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: past with his father → fixation on cycles of greed → plan using bills as territorial markers → observed effect → internal re-evaluation on the train. The structure (train frame + summarized campaign at the startup) is simple but coherent, with a clean before/after conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: he decides he can break the cycle by how he uses what he inherited. The main limitation is low on-page resistance; nothing meaningfully threatens his plan, so the turn feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: telegram → star work → Veyra’s arrival with new information → prism demonstration → Lirael’s choice to witness → empathetic immersion → reinterpreted inscriptions. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional shift: the temple is re-understood as a map of empathy, with a concrete token (glyphs on her skin in her brother’s hand). The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal arc delivering a conceptual repricing at the end) and holds consistently. Cost is present but muted; the ongoing danger or price of carrying all those burdens is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failed ritual → return to the lake → entry into the vortex → use of the seed → vision and reinterpretation of the past. The story maintains a single scene with coherent spatial logic and a clear global drive (causal with an internal-arc focus), and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of Mira’s past act. The seed’s eruption and truth-spores are somewhat convenient as a mechanism but they don’t break the logic the story has set up. The structure is tight for this length, though the external lake-conflict softens rather quickly once the vision begins.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: clipping → vision → reappeared Labyrinth → confrontation with the double → choice to heed the scars → covenant restored / world altered. Structure is straightforward single-POV, one through-line, with no orientation debt and a clear before/after at the ending. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus a conceptual repricing (intersection of dreams as choice), though the cost of that change is somewhat abstract. All major set-ups (clipping, scars, covenant, future arriving early) receive at least a minimal pay-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: she enters to barter, offers the Fool, is given a ritual task (sewing), completes it, and pays the final price by eating the fruit, leading to an on-page reconfiguration of self. Closure is strong: the before/after of her stance toward her past and her recklessness is unmistakable and carries emotional cost. The structure is a single through-line scene with no orientation issues and one clear tightening when sewing becomes the vehicle for transforming regret. The one limitation is that external obstacles are minimal, so pressure comes almost entirely from her interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: TV failure → retreat to quarry job → discovery of cloth → research → phone call → new purpose. Structure is straightforward but effective, with one main tightening at the reveal of the phoenix logo and Echo Valley’s history that reweights the object. The phone call resolution is slightly convenient—locating and reaching the bassist feels easy and low-friction—but it doesn’t break plausibility at this scale. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing when Lenny reframes his work from valuation to resurrection with on-page emotional cost (abandoning pure fact-insulation).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the seed → study and analogy → ritual activation → arbor’s reanimation and conceptual reframing. The single-scene structure is coherent and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of what “transition” means. However, the drive lens is mostly accumulative/textural with light causal pressure, and stakes remain conceptual rather than concretely tested. There is a clear before/after, but with limited on-page cost or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → explanation/offer → transformation → coda with the child, all under a single, coherent frame. Causality is straightforward (visitors seek change; the librarian guides them; the creel transforms), and the closure beat (fish becoming bird / wonder preserved) lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and that pattern holds: each transformation thickens the core idea without breaking logic. The main limitation is that the emotional/causal stakes of the transformations feel relatively low-risk despite the elegant patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear and coherent: disturbance in the caves → investigation → discovery of shell → choice to place the pearl → activation → reconfigured mission. Causality holds and the closure is solidly on the page, with a conceptual before/after in how bunkers and Elias’s role are understood. The cost is somewhat diffuse and largely conceptual—Elias absorbs resonance and changes vocation, but we don’t feel a sharp loss or foreclosed path. For a top-tier venue, the arc could use one more concrete complication or consequence before the pearl is placed.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: station → bathroom graffiti → drainpipe arrows → river → interior re-mapping → charged departure. Causality is clear at every step (each bit of graffiti prompts the next physical and conceptual move), and the orientation is excellent from the first sentence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes forgiveness from static destination to river-like process and acts on that by creating a new kind of map. The emotional cost is present but understated; her prior cartographic certainty and self-punishing stasis feel loosened, though the narrative doesn’t press hard on what risks that entails.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain (enter library → observe delays → document → decode → find book) is coherent and easy to follow. Structure is essentially one straight progression with a modest tightening around the humming shelf and the symbol match. Closure exists—she finds the library of unspoken words—but the lack of a felt price or significant reversal limits the impact of that ending.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure: observatory → divination → dilemma → renunciation, with clear causal links. Closure is solid Earned Stasis: she deliberately forecloses the imperial path, with the violin’s shattering and the lingering ache marking the cost. The accumulative pattern of “propagate,” stains, and plants builds toward that choice without detours. The only structural constraint is that the external consequences of her choice remain offstage, keeping the change mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The scene is cleanly structured: set-up of goal and stakes, immersion into the pool, discovery that the threshold is a lens, then the crisis of the cracking pool and improvised solution. Causality is solid—each turn (“infuse,” threshold-as-lens insight, pool cracking) follows from the last, and the resolution stems from Lirael’s established skills and tools, not a late rule change. Closure lands as a successful capture with cost (her exhaustion, risk to all prior echoes) and a conceptual reweighting of “stillness.” There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Lirael’s quest for understanding → recollection of the betrayal → Elara’s return with the hairpin → Lirael’s reframed understanding of rebirth and contentment. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the backstory is anchored and relevant. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lirael consciously choosing a stance of practiced contentment and renewed sisterhood. The cost—risking trust again—stays mostly conceptual and gentle, which keeps the structure solid but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: he’s hired, tests the cloak, then deciphers the chimes, leading to Mira’s choice and his departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira actively selects which “chimes” (truths/doubts) to keep, and Elias walks away slightly altered. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (situational pressure with thematic/accumulative texture), and it holds consistently. Stakes and cost, however, stay relatively low-key; nothing on the page narrows options to a truly fraught decision, which keeps this from the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: an initial experiment, the intrusion of the apprentice, then a time-compressed series of nights culminating in Lira’s decisive act. Causality is coherent—Elara’s withholding leads to Lira’s growing pressure and, finally, her own attempt. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Lira reframes vanishing as “becoming,” reweighting the lesson. Stakes remain mostly conceptual, but the arc is tidy and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: a preparatory wait, the birds’ appearance, meditative engagement with the pulse, and a quiet next-day resolution. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds—bird pattern → insight → altered stance and descent from the tower. Closure is present but low-cost: Kael “understands” and begins a journey, yet no concrete alternative path is visibly foreclosed beyond a general change in outlook. The reflective backstory is integrated, but it slightly dilutes present-tense pressure rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mist walking grants entry, the keystone plus starlight opens the deeper chamber, the garden and fountain trigger a reframing, and the mist walking reversal ejects him once he’s changed. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative texture and a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (where sacredness is redefined). Closure lands, but the cost is mild and the obstacles are soft—almost everything works on the first attempt. Structurally it’s one coherent arc with a neat descent and ascent, but it never tightens into a truly pressured decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s structure is clean: harbor → approach to wreck → door 13 → inner library → revelation → return, with each step causally motivated. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration—he reinterprets sound, vows, and his own grief—and there is a legible before/after state marked by leaving the key and walking home unafraid of the dark. The coincidence of the “13” door and the key fitting is heavy-handed but thematically coherent rather than a true causality break, and the pressure is accumulative rather than turn-driven but holds under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: orienting setup, investigation via sensors/coins, then the distillation protocol culminating in a conceptual realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing—the prophecy reinterpreted as mirror/alignment rather than doom, with Kael choosing to embody it. Causality is generally coherent (coins → vision → insight → protocol), though turns are more declared than dramatized. The cost at closure is more implied than felt, so the ending lands intellectually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: observatory → atlas discovery → recordings/echo rule-set → prism experiment → monsters manifest → naming/dissolution → reconfigured purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a heavier atlas and a clarified stance toward fear and his role. Stakes and tools are all set up before use, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than physical but is legible on the page in his “ache of knowing.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: broken ecosystem → broken bell → Elias’s plan → scaffold + tuning the drip → partial restoration and fragile new equilibrium. The single-scene structure is clear, with no orientation issues, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration: the rift is “balanced” rather than solved, with ongoing cost implied. Escalation is somewhat linear—there’s not a sharp structural turn, more a steady working-through—so the climax feels quiet. Still, closure under a causal lens is solid and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story tracks cleanly: omen (wind chime) → clue (label) → descent to the drowned town → encounter with Elias’s daughter → reframing of Mara’s role → new commitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the added photo and shared walk clearly marking a before/after. The causal spine is intact, though the dam’s impending failure feels more like atmospheric backdrop than a pressure that must be tactically addressed. Some backstory (Elias’s final act) is compressed into exposition, but it still supports the core arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal flow from discovering the crystal to decoding it via the starlings’ patterns to writing the bridging formula is clean and legible. The piece operates on a largely causal-but-lyric lens, and the closure (her new understanding embodied in the formula and her stance toward the coming transformation) lands clearly on the page. Cost is present in the deliberate self-injury and in choosing a path that will commit her to the “final transformation” tomorrow. Stakes are more hinted than actively pressured in this scene, so the structural arc feels slightly low-temperature for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: radio static eases, the forest’s urgency spikes, Kael diagnoses a disrupted node, uses the buckle via muscle memory to repair it, then repeats until dawn, ending in a reconfigured stance toward his role. The global drive is Causal with some accumulative texture, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (burden → covenant) with the external confirmation of the arbor stabilized. Time passing to dawn is handled smoothly via montage-like compression without breaking orientation. The main limitation is that the “if he fails the world unravels” stake never comes close to actually tipping on the page, so the structural arc feels somewhat low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → confrontation → duel escalating into psychic/energetic struggle → decision to merge via the brain-in-jar → clone’s erasure and Kael’s reconfigured self. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong internal component, and the closure (Kael emerging whole, the sky stabilizing) lands clearly with a before/after contrast. Cost is present conceptually (risk of mutual destruction, sacrifice of the separate clone self) but not deeply dwelt on emotionally. Structure is tight and well-contained in one scene, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious envelope → investigation → planting → anomalous growth → disappearance/trail → key at the brook → conceptual realization. The piece holds a Causal lens with a modest but legible closure: a conceptual repricing of what a “puzzle” and “answer” are for Elias. However, the stakes remain largely abstract and cerebral; there’s no serious consequence if he fails, so the decisive change feels low-cost. Structure is otherwise coherent and well-scoped for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation, activation of the machine, tentative response from the tunnel, intensification, then a clear, on-page burst of resolution. Causality is intuitive—his sustained, exhausting effort with the leaf blower and singing brings the echoes to life—and the who/where/when are anchored early. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the laughter is restored and his physical collapse shows cost. The arc is somewhat straightforward, with no real complication once the tunnel begins to respond, which keeps it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: waiting → cultist’s arrival → confrontation over the pendant → decision to discard it → threshold crossing to the library. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual repricing (boundaries as doors), and the scene break to the atrium reads as the direct consequence of her choice. The cost to the garden/cultist is gestured at rather than fully felt, so the aftermath lands more as elegant pivot than wrenching sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: crozier broken → Kael decides to repair it → successive failures → realization that his own essence must bridge the crack → sacrifice and transformation. Orientation is excellent from the start (who/where/when are quickly clear), and the closure—both in the repaired crozier and Kael’s internal shift—is legible with cost. The one-scene structure fits the length and holds the drive lens consistently, but the external stakes of success or failure (for the nexus/world) stay a bit abstract, so the climax lands more as an interior rite than a fully pressured plot turn. Still, in terms of structure and closure this is publication-ready with only modest deepening needed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: arrive to tune in during lunar perigee → use fragment to reveal possibility → fight tower’s resistance by stripping components → trigger the city’s rebirth. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure fits the length, with a legible before/after at the end. Closure is present as a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, but the difficulty curve is shallow—the tower’s “resistance” never threatens real failure or reversal. As a result, the resolution feels somewhat easy for the level of metaphysical stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: the emptied hourglass signals the bridge event, which pushes Kael to use the radio, which in turn activates the grotto and forces the decision to merge timelines, culminating in the ferry’s dissolution. Structure is clean and linear with a clear before/after: Kael as deckhand vs. Kael alone after the Starward’s sacrifice. The closure unit is solid, with the Decisive Change (merger and ferry’s end) and Resonant Reconfiguration (new constellation, new role) evident and paid off. The main weakness is that the high-risk choice to merge, though foreshadowed, feels a touch too swift and uncontested given its world-scale implications.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: entry into gallery → experimental weaving → eruption into liminal space → learning to use the web → return and reframed understanding. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the single POV, single throughline design fits the length. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Clara’s view of reality and connection is explicitly altered with a before/after legible on the page. The main limitation is that the transition to success in the void (weaving a door) is very smooth, with little resistance or complication once the premise flips.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: classroom → solitary reflection with the chain → field lesson at the city’s edge → quiet reorientation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the move outward to the edge and the student’s question deepen the initial concern about shifting maps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lirael reframes her role and desire—but the cost of this shift is only lightly implied. Stakes and turns remain modest, so the arc feels more contemplative than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: photo → vibration via old hearing aid → deeper into atrium → second hearing aid → message → delivery to widow, with no orientation issues. The story satisfies closure through a decisive change in knowledge and relief for both widow and ghost, plus a modest reconfiguration in Lila’s sense of her work. That said, the path feels relatively frictionless—there is never a moment where failure seems genuinely possible—so the structure reads polished but low-pressure. Still, for this length, the single continuous scene with a clear arc is strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: codex → descent → discovery of fleck → rising tide → activation → revelation → escape, all in one continuous scene. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration when she reads the cables as memorials and accepts a partial, costly form of finding her brother. The lurch of the facility and incoming tide provide a concrete ticking clock. The only softness is how effortlessly the gold’s function pays off once attached to the terminal, which edges toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as a single continuous scene under an accumulative/textural lens, with the error and observatory systems as ongoing pressure and the “choose” challenge sharpening the central dilemma. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: he decides not to resolve the contradiction but to live inside it, which creates a clear before/after in meaning. Causality is soft but coherent—beats follow from his project with the system and the ink. The cost of his choice (ongoing haunting rather than clean resolution) is present but somewhat underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: set-up of her long project, the specific experiment at dusk, the activation of the diamond, and the canyon’s counterstroke leading to her decisive rejection. Causality is strong—her attempt to harness the diamond directly triggers the bone towers’ awakening and the canyon’s demand for “payment,” and throwing the diamond into the abyss is a clear Decisive Change with cost. The revelation that the curse is a mirror arrives at peak pressure and is conceptually apt, though it feels slightly explained rather than fully dramatized through prior smaller misfires or hints. Overall, the arc is coherent and complete, with one meaningful tightening and a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: infiltration → encounter with herbalist → phone/confessions → metamorphosis → decision to return human with a new stance. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with one clear internal turn (giving in to the static) and a closure beat where the arrowhead’s new symbol reconfigures Elara’s options. Closure reads as a Decisive Change with cost: she forecloses staying in the garden’s “lightness” to re-engage the surface in a different role. Some world-mechanics (how exactly the cryptid/static system functions) stay hazy, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: Lira’s deliberate playing → vibration into the crack → reach into the cores → orchard’s magical eruption → statues’ collapse, culminating in her conceptual shift about control. The piece holds a coherent throughline from rigid order to reawakened wild magic with a clean before/after. Cost is legible (physical strain, loss of the statues’ imposed order, destabilization of the orchard into something riskier). The only slight weakness is that the geyser of light feels somewhat convenient in timing, even if thematically seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: he finds the bottle, chooses to send it via drone, and the resulting storm reconfigures the border’s mood and his understanding. Structure is straightforward and legible, with a single clean transition from border to arcade and back to the shack/arcade for the payoff. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration and mild conceptual repricing—the world is still disputed, but the atmosphere and his sense of what’s possible have changed. The main limitation is that the storm’s mechanism and consequences feel a bit convenient and low-friction, with no serious obstacle or complication before success.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive → quest for fragment → wind-bell guidance → courtyard → singing-induced transformation → reframed understanding of silence. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure is present as a conceptual repricing (silence as beginning). However, the “halo fragment as key” setup never truly tests or complicates anything; the path is linear, and cost is minimal. The added courtyard shard is integrated but feels more like a discovery vignette than a tightened final trial.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: late shift → articulated restlessness → deliberate experiment → other-dimensional room → quiet return with new stance. Causality is legible and the hyperbolic geometry/scarf combo leads to the portal moment without feeling random. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Eleanor finds the “place where stories lived” and returns changed—but the cost of that discovery is minimal and largely conceptual. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with light causal scaffolding, and it holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: daily ritual → anomalous sunrise → failed blending of colors → vitalization surge → dream manifestation → repricing of her quest. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens, with the magic grounded in her established method rather than a late rule change. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses the path of endless pursuit and accepts an internalized version of the dream, with an articulated before/after. Stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, but they are coherent and carry a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: he comes to the nexus with a goal, uses the locket, triggers the unlocking, causes disorientation, and ends in a transformed space with a new understanding. The single-scene-plus-transition structure is clear and the closure (his conceptual and situational shift) lands on the page with a discernible cost. The stakes remain largely internal and metaphysical, but they are coherent under that lens. A more concrete external complication or choice at the climax could have tightened the structural impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: dream → renewed scrutiny of fairy ring → detection of patterns → mapping to wrecks → locket → Clara’s manifested memory and reinterpretation of the site. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a textural overlay, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where his understanding of the orchard—and his life’s work—shifts. Cost is more conceptual (decades of misprized effort, accepting his role as bridge-keeper) than concretely dramatized in the final beat, but it’s legible. Structure is linear and coherent for the length, with no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene is cleanly structured: restlessness → consultation of tea leaves → arrival of petitioner → divination and advice → the petitioner’s commitment to a path, giving a clear before/after. Causality holds under a mostly situational/causal hybrid lens; each beat follows a believable “because/therefore” chain. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—Lirael’s exile edges toward reversal and the woman’s options are reconfigured—but cost remains abstract since the sacrifice is only talked about, not tested. Nothing breaks orientation; the stakes are just not materially tightened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single causal throughline from sensing dissonance → deciding to act → performing the ritual → visible magical outcome → reconfigured understanding. Orientation is excellent, and the closure unit (ritual succeeds; heirloom gone, blossom left) is fully on-page. The major weakness is the lack of real obstruction or complication: once she decides to use the seed, each step works as described, so escalation feels relatively frictionless. Cost is present but mild, keeping this out of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with causal progression: Mara works the net → hush intensifies → net breaks → light → key → reframing of the fisherman’s “secret” → Mara’s reorientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctuary’s weight of silence is lifted, replaced by a “hum,” and Mara chooses to leave with the key. Causality is generally sound, though the appearance of the key verges on arbitrary magic rather than a fully foreshadowed mechanism. Stakes are modest and conceptual, but legible and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: map → films → discovery of the crack → journey to henge → ritual actions → chapel and conceptual shift. Structure is cleanly two-stage (vault then henge/chapel) with no orientation issues, and closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing of the “tear” and “silence.” The main weakness is that the path from puzzle to solution never truly imperils his goal; nothing meaningfully resists him once he acts. Still, the throughline is coherent and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present exploration in the library, interleaved with concise backstory, builds to the discovery of the pattern in Earhart’s transmission and a conceptual revaluation of Elara’s research. Causal links are legible (wreck → tape → hum → tuning fork/snow globe frequency → quantum-communication hypothesis → redefinition of “letting go”). Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: she reframes her life’s work and sets a new private trajectory. The only soft spot is how quickly the leap to “primitive quantum communication” is asserted rather than tested in-scene, which slightly reduces the felt cost and rigor of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: arrive, encode messages to three recipients, storm crests, quiet resolution. Causality is modest but coherent—he comes specifically to use the courtyard and ghost-in-code to offload secrets, and the storm and plate reprise frame the closing beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with the sense his messages are held, even if outcomes remain unknown. The cost and before/after divide are delicate, so the ending is satisfying but not deeply reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: elevator ascent as temporal spine, discovery of diary/goggles as midpoint deepening, confrontation with the widow as closure. Causality under a hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens holds: Mara’s choices to investigate and then to reveal change the widow’s stance and reweight the captain’s death. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the spire shifts from prison/cursed relic to “lens,” and grief from smothering ice to shelter for a surviving flame. Stakes remain intimate and mostly emotional, but they are coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous drift-scene that accrues significance as her observations build toward a conceptual re-framing of the sky. The causal throughline (grant loss → risky ride → string break → free drift → realization) is coherent, and the closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with her choice to surrender control. Cost (career loss, isolation, surrendering conventional safety) is implicit rather than dramatized, which keeps it short of top-tier impact. Still, the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is clear and held to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: commission → noticing the empty shelf → coin indentations → secret safe → journal’s revelation → choice to encode the stars in her painting → demolition forcing her exit. The demolition tests (rumble, first blow) provide a concrete ticking clock that narrows options and gives the closure real cost: the library is lost, the legacy survives only via the hidden safe and her work. Closure reads as a small but clear decisive change with cost, though the final stretch leans slightly more on summary than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: phrasebook → hopscotch puzzle → birds’ patterns → portal → encounter with the stranded luminance → return with new knowledge. Structure is straightforward and appropriate to the length, with one main escalation line and a clear closure beat when she returns changed. The main weakness is the light cost: the portal appears and resolves without real resistance or complication, and the ease of both surviving the leap and returning feels somewhat convenient. The “stranded luminance” itself reshapes understanding conceptually but doesn’t clearly change the practical stakes for Lira or the world on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecies → Hall of Mirrors → odd reflection → vial → alcove → chest → gears. Structure holds as a single, continuous quest scene with a clear mid-beat turn at the false reflection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive plot turn, but it’s legible and earned. The stakes and price are mostly internal and modest, keeping this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: crumbling arches → Elara’s chalk messages → settlers mobilize → arch is saved → Elara fades. Orientation is strong and the structural arc (problem, plan, execution, result) reads smoothly, with closure via the reinforced arch and sustained nebula. The main weakness is how frictioless the resolution feels—no serious setback, doubt, or sacrifice disrupts the straight line from plan to success. Closure is present and legible, but the lack of real jeopardy or cost blunts its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → activation of pane via the puppet → realization of the method → lullaby → global softening of time → shattering of tools and reframed understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s end becomes a gentle, inevitable act that she completes at real cost. The drive is largely accumulative/textural but remains coherent, and the stakes do not drift. Some beats (e.g., “vouchsafe the final ripple of time”) are more told than felt as decisions, keeping it just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation and causal flow are very clean: Kael hears the cry, consults the nut/blueprint, marks paths, reaches the fountain, opens the door, and gets the traveler through before frost and birds close in. The drive lens is Causal, and each step follows as a “therefore” from the curse’s constraints and his prior deciphering of the map. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the traveler is saved, the labyrinth resets, and the curse exacts its ongoing price. The only missed opportunity is a sharper on-page sense that any misstep could have produced a different concrete outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: coming to the ravine to atone → foam insight about separation → willingness to go to the studio → tentative reconnection → later joint ritual and life changes. Structure as a few linked shards (ravine, studio, weeks later) is clear and chronologically coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: their relationship and Elara’s work both reoriented by the “separation isn’t an end” insight, with on-page gestures (the composition, new polymers) showing the after-state. The cost—letting go of rigid grief and facing shared memory—is present but somewhat underplayed, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a calm opening, the disruptive visit from the man, then a reflective evening coda culminating in the drifting note and insight. Causality is coherent—his purchase destabilizes her worldview and primes the closing repricing of “beginnings.” Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting when the glimmer returns and she reframes how stories start, with a legible before/after in understanding. The cost is subtle (unsettling doubt more than true loss), so the ending is satisfying but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: from kitchen corridors to forbidden pavilion, to confrontation with the pool and aftermath in the kitchen, all in one continuous arc. Causality is solid—rain leaks remorse, drawing him to the pavilion; his choice to immerse himself leads to the founder’s memory and a reweighted present. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress’s emotional climate shifts as he carries diluted guilt into his cooking. Stakes are modest and internal, but they are coherent and fully pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece runs as a single, clearly anchored nocturnal scene with an accumulative/textural drive: Elara works, the tower responds, the village gathers, and the tower’s role is reconfigured. Causality is soft but coherent: repairing the weight, singing in many languages, and the tower’s “listening” all build toward the midnight chime and communal shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the tower becomes a “symphony” and social bridge, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the path feels almost inevitable and unopposed, so the structural turn lacks bite despite its clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation and structure are clean: one scene, one POV, clear goal (repair/transform the mirror) and a legible progression from preparation to experiment to result. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with a conceptual flourish at the end: because he repairs the mirror via his method, he accesses entangled memories and redefines his role. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the world’s rules and his identity shift—but the cost is mild, with the threat of psychic overwhelm dissipating quickly. No major causality breaks, but the resolution feels relatively low-strain for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: prior research → grotto → tunnel choice → manuscript → threshold effect → gravity inversion → discovery of keys → return. The live clock and rule of gravity inversion are legible and paid off, and the piece lands a clear closure unit with Lira leaving as someone redefined by what she’s found. However, the central quest unfolds without serious setback or complication, making the journey feel a bit too smooth for the stakes implied. The cost of success is more conceptual than dramatized, which slightly blunts the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the stump → experimentation with insulator → repeated practice → climactic shattering and brief symphony → aftermath of teaching the grove and long-term resonance. Causality is coherent and accumulative-textural: her persistence and technique lead directly to the stump’s release and the grove’s transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world that was silent now carries a humming, self-sustaining music with the insulator’s loss as price. Stakes and costs could be felt more sharply, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrive at nexus → place stone → silence/visions → keyhole → key → mage → seed → sapling, with no glaring logic gaps. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is redefined as a living pattern enacted through Alaric, not a lost document, and the star-sapling marks an on-page “after.” Cost is more conceptual than visceral—his exile and long effort are invoked but not tested or deepened in-scene—so the closure feels elegant rather than hard-won. Drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with strong thematic repricing) and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain (locked diary → experimental frequency-hack → reading → revaluation of silence) is clean and easy to follow, with a satisfying on-page closure in her reconfigured stance toward her grandmother’s silence. The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens and maintains that pattern without breaking. That said, the lock’s difficulty and the emotional/ethical stakes of opening the diary never quite tighten beyond a gentle puzzle. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-pressure, with little sense of an option foreclosed at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: receiving the seed → over-managing it → dream-induced realization → shift to patient presence → bloom that reconfigures the village’s stance. Orientation in time and place is strong, and the story maintains a single throughline without digressions. Closure lands via both a decisive external change (the bloom) and an internal reconfiguration, though the sense of risk or what’s truly at stake if she fails remains modest. The grandmother’s dream as turning point is convenient but foreshadowed enough by family tradition not to feel arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: arrow tip anomaly → guided flight → cavern → socket → activation → realization of symbiosis. The drive lens reads as Causal with a clear discovery pivot that redefines the premise. Closure lands via both a decisive act (inserting the tip) and conceptual repricing (planet as symbiotic archive rather than machine). The main weakness is that the apparent permanent inversion threat dissipates quickly and painlessly, softening the sense of risk and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation → anomalous readings → physical escalation via wind → discovery of the engineer → conceptual reframing of the port as “machine.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a tangible outcome (yard redesign recommendation, awareness that “some machines…never truly sleep”). A few beats lean on convenient convergence (patch vibration, engineer alive on top with a synced device) that are accepted rather than earned in detail. Still, the structure holds under a causal–conceptual hybrid lens with no serious orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: Lira enters with a goal, engages the environment, escalates via the song, and achieves a resonant reconfiguration in which the cavern and sculptor are transformed. Causality is solid under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—her song triggers the physical changes and Veyra’s awakening, and the final bell strike and aurora flare close the loop. Closure is present and legible: the world moves from “sculpted hush” to an ongoing hymn, with wonder repositioned as inevitable rather than optional. The main limitation is the relatively soft sense of risk or potential failure; the outcome feels assured from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: uncase → play at Veil’s Edge → staircase opens → descent and vision → mis-use of flute → break → new understanding and surface return. Structure stays within a single, clearly anchored episode (with one underground “shard”) and closes on a legible reconfiguration of Kael’s path. The mentor’s spectral interventions escalate rather than deus-ex-machina the conflict, and the final rearrangement of driftwood seals the before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost rather than a mechanical twist.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Elias’s plan to disorient the fragment leads to an experiment that spirals, forcing a transformative confrontation with empathy. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the scene unfolds in a coherent, escalating sequence without temporal or spatial confusion. Closure lands as a decisive change in understanding and relation to the fragment, with a clear before/after in how Elias approaches emotion. The structure is straightforward rather than intricate, but fully sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: journey → mysterious contact → receipt of seed → decision to plant → magical germination → revaluation of Veyra’s absence. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the piece holds a single, continuous scene with no structural confusion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Kail re-understands his role and Veyra’s disappearance through the sapling and silenced pendant. The cost and stakes remain modest and mostly internal, which keeps this shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: arrive to test → channel emotions → arbor responds → visions overload → glass/frost shatter → conceptual reversal. The closure is a clear conceptual repricing of the premise (mirror vs absorber) with an earned felt cost. Structure is straightforward but effective, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. It stops just short of exceptional because escalation and complication remain relatively narrow and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: silence → villagers flee, Mara stays → bead + loom → puzzle box → assembly → second bead → message → sacrifice and new weaving. Structure scales well for the length, with one central throughline and a clear pivot at the arrival of the puzzle. Closure is strong: the sacrifice reconfigures options and the travelers’ later reports confirm a Decisive Change with cost. The rummage-sale box and the “washed up” puzzle arrive by coincidence and feel a bit convenient rather than fully grounded in the world’s logic, which slightly undercuts rigor at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: silk arrives → mines rumor → Jorin chooses to descend → encounter with Lira → trial with shards → core reconstitution → surface renewal; closure is decisive and on-page. The story keeps to a single throughline and one scene progression, so orientation is solid and there’s no lens confusion. However, the shard trial feels compressed and somewhat convenient—Lira declares the cost, Jorin endures with minimal struggle, and the orb assembles itself—so escalation and resolution feel outlined rather than fully dramatized. The planetary healing at the end is abrupt and risk-free once the orb appears, softening the sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → portal focus → jump → encounter with mother-variant → explained danger/choice → deliberate destruction of the shard → quiet return. The structure (two bays, two states of the same platform) is elegant and easy to follow, with a clear before/after. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he forecloses further jumps and truths by hurling the shard into the portal. The cost—giving up the possibility of recovering his mother or more knowledge—is legible, though it could be made more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: lamp failure → discovery of glass/note → participation in the chain → accumulation of notes → revaluation of what “light” means, all in a single, legible throughline. Causality holds and the reflective passages anchor to present stimuli. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from solitary keeper of physical light to participant in a shared, symbolic one, with a before/after that’s clear. The main weakness is that external stakes (ships, danger) are gestured at more than dramatized, so structural pressure stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: prepare the ritual → attempt vision → shadows intensify and turn alive → she commits to shaping the dawn. Causality works on a local scale, and the piece clearly uses an accumulative/lyric drive where images and sensations build to a stance. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her conceptual understanding of dawn as “a choice” and her readiness—but the cost of that stance is soft and mostly abstract. The global drive and stakes could be tightened by sharpening what failure or mis-seeing would entail.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: the wing’s activation leads to the light, which leads to the travelers’ story, the wing’s disappearance, and Lin’s reconfiguration of purpose. Causality is gentle but coherent, and the accumulative/textural drive (light, mist, wing, heart) culminates in a clear conceptual repricing of her life after the transplant. Closure is on the page and legible; the before/after of how she uses her new “lens” is explicit. Stakes and turns are quiet but satisfy the scope of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean, linear structure: task → sextant investigation → wall becoming permeable → root corridor → quiet realization. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing (sorrow and maintenance reframed as language and beauty), but it carries little concrete cost. The pin-dropping setup creates the expectation of a sharper external turn that never quite materializes. Overall, the accumulative drive is coherent, yet the story’s turns are gentle rather than decisively narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the child’s song, channeling it through the mica window, then humming to ignite the fruit and realm, with a clear before/after. The accumulative/textural drive (song → fruit → light → social memory) holds, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an ongoing task rather than a hard solve. Causality is mostly solid, though resistance is minimal and success comes smoothly once she commits to humming. The cost is present but more gestured at than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: invitation → password → hidden library → blank book → map → mirrors → key → letters → internal shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Eleanor redefines hiding and chooses to remain, newly oriented to her grief and the Society. The structure is linear and legible, with one primary scene flow and no orientation problems. However, the turns are gentle; the story never tightens to a truly fraught decision, so the cost at closure is more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the tea house → impossible bread → emergent garden → daily tending → encounter with the woman → reframing of “creeping normality.” Causality is gently handled but coherent, with the magical substitutions (bread to seed) and fast-growing saplings forming a clear pattern that culminates in conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is solidly on the page: Elias’ understanding of the world’s “cracks” and his role shifts in a way that reweights the entire piece. Stakes are modest and primarily conceptual, which limits how far the structural tension can rise.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scene is cleanly structured: fading magic → attempt with first slide (partial success) → higher-stakes attempt with second slide → brief flare and near-loss → dawn-stabilized resolution. Causality holds and the closure beat (dawn brightening the illusions after she reconstructs vows) reads as a Decisive Change, though the cost of success feels light and dawn’s “assist” borders on convenient rather than hard-earned. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the drive lens (primarily causal with accumulative texture) stays consistent. Overall strong but not razor-tight in terms of on-page price for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: overheard intel → bargain with seller → climb to bell → confrontation and destruction of the device, all under an explicit time constraint. Closure lands with a decisive change (device destroyed, sale thwarted) and an earned reconfiguration of Lira’s stance toward her father via the cracked but still-ticking watch. Some beats feel a touch convenient or under-complicated (the overheard merchants and the seller’s “token” demand pay off very quickly and smoothly). Overall, structure is sound and fully publishable, but not yet surprising in its turns.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story has a clean causal spine: compass anomaly → journey to bluff → sensory escalation → revelation from Lira → conceptual reframing at the end. The closure is a solid conceptual repricing: Kael’s understanding of the compass and of the world’s agency is reweighted with a tinge of regret. Events track logically and the single-scene structure is easy to follow. The main limitation is that the turns feel more like observed phenomena than hard-pressured choices, which keeps the structural stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: attic lock leads him to the cave; painting yields the shadow-door; the lock physically “opens” his internal block. The piece reads as largely accumulative/textural with a clear causal spine, and orientation (who/where/why now) is solid early on. Closure exists as a decisive inner change (he answers the call and resumes true art), but the transformation unfolds with little resistance or complication, so the climax feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won. Still, the before/after is legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: postal plate → treasure map → Sector 7-B → Room 12 → confrontation with keeper → new understanding of the Archive and Elara’s decision. Orientation is clear from the opening and the story holds a single, coherent scene with one transition (surface → 7-B) and a legible climax in the vault. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the Archive is revealed as echoes repurposed by the AI, yet revalued as “seed” for new growth. The cost—learning her mother’s original words are gone—is present but underplayed relative to its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the iceberg fragment → building the kinetic sculpture → its performances as the ice melts → final transformation when the last droplet falls. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration as the symphony shifts from ice-driven to enduring structure, with the melt as conceptual cost. Closure is squarely on the page and the before/after is legible. The lack of significant complication or reversal keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic drift → glitches and fraying seals → need to handle the box → controlled burn → orb integration → settled equilibrium with the farm. Structure is straightforward single-POV, single-situation with a clear inciting condition and a recognizable climax. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration (Clara’s integration of the fears and re-seeing of the dome) but the cost of the act feels lightly sketched; success comes on the first attempt with minimal complication. Still, the before/after line is legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Clara’s routine → discovery of locket → gathering neighborhood stories → decoding the lock → reading the letters. Structure stays within a straightforward single-POV frame and lands solid closure when the mailbox opens and the letters are read, with a clear before/after in knowledge. The key insight about the combination feels a bit convenient but still stems from established details (the dates in the locket photograph). Stakes are modest but coherent, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: descent → discovery of dice → holographic dance puzzle → journal decoding → vial revealed → drones attack → dance-based escape. The piece delivers on its central drive (retrieve the antidote and decode the legacy) and closes with a clear before/after in Kael’s stance. Cost and danger feel slightly underplayed in the climax; the drones are neutralized quickly once he dances, softening the sense of real risk. Still, the structure holds tightly within a single, legible scene and achieves a resonant closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: coffee-ground pattern → wall panel → tunnel → rose → revelation about where memories go, with no orientation issues. Closure is present as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: Elias reframes the pockets of gravity from devourers to preservers and gains a new purpose. However, the path through the tunnel is almost frictionless—no real setbacks or dilemmas—and the system’s logic (how/why the salt stores memories, why the rose unlocks them) is accepted quickly without resistance or cost. The result is structurally sound but feels somewhat under-tested and convenient for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: prophecy → preparation → ritual at the brook → prophecy hushed. Structure is clean—a single scene with a clear beginning, middle, and end—and closure lands (the prophecy will not manifest). However, the outcome feels pre-ordained; no attempt fails, no constraint meaningfully narrows options, and the cost of success is negligible (an origami wing turning to dust). Under a causal lens, the story reads more like a successful procedure than a pressured decision with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: rooftop meeting → revelation about their past lies and the architect → time-bound opportunity with the Leonids → decision to activate the seal → the library answers. Structure is tight for the length, with one clear escalation from conversation to ritual. However, stakes and cost remain soft; we’re told the building is a guardian and the language is “sleeping,” but what might be lost or risked by waking it is never concretely framed. Closure lands as a decisive change (the voice answering) but without a strongly felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: present-tense ritual in the garden, intercut with one key childhood memory, builds logically to the shell-circle climax and her departure. Causality is coherent (shell → memory surfacing → ritual → garden’s dissolution → inner shift), and the before/after is unmistakable. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration—she leaves with a different stance toward her past and herself. The cost is somewhat muted (the garden and its roses vanish without real contest or consequence beyond tone), which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear task (forge and seal the treaty, then hide it) that completes on the page, giving solid closure. The inferred drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with situational pressure from the implied stakes of war and history; that lens holds to the end. However, the cost of her action remains mostly conceptual and deferred to “the heirs,” so the before/after shift in her own options is modest. The sanctuary niche and her exit under aurora give a resonant cadence but not a strongly escalated causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a linear ascent guided by the seashell, a mid-beat revelation in the fissure, and a culminating explanation at the stone circle. Causality is intact—each step (he listens, hears more, climbs, meets the figure) follows logically and deepens the central question. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s understanding of echoes shifts from mysterious acoustics to a moral/aesthetic vocation to steward trapped stories, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. The drive reads as Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, and that lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—present shrine frame plus three dreams—reads cleanly and builds toward a coherent closure image. Causality is soft but sufficient: Kael arrives with goal and object, the dreams reveal the sailor’s relational knots, which in turn motivate his decision on how to act. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with the snow globe on the altar and the plan to send truths via dreams. The main limitation is that options and stakes never feel meaningfully narrowed, so the before/after shift is conceptual rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates sensory and symbolic detail toward a conceptual realization. Causality under an accumulative lens is coherent—whistle → following sound → noticing pattern → reinterpretation of “moon paths.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the before/after line is soft because little in his options or world actually changes besides his phrasing of an already-aligned worldview. Still, the arc is legible and neatly contained, with no orientation issues or broken set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Crane’s disappearance → letters → revelation of the stillpoint → descent and sealing choice, all under a clear Causal drive. Orientation is strong from the opening: who she is, where we are, and what’s wrong with the world are established quickly. Closure is decisive and on-page (she seals the stillpoint; the world-state shifts), with a legible cost in lost potential and unresolved human mystery. Some turns—especially the fissure opening and the exact rule of the two diamonds—arrive a bit conveniently via exposition rather than earned complication, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: storm → radio riddles → hourglass anomaly → prism mechanism → self-reframing, giving a clear conceptual before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where Kael reframes himself as both conduit and force, with the observatory becoming a threshold. Causality is light but coherent—because he follows the messages, he triggers the prism and the storm’s reconfiguration—though no choice meaningfully forecloses a path. Cost is mostly conceptual and lightly implied (further sacrifice of isolation, burden of “conducting” a turbulent dawn) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: loft setup → jars poured → village sequence → return to loft, with the music box as throughline. Causality is legible (jars enable the box, which in turn enables his village “performances”), and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration—Elias discovers and accepts his purpose, which reweights the earlier gathering of sounds. The cost is somewhat soft (no path is truly foreclosed or endangered), keeping it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: key destabilizes → Elias goes to marina with repurposed resonator → ghost appears to stop him → sonic confrontation → stabilization and conceptual reframing. The piece delivers one primary escalation—the sonic clash where frequencies collide—followed by a believable de-escalation into mutual understanding. Closure is solid (key stabilized, stance redefined), though the victory feels a bit easy, with minimal sense that failure was a live option for more than a few lines. Overall structure fits the length and maintains orientation effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: cold → heightened hum → mapping and failed attempt → refined method → successful unyoking → seasonal epilogue. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the central task provides a clear throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Kael succeeds and reorients his own stance—but the stakes of failure are kept abstract (no acute threat or irreversible loss), so the felt cost remains modest. The weeks-later montage supports the sense of continuity but does not introduce new structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara enters to investigate, uses the lantern, gains visions that reframe the accident, discovers files, then reinterprets her relationship with Cole and commits to a new course. The single-scene structure with embedded memory shards is easy to follow and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where she chooses a different use for both memory and her role. However, the hidden compartment with perfectly incriminating files and the convenient vision of young Cole carrying the same lantern feel somewhat contrived, reducing the sense of earned discovery. The cost at the end is more implied than dramatized, but her decision does clearly alter her options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: warden’s request → visit to shop → encounter with the inmate’s creation → re-evaluation and decision. Orientation (who/where/why) is established quickly and never wavers, and the scene moves logically to a conceptual reweighting of the program. Closure is present but gentle—a decision to support and enact the program, with cost mostly implied via the seriousness of prison context rather than dramatized. The structure is solid but not particularly surprising or structurally inventive.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causality is clean: arrow tip obsession → Old Thrum’s kaleidoscope hint → image-sequence decoding → alignment-triggered upheaval → flight → bell activation. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture, and closure is a decisive change (the unheard bell hums) with a conceptual cost (reality itself seems re-tuned). However, the path from recognizing the kaleidoscope as translator to flawlessly navigating to the bell is quite smooth; complications never seriously endanger the outcome. The cost at the end is more implied than embodied, which keeps the structure strong but not yet elite.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: curiosity about the patch → discovery of recurring numbers → Project Lazarus → video → coordinates → confrontation and flight. The single-scene structure with one night’s investigation escalating to a security breach works coherently, and the ending lands as a Charged Poise: she irreversibly commits to a new path with visible risk. Some beats (e.g., the instantaneous jump from coordinates to “derelict research station”) feel a bit convenience-driven rather than hard-won. Still, closure is solid, with a legible before/after and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: storm pressure → attic mirrors ritual → orchard deployment of the reconstituted fragment, all causally linked. The accumulative pattern of glimpses coheres and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world’s fear is given a “heart.” Cost is somewhat abstract; the story doesn’t dramatize what Elara risks personally or what would concretely happen if she failed. Still, the before/after is legible and the drive lens holds without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: euthanasia tourist → disaster relief work → eerie sound in ice → fissure/boat discovery → rescue → reflective revaluation at the marina. The piece uses a Hybrid drive (situational external rescue plus accumulative internal stance change), and the closure—Lila’s reconceived “fold in patience” and flicker of peace—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with modest but legible cost. However, the euthanasia-clinic thread feels under-integrated structurally, functioning more as backdrop than as an actively tightening constraint. Escalation is smooth but somewhat low-contrast, with the rescue resolved quickly once discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: pavilion → shared object → walk through vineyard → return and quiet reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative/textural lens, with each move growing out of the last. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final paragraph, reframing the pavilion and their relationship, though the cost is more implied than sharply dramatized. The piece feels complete and self-contained, but the decisive change is gentle rather than strongly crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prophet arrives → sages’ pressure → consecration → stabilized clearings and restored balance. Structure is straightforward—a central ritual scene followed by a quiet epilogue—and orientation is never in doubt. Closure exists as an earned stasis/charged poise (“For now”) but the cost of success is barely felt; nothing substantial is lost or risked on the page. As a result, the before/after shift is conceptually clear yet emotionally low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure—a present-day visit, reflection anchored in concrete stimuli, a quiet realization, then a next-day coda—reads cleanly and causally. The closure (reframing the factory as evolving rather than dying, and the “enough” inscription) is legible and earned as a Resonant Reconfiguration. That said, the cost of this shift is mostly implicit and modest; nothing truly forces the change besides contemplation. Within a lyric-accumulative lens it works, but it doesn’t feel indispensable or high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from contemplation, to the crystal-triggered insight, to a resolved internal stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: crystal → sharpened perception of patterns → decision to speak through his work. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration of growth and of his own role, but the felt cost is subtle and the "testify" thread remains more thematic than plot-driven. There are no orientation issues, but the narrative arc feels more like a deepened meditation than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous search framed by a clear goal (find the sound), iterative attempts (rearranging driftwood), and a culminating success that triggers an internal reconfiguration. Causality is straightforward—visions → markers → following the hum—without gaps or retroactive patches. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he gains the sound and relinquishes the old drive to “see” the future, with his past efforts reweighted by the final chalk mark. Stakes are modest but coherent for this scope, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tremor → clock malfunction → experimental fixes → realization about escape velocity → synchronization → portal → leap. Closure is decisive and on-page: he literally exits through the portal, foreclosing his old life. Stakes around what happens if he fails, or what he abandons, stay somewhat abstract, but the immediacy of the quakes and structural failure compensates. The piece holds a coherent causal lens from start to finish without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: we move from pre-bedside preparation, through the musical vigil and death, to a brief aftermath with Clara and a forward-looking coda. Causality is tight—Mira chooses the hymn, which prompts Elias’s partial “reunification” and leads to his peaceful death, then to the passing of the vinyl shard. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira cycles her method onward, bearing the emotional cost while committing to the work. The main ceiling is that the climax and coda follow a fairly expected emotional trajectory without a surprising structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: months of study → noticing the constellation alignment → using the key at the precise shadow moment → revelation of the gateway. The piece delivers a clear conceptual repricing closure—shadows as condensed gateways and the key as loop-closer—without losing orientation. However, the stakes of the sealed awakenings and the gateway remain abstract, so while the structure works, the impact of the final change is more intellectual than dramatically costly. Still, for this length, the single escalation into activating the dais is well timed and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear: Mara goes to the garden with tools and a plan, Elias appears with a second tooth, and their joint act with the fountain triggers the reconfiguration. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the garden’s magic is reframed as a mirror, the path out clears, and their relationship shifts. Cost is present but light—more conceptual/emotional than sharply dramatized—so the before/after is legible but not searing. Elias’s entrance feels a bit convenient, with little prior pressure suggesting why this moment forces his return.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure—a causal, mostly single-scene progression from entering the grotto to polishing to weighing to release—is clean and legible, with the brief surface-world coda tied clearly to the grotto work. Causality under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens holds: each step (select gem → polish → weigh → share → release) follows from the last and from Elara’s goal. Closure is solid via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “Light is a loan” is enacted when she returns the pearl to the sky. The cost is more philosophical than materially risky, which limits the intensity but not the coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by Elias’s arrival and return, with a clear before/after in how Lila relates to her grief and the pendant. Causality is modest but coherent (viral confession → meeting → pendant alteration → invitation to stay), and the accumulative drive through images (servers, moss, icicle pattern, pendant) resolves in a resonant reconfiguration of her stance on loss. The closure has on-page cost—risking “losing him twice” and opening herself to someone new—made explicit through action. The arc is emotionally persuasive though the external stakes remain low-key and could be tightened with one sharper, time-pressured or socially pressured beat related to the viral fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: journey to nexus → encounter with double → return and revise the manuscript, with a clear before/after in Clara’s stance. Causality is simple but coherent—whispering pages and shell prompt the visit; the encounter reorients her; she then rewrites the ending. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “endings” with a visible decision (deleting the last chapter). Stakes remain modest, but for this scale the arc is fully legible and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: set-up of the arbor’s sickness and the tendril, build toward the harvest moon, performance of the ritual, and a quiet denouement where the new order is articulated. Causality is intact—her song and the tendril’s power revive the woods and catalyze the community. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: from solitary tinkerer to communal tender of practices, with a clear before/after. What keeps it below top tier is the relative ease of success and lack of complication or reversal on the way to that outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous ritual, clearly causal (preparation → sealing → activation → realization → departure) with a discernible closure when Elias recontextualizes the map and chooses to withdraw to work. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pressure building via slow ritual rather than reversals, and that pattern holds. Cost and stakes (this may be his only successful attempt, the world waiting outside) remain more conceptual than dramatized, so closure lands softly rather than with full weight. Nothing breaks causality or orientation, but the arc is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a clear problem (broken timer), an investigation period (“across the lull of the wounded season”), and a climax when the device is restored and the echoes return. Causality holds well—the light studies, etchings, and gear alignment all feed the final success, and the closure lands as Elias reactivates the harvest and descends to the keepers. The drive reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the final reconfiguration of meaning (wonder can be stored yet remain alive) is legible. The main limitation is the relative lack of on-page cost or genuine risk, which keeps the climax from feeling structurally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival in grotto → series of burden-melting attempts with a harder central test (obsidian) → exit with a charged refusal at the mother’s niche → brief village coda. Causality is tight at this scale, and the accumulative rhythm of successive burdens leads naturally to the closing Earned Stasis around the locket. Closure lands as a modest but legible before/after: the grotto is lighter, Kael has more burdens in his satchel, and he consciously leaves one path (his mother’s hush) unchosen. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and procedural rather than acutely pressured, which keeps this strong but not yet formidable.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrive at loft → choose to carve → recall husband and method → complete lion → reframe loss, all under a single present-time frame. Causality is intact and legible under a textural lens, with each physical step of the carving process deepening the emotional drive rather than feeling like a list. Closure lands via an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she reconfigures loss as transformation and commits to carrying him forward through the carved lion. Escalation is modest and largely internal, but there is a discernible before/after in how she holds his absence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: scavenging → discovery of the wheel → dusk confrontation with the ghost → renunciatory act → rest and departure → fishermen epilogue, with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure lands on-page through Veyra’s choice to relinquish the “key” object, sleep without dreams, and then leave the shore—a Decisive Change supported by a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final rose/jar image. The short time jump to the fishermen is controlled and conceptually tight, extending consequences without muddying the lens. Stakes are more internal than external, which fits the piece but does somewhat limit the felt urgency of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → exploration → discovery of sextant → redirection of flows → projected equation → decision to return. Structure is linear and easy to follow with a legible before/after: a dead space becomes partially reanimated with a new purpose. Closure operates as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive plot turn, which fits the piece. The main limitation is that the structural arc is very smooth, with no real complications or reversals to deepen the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: workshop unease → forecourt encounter → bear/stone resonance → internal reconfiguration → return. Under an accumulative/situational lens, the pressure coheres as a quiet but steady progression, with the bear as the central tightening and the ending as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is solid—Lira’s relationship to the keep and her dream is clearly different with a visible opportunity cost. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, which is fine for length but keeps the plot from feeling fully urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is clean: canal → sundial points → warehouse → blueprint → realization, with clear causal links. The drive reads Hybrid (external search enabling an internal conceptual shift), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of what the sundial is. However, the stakes remain abstract, and the cost at the end is mostly implied (“required a willingness to confront the darkness within himself”) rather than dramatized. Orientation is solid from the opening, and there are no major causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: discovery of the fulgurite → decoding the rope → reinterpretation of the myth via the cloaked woman’s intervention → conceptual closure. Causality is coherent—each step arises from the last—and the Global Drive Lens reads as accumulative/textural with a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands: the realization about the weavers’ legacy reframes his quest and charges his choice to kneel and pair rope with glass again. The cost is subtle (accepting a lifelong task rather than a concrete “loom” prize) but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: Elara arrives with a goal, engages the thread, experiences a vision, and leaves with a reconfigured understanding and renewed commitment. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is subtle and mainly conceptual. Causality is intact but fairly gentle; nothing meaningfully resists her, and the “rules” of the ghost-weft are accepted without friction or complication. The piece feels complete, but the path there is smooth rather than dynamically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: long preparation with the contraption leads to the keening, the egg’s activation, the orb’s emergence, and the palace’s transformation. Closure is solid—a decisive change from dead mechanical stasis to living regrowth, with Corvin’s success reconfiguring the world’s trajectory. However, the key turn (the egg finally hatching) arrives with minimal on-page complication or cost; after the keening begins, events largely unfold without resistance. The years of struggle are mostly summarized rather than dramatized into specific tactical failures that would sharpen the final payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear: a quiet arrival at the lagoon, interruption by the family and injured bird, a small crisis, then a reflective coda. Causality holds—Lira’s history leads her here, the family’s arrival creates a concrete test, the bird’s release and Lira’s lingering yield conceptual closure. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: compassion as “carrying the weight” reframes scars and the earlier volcanic-fertility motif. Stakes remain modest and the emotional cost is relatively soft, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal breadcrumb quest structure is clean: each object recovered modifies the box and escalates toward the missing eighth piece. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the throughline from first fountain to final eruption is easy to track. The climactic vision of the marble is a bit convenient but still motivated by her demand to herself and the established memory-logic of the world. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change (memories freed, fountains restore) and a reconfigured inner stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: sonar urgency → guided journey → encounter with ancestor → conceptual reframe → symbolic act of leaving the gear. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the pinging and gear patterns lead to the grove, the conversation reinterprets the ban, and Lumin’s final choice follows. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—fire redefined as “quieter” light—and the gear left behind as a finite reminder works. The main weakness is the relatively untested cost: opposition from elders and societal stakes remain offstage and hypothetical.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-time greenhouse frame spanning the butterfly migration, with the spectral voice guiding Marlow toward the culminating act of reading his poem. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—repeated visits deepen knowledge until the final night triggers a stance shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief is re-priced as a bridge/door, and his future work is reoriented. The cost of that shift (the vulnerability and exposure of speaking his grief) is implied rather than dramatized in conflict-heavy terms, keeping this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: stalled pendulum → investigation at ridge → discovery of rake inscription → ritual with bob → tides and ridge restored. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after—Hush versus renewed swing and sealing cracks—which satisfies the DC/RR requirement. The main weakness is how smoothly the solution arrives once the rake appears; it feels like a conveniently perfect key with little resistance or risk in executing the ritual. Cost is present but light, so the ending is satisfying but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: discover object → examine tapestry → decode threads → conceptual realization → rebury with new understanding. Causality holds throughout, and the accumulative drive (each decoded thread deepens meaning) is coherent and legible. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing—seeing the cemetery work as gardening time as well as earth—with a quiet but clear before/after. The main limitation is that the plot’s stakes remain small and largely contemplative, so the final turn feels elegant but low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine—meticulous observation and “predictive modeling” leading to the thaw—is clear and holds from setup through payoff. Structure is clean: establish method and opposition, sketch the modeling, then move to the equinox test and aftermath. The closure (lake thaws, village options change, quill used up, journals burned) gives a decisive before/after with conceptual and practical cost. Some ellipsis around how writing influences reality (science vs magic) is handwaved but doesn’t break the internal logic at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from tuning in, to partial lyrics, to a key verse, to a quiet resolution and departure, with each step building her archive and resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she internalizes the pirate-broadcast role and steps back into the world with a clarified identity and ongoing cost (lonely, meticulous work). Causality is modest but clean—no orientation issues, no broken logic—though the narrative feels more like a mood piece than a scene with a sharp turn. The price of her path is present but understated, keeping this short of truly high-band structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: we move from set-up (Lira preparing to create) through the act of making the ash portrait to a quiet closure where she chooses to leave it unfinished and re-armors herself. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the beats line up: every pass reasserts impermanence and risk, culminating in the gallery “swallowing” her work as she walks away. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn; the before/after is legible—she has slightly clarified her stance on safety vs. truth—but the cost is conceptual more than viscerally felt. The causal chain is intact, though stakes stay mostly static and the gallery’s dangers, while mentioned, never quite force a structural crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single scene: set-up in the sewer, then the excavation and argument, then the quasi-astrolabe moment and continued digging. Causality is coherent—Mara’s challenge (“Fine. Prove it.”) prompts deeper digging and the construction of the cog–needle device. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses to go on digging, bleeding, and listening to the city’s “heartbeat” while she lingers in skeptical orbit. The cost and change are subtle but legible; a slightly sharper final beat of consequence would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Clara’s reflective purpose → Elias’s arrival and tentative playing → the widening circle of artists → the sanctuary-like closure. Causality is modest but coherent; each beat follows persuasively, and the rosette motif links past and present into a resonant final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library and choir become an active hedge against erasure, with implied social cost outside. What keeps this below the very top tier is that the most consequential moves (the growing choir, societal pushback) are summarized rather than dramatized, muting the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: alignment night → decision to prune → waves of memories → selective pruning toward gentler paths → future-vision bud and resolved stance about the greenhouse’s future. The story maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues; the drive lens is primarily causal with a touch of accumulative texture through layered memories. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the plant is irrevocably altered and Elara’s role expands from solitary rebel to seed-planter for a communal future. The main structural limitation is that the process never feels close to failing; there’s little sense that another outcome was truly possible tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: blackout → missing drones → lacquer box → riddle/explanation → Clara’s decision → public address and partial restoration. Structure is straightforward single-POV with a clear inciting incident and a conceptual repricing closure focused on the tower’s true dependence on wonder. Cost and resistance are somewhat soft—the city accepts the revelation easily and the system restarts with minimal friction—so the climax reads more declarative than hard-won. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: present action (ritual at the bay) interleaved with just enough backstory to frame the displaced-object theory, culminating in a clear before/after shift when the bay is sanctified. Causality is straightforward—she arranges the objects, the air thickens, the glow and “sanctification” follow—and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing of hush and “alive” houses. That said, there’s no meaningful setback or complication; everything works on the first try, which softens the sense of cost. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent but a bit too smooth for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: Mara arrives, Lumen directs her to the pedestal’s weakness, she retrieves the ampoule, gains revelations, and chooses to drink it, leading to the garden’s reactivation and the blight’s recession. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end (her grandmother’s “death” reconsidered as sacrifice). The main weakness is the blocky exposition of “first revelation… second… third,” which compresses what could be dramatized turns into a summary. Closure is nonetheless clear and on-page, with a tangible decisive act and world-level consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: pacing/experimentation on the staircase → conceptual breakthrough via rupture → reconfiguration of goal at the end. Causality is coherent (proofs → chosen rupture point → dice orbit), and we get a clear before/after shift when he achieves perpetual motion yet relinquishes possession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but the cost (remaining in the staircase, letting the dice go) is legible. Stakes stay somewhat abstract and inward, which slightly mutes the sense of structural “snap” at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story tracks cleanly from sleepless setup through ritual with the brush, imaginative bridge to Elena, and the catalytic arrival of Mr. Voss. Causality is coherent: the moonlit experiment with lost language and eyes leads directly to Mr. Voss’s recognition and the conceptual reweighting that follows. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lila’s stance shifts from abstract doubt to committed apprenticeship in a “slow tongue.” Stakes stay intimate and could tolerate one more concrete obstacle or risk, but for a quiet piece the arc is satisfying and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clear and coherent: tour with lens → private baking and resolve → communal festival and charged final image, with a clean accumulative/textural drive. Causality is soft but present (reflection on decline leads to concrete plans), and the shift from solitary custodian to active reviver reads as the closure unit (resonant reconfiguration). However, pressure on decisions is minimal, and obstacles never seriously threaten her goal; things unfold smoothly once she decides to act. The cost of her new path is mostly implicit (effort, emotional risk) rather than sharply defined in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: hunger stone discovery → first failed attempt with the yoyo → revised mechanism with mercury and coil → lighthouse reactivation and path revealed. The piece operates under a clear Causal lens, and the closure is a Decisive Change: the world’s rules (time/light) visibly shift as Elias crosses toward the tower. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized, lodged in ominous hints (the stone’s deepening hunger, island shudder), which keeps this just shy of top-tier. Structure stays cleanly in one continuous scene without temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara enters the funhouse because of her curse and resuscitation, the dictionary prescription dictates her tactic, and her paradoxical “welcome” triggers the shadow’s unraveling. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with rising pressure and lands a decisive change (shadow destroyed, cloak permanently altered) plus a conceptual tilt about truth and fear. Cost is present but relatively light—her seared hand and implied psychic risk, not a major sacrifice—which keeps the climax from feeling fully weighty. Overall structure is solidly publishable but not yet exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clean: she prepares, tunes, layers sound, reaches a peak (clouds fracturing, orchard shuddering), and lands in a reconfigured quiet. Causality within the ritual is coherent—shifts in her technique (angle on the plank, moving to the lightning-scarred tree) yield escalating responses in clouds, apples, and structure. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: chaos into a stable mosaic and “ghost” composition in the air. The main limit is that cost and risk remain relatively soft; success never feels truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: crack → tunnel → journal → revelation → city awakening, with each beat tightening options and knowledge under a coherent drive lens. The closure—a conceptual repricing that the gate kept them in and the watchers were warning them—lands firmly and reweights everything prior with real conceptual cost. Some conveniences (her mother’s journal surviving and waiting precisely where she arrives, the watchers entering right then) are a bit neat but don’t break plausibility. Structure is linear and well-contained for the word count, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → petal warning → letter A as clue → Tomas’s prompt → tunnel → chamber with T → revaluation of the manifesto and decision to rewrite history. The piece follows a clear investigative spine with one main escalation (entering and traversing the tunnel) and a conceptual turn at the chamber that reconfigures the entire backstory. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: truth as seed, noble lies as survival tool, and Elara’s new project. The only structural softness is that the “final petal” clock doesn’t significantly alter choices once it’s triggered, lessening perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: surveying → placing the first note → strange groan → hatch → secret chamber → recognition → second note and reframed stance. The story maintains a single coherent scene with one transition (surface to chamber) and lands a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Closure is solid: Elara leaves with new knowledge and a reweighted understanding of absence and legacy. The main weakness is that the key discoveries arrive without serious obstacles or complications, so structural tension is moderate rather than tight.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → investigation of the sound → discovery and decoding of the door → journal revelation → resolved decision to surface with the truth. Orientation is solid from early on (who/where/what she wants is clear), and the story sustains a single throughline without digressions. The closure unit reads as a conceptual repricing and stance crystallization: Lira reframes the blackout and chooses to carry Elara’s history outward, with an implied burden. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, though, so the ending feels resonant but not fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense task (crafting a lantern) interwoven with past trauma, building to the shadow’s return and her confrontational stance. Causality holds: her decision to record the dream triggers the basilica’s reaction, the light show, and the cranes’ animation, setting the stage for the shadow encounter. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Decisive Change—she chooses to face the shadow and it dissolves—but the cost is more implied than dramatized in that final beat. The drive lens reads as Hybrid leaning accumulative/textural and stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong: observatory → scan → node → descent → entry → backlash → new crystal and role, with each step a “because/therefore” escalation. Structure is clean single-POV, single spine, and the closure—observatory and node gone, new crystal in hand, new mission—lands as a decisive change with cost (she’s severed from Orion’s full support, from the old life, from safety). The only limitation is that the mechanics of the node’s disappearance and the observatory’s loss are sketched in conceptual rather than dramatized physical terms, softening the sense of concrete consequence. Still, the before/after border is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: track pilgrim → observe alignment → recognize chip gaps → pull lever → reveal fragments → assemble chip → conceptual shift about belonging. Single-scene structure is tight and orientation is excellent, with no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the premise rather than a decisive change, but the cost—embracing uncertainty and open-ended listening—is only softly implied. The lack of a more pressured or consequential choice at the lever or afterward keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal flow—terrace to shore to discovery to decision—is clean and legible, with the driftwood method naturally escalating toward the revelation about the erased brother. The structure fits a single-POV, two-location shard and lands in a decisive choice to tell Lila the truth, giving a clear before/after. The magicalized mechanics of driftwood memory-reading feel accepted but are not fully grounded, pushing this slightly toward fable rather than tight causal realism. Still, closure occurs on the page with a felt cost and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: a parapet prelude, the arrival of Elias, the descent to the exchange, and a reflective coda, with causal continuity throughout. The drive reads as Situational/Hybrid—pressure comes from the stakes and history rather than plot twists—and closure lands via Clara’s choice to drop the pull (a Resonant Reconfiguration of how she holds her mistakes). Yet the core on-page event, the exchange itself, is summarized as “went smoothly,” sidestepping a potential inciting turn or complication that could deepen the arc. As a result, the decisive change operates mostly on a symbolic interior plane rather than as a structural pivot under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: launch → solo paddle → lighthouse confrontation → decision to leave the compass → return toward town, with each step causally following Clara’s prior choice. Closure is solidly on the page: she abandons the inherited tool and commits to a new mode of navigation, with an implied cost of leaving both her grandfather’s mythology and her old patterns. The drive lens reads as situational with accumulative texture, and it holds consistently. Stakes are narrow but legible, and nothing essential feels unearned or retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious baseball → research in archives → map → descent to lake → confrontation with possible selves → changed stance on the surface. The single-scene journey structure is appropriate for the length and easy to follow, with no orientation or lens confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara accepts that she cannot erase but can reinterpret and “read the world more carefully,” which reweights the opening premise. The cost—facing the pain of her foreclosed lives and carrying that awareness onward—is present but somewhat under-dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Lira’s mandate → preparation with spices/animals → decision under pressure → metamorphosis → renewed bond. The piece maintains a single, continuous scene with clear orientation and a tightly focused drive toward completing or refusing the ritual. Closure lands as a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration—she becomes a bridge, and the bond is transformed instead of broken. The only thing holding this below the very top band is that external consequences or altered options after the ritual are more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: arrival and set-up of ritual → opening of the saucer’s crack → ascent to the tree and vision of the mother → fall and re-grounded return. Causal links are clear under a largely accumulative/lyric lens: each small ritual action unlocks the next deepening of the encounter with lost time. Closure lands with a credible resonant reconfiguration—she no longer needs to hover in cloudbound penance because her relationship to time and her mother has shifted—though the cost remains primarily emotional and could be edged with one more concrete foreclosed option. Orientation and world rules are legible despite the surrealism, and there are no dropped set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: a failing ship and dimming relic force Lira into the meditation chamber, where engaging in shadow work allows her to open the locked dimension and stabilize the *Eirenicon*. The structure is a tight single-arc scene with a decisive on-page change (the door opening, the Tear shattering, the ship stabilizing) and no orientation issues. The main weakness is that no beat seriously threatens failure once she commits; the process reads as smooth rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → journey to beach → release of bugs → revelation about prophecies → final choice to listen, yielding a clear before/after in Lira’s understanding. The structure holds as a single, continuous scene with one significant tightening when the man offers “the last piece of the prophecy.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: she redefines her work and accepts a quieter, messier notion of transformation at a palpable emotional cost. Stakes remain fundamentally internal and modest, which keeps the piece from feeling structurally towering but not from being coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → chance to act → sundial deciphered with quill holder → hidden chamber revealed → revolution infrastructure accessed. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear inciting incident and on-page closure via the discovery of the cradle. That said, obstacles are minimal and the Council’s “test” never manifests as real interference, so turns feel a bit frictionless. The before/after is legible, but the cost of that transition is largely conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Lira’s sequences with the rocks provoke star dust reactions, which in turn trigger visions and eel movement, culminating in a reconfigured stance toward the patterns. The structure is linear, anchored in one scene, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she redefines what the promise and her “task” mean. Cost is present but somewhat muted; the threatened annihilating storm never quite materializes as more than a vision, so the risk feels slightly theoretical. Still, the drive lens (Hybrid leaning causal/accumulative) is consistent and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: storm vigil → reading the cartographer’s poem → internal reckoning → composing and sealing his own piece to send out. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens: the storm, timer, and envelope all intensify pressure until the final decision, which clearly alters his future options and risk exposure. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from hiding to active defiance with a felt cost (Ministry danger implied, safety relinquished). There are no orientation issues or missing beats, though the external threat remains offstage rather than materially tightening in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear causal chain from duel → revelation of map → shift to joint quest, with closure landing as a shared decision to “follow the map.” The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational conflict plus conceptual repricing), and the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration of their relationship and the card’s meaning. Stakes and costs, however, remain largely conceptual; the duel never truly threatens to disrupt their bond or foreclose options, so the sense of “before/after” is more intellectual than felt. Strong but not quite at elite-level tightness in terms of visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night in the library with a clear spine—Cedar’s recurring visits to the tin under the floorboard and the current molting. Causality is modest but coherent: his pattern of rebuilding → present return → on-page molt → discovery of the unfamiliar poem → conceptual shift. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from fear of fragmentation to embracing “becoming the anarchy,” with the cost being his acceptance that the instability is permanent. Stakes could be tightened by making the risk of losing himself or the library more concrete, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: restless in the arbor → remembers the reel → views hidden-room footage → discovers the staircase → plays in the refuge. The structure is essentially single-scene with a purposeful descent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her relationship to fate and refuge shifts. Cost is gentle and interior—there’s no concrete penalty for her choice—but the before/after (restless, caged trance vs. charged, chosen refuge) reads clearly. The accumulative texture of clocks, compasses, tides, and film supports a coherent, hybrid causal/accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: plant the seed → enter the land’s dreams → identify the fracture and its root in fear → make a choice that stabilizes memory. The shift into the dream-cavern is clearly signaled and structurally legible, and the final return to the ridge provides a distinct before/after. Closure is present—her stance toward the monsoon and memory changes—but the resolution feels low-cost and almost frictionless once the seed touches the pool. The piece reads as a well-shaped single arc but lacks a sharper, more consequential turn where failure feels briefly plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a coherent causal chain: compass → lace ritual → journey → ghost encounter → shared apology → calm sea and quiet coda. The “severance” premise and the compass’s behavior are introduced early enough that the later supernatural turn feels earned. Closure is solid—Lira’s relationship to her father’s absence decisively shifts, and Yorick returns to an altered stasis with the lace as reminder. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal; once the method is explained, events proceed without real complication.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.6)
    The structure violates scope defaults by relying on summary ("monitored it daily") and a significant time jump ("Weeks later") to reach the ending. This dissipates the scene's immediate pressure and reduces the narrative to a montage.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    A significant causality gap undermines the rising action: Lirael decides to use frost to decode the ledger before having any evidence that this specific method acts as the key. The climax relies on a convenient projection that explains the plot rather than an earned discovery or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on montage ("Days passed," "By winter's end") rather than a focused scene, violating the short-story scope. There is no singular decisive moment with visible cost; the tension dissipates into a summary of professional success.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative bridges the inciting incident and the climax with summary ("For days, Elias worked") rather than dramatized struggle. Causality is weak; the protagonist "books passage" to a supposedly forgotten city without logistical friction, and the dream serves as a convenient plot mover.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is solid, and the shift from anonymity to named solidarity creates a clear closure effect. However, the investigation phase is summarized rather than dramatized, bypassing potential tension, and the conflict resolves with convenient speed.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "tourist" structure: the protagonist goes to a place, consumes a magical item, and receives an epiphany without obstacle. Causality is soft; events happen sequentially because the script demands it, not because of character agency under pressure. The ending provides a realization but lacks earned closure as no price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending where the bridge reforms and the photographs are restored without a lasting price, negating the climax's consequences. The causality is driven by dream logic (magic breaks it, magic fixes it), failing to provide the requisite felt cost for strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    Closure relies on a severe causality break (the sudden, unexplained ability to snap chains) and a "deus ex machina" resolution where magical vines instantly neutralize the threat. There is no earned cost; the protagonist resolves the central conflict by throwing an object that works perfectly without sacrifice or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from an established goal to a failed attempt (vials) and a costly escalation (cutting the root). The drive lens (Causal/Process) holds firmly through to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist’s perception is permanently altered. The fable-like logic of "liquid memory" is established early and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot relies on weak causality and convenience; a "pressure-sensitive floor" is established but ignored, and the lock is bypassed by magical fiat ("starlight") rather than a logical application of the protagonist's skills. The ending provides a "win-win" resolution that dissolves tension without exacting a price, failing to satisfy the requirement for closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    Structure is functional and orientation is clear, but the climax relies on environmental convenience (the thaw revealing the compartment) rather than protagonist agency. The resolution provides a "win" without a visible cost or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality dissolves at the climax; reciting cryptic notes to a hitman causes his composure to crack without a logical basis, and the conflict is resolved via a "weeks later" summary rather than on-page action. The finding of a decades-old cast on a desk in a "crumbling" library strains credulity and feels like a convenient prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual progression—wait, draw, succeed—without significant causal complications or deviations. While the closure is legible as a completed task (the map is drawn, the star fades), the lack of meaningful obstacles or tactical shifts makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a magical object and a convenient exposition dump regarding the &quot;test&quot; rather than protagonist agency. The closure feels mechanical, with the scientist returning solely to deliver a thematic explanation that lowers the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where a cracked projector lens conveniently decodes paper doodles into text without grounding or setup. The "By dawn" transition glosses over the actual process of learning this new language, skipping the necessary struggle for a montage-like summary that weakens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies on a fable-like logic that clashes with the established sci-fi rules (measurable luck/sensors); the connection between polishing marbles and the maze’s behavior is asserted rather than causal. The inciting incident (Joren approaching) leads to a resolution with no significant obstacles, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc (setup, wobble, fix) without a decisive change or legible cost. The resolution restores the status quo immediately, lacking the "felt cost" or reconfiguration required for effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (vowing to finish the symphony) is legible. However, the climax relies on a "force majeure" (burst pipe) and instant competence (memorizing the code in seconds) to resolve the conflict, which bypasses the felt cost of losing the physical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is functional, but the pivotal discovery relies on a significant convenience: the antagonist leaving a "QUARANTINE" folder open and visible on a desk with the door ajar. This reduces the protagonist's agency in the investigation phase. Closure is clear (she leaves), but the path there feels structurally too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "video game cutscene" structure where an object (valve) triggers an expository monologue (hologram) that explains the entire backstory and theme. This "explain-everything" ending resolves the mystery through passive observation rather than protagonist agency or investigation, robbing the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes fetch quest structure where obstacles are overcome by simply proceeding to the next step. The closure relies on a "soft reset" anti-pattern: the magic water washes away the internal conflict ("judgment") and restores the character without a decisive, costly choice or sacrifice, reducing the ending to a convenient fix.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative arc hinges on a deus ex machina (the glowing curl) that resolves the central debate instantly, undercutting the causal chain. Closure is achieved mechanically through this supernatural event rather than an earned shift in perspective, leaving the resolution feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story follows a linear "find clue, solve puzzle" structure with a low-cost resolution; the climax relies on a convenient magic-system trigger (speaking to the wall) rather than a causally earned turn. While the "Concept Repricing" (axis of attention) is present, the lack of visible cost or difficulty in the final beat limits the impact. The closure lands, but it feels unearned by the preceding low pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure relies on a significant POV and physics violation; Elara observes minute details (a man reading text inside a lunch pail) from a lighthouse tower, which is physically impossible. This breaks the scene's visual logic to force a tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, but the causality relies on abstract "magic words" logic where rhetorical questions physically break machinery. The threat of possession is a plot device that never exerts concrete pressure on the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story operates well as a textural vignette under an Accumulative lens, but the closure ("it was enough") provides symmetric satisfaction without a felt cost or Decisive Change. The narrative progression is smooth but linear, lacking a distinct turn where the protagonist must adapt her tactics against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a linear, "and-then" sequence of observations rather than causal escalation. The closure—a convenient crumbling of the tablet and a sudden feeling of peace—lacks causal necessity and functions as a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure violates short-story density by dissolving into summary montage ("Days passed," "Seasons turned") halfway through. The central tension resolves too early with a "magic pill" fix, leaving the ending to rely on retrospective explication rather than a dramatized closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.4)
    Causality suffers from convenience; the "rogue zone" is visible from Elias's roof, yet he—a meticulous storm mapper—was unaware of it until the pigeon arrived. The infiltration and exfiltration are frictionless, lacking the necessary complications to earn the resolution. Closure is present (Decisive Change) but feels performed rather than inevitable, as the burning of the message contradicts the goal of exposing the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure relies on a deus ex machina (the ultraviolet vision) to deliver all necessary exposition for the resolution. Closure is tidy and explanatory ("She understood now"), offering a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains insight without paying a visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative pivots on a clear causal choice (cut vs. untie) that enacts the closure. However, the ending relies on the entity explaining the meaning ("The texture of time is...") rather than letting the resonant image of the thread land the realization alone.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is clear but strictly linear, following an "intention-action-success" path that lacks causal complexity or setbacks. The closure is a "happy ending" resolution where the problem dissolves instantly, missing the required felt cost or sacrifice to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "transaction" template: client asks, merchant provides, client leaves satisfied. There is no complication, refusal, or meaningful obstacle to test the protagonist's method. The ending creates "symmetric satisfaction" (a soft reset) rather than a Decisive Change with felt cost; the stated price of "losing joy" is accepted too easily to register as narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot relies on a major broken promise: the "own handwriting" hook implies a surreal or psychological mystery that is dropped completely in favor of a coincidental meeting. The narrative dissolves into summary ("Months later") rather than delivering a dramatized closure unit, and the coincidence of the girl being nearby undermines causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot follows a linear "fetch quest" structure with minimal complication; the move from desire to resolution relies heavily on summary ("spent days tracing"). The closure—a revelation that the search was a "test"—feels convenient and lowers the narrative stakes, resolving the central conflict without requiring a decisive, costly change from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and integrates the prompt's magic system logically, but the climax dissolves into a summary montage ("saw herself as a child...") rather than a dramatized confrontation. The ending provides Conceptual Repricing (monster to guardian) but lacks a felt cost, making the resolution feel safe.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from ritual to vision to epiphany with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure. The causality holds, though the "riddle" feels solved by thematic realization rather than a concrete deductive or sacrificial step.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is driven by extreme convenience rather than causality; the "sense memory" acts as a magical GPS, and finding a functional "Project Lumen—Decoder" right where the pipe leads is a deus ex machina that erases tension. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction where the protagonist finds exactly what she needs without paying a price, rendering the ending unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on "magical botany" (a hellebore instantly retracting and splitting, vines growing overnight) that breaks the established realistic tone. The resolution is a low-cost realization that feels unearned because the environment bends unrealistically to prove the protagonist right.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on a "magic fix" closure where an external object resolves the central problem without a causal price paid by the protagonist. The ending feels unearned, as the stranger explains the theme and provides the solution, removing the need for the character to navigate the crisis herself.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line from arrival to destruction, meeting the criteria for a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The cost is unmistakably paid on the page (the cave shattering). The inciting incident and climax are structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary rather than dramatized scenes, spanning weeks in a way that dissipates tension. The resolution is driven by extreme coincidence—strangers appearing with the exact missing items just because she waits—and the "perfect fix" ending lacks the required cost or closure validation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure: follow arrows, use key, receive reward. While the causality is clear under a dream-logic lens, the closure relies on a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; moment where a projection explains the theme rather than a decisive change driven by the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a magic object to resolve the protagonist's internal ennui without agency or cost; the resolution is a gift rather than an earned change. The plot progression is linear, lacking a causal turn that forces a difficult trade-off or material loss.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the storm's disruption to the escape. The closure is decisive and adheres to the logic established early on. However, the "spatial mutiny" is name-dropped as an explanation rather than utilized as a mechanical constraint that forces ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story suffers from a severe "summary resolution" failure; the climactic negotiation is elided entirely ("For the next hour... She traded"), bypassing the necessary dramatization of cost. Additionally, the shift from "just chemistry" to literal telepathy breaks the established reality to solve the plot convenience, acting as a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story functions as a vignette with no causal spine; events occur sequentially (setup, hum, writing, sunrise) without forcing a decisive change. The ending collapses into an unearned summary of future reputation ("townsfolk... regarded her with awe") rather than landing a specific closure unit with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is driven by extreme coincidence rather than agency; the protagonist overhears the exact necessary exposition from passing strangers and stumbles upon a skeleton with his own photo during a storm. The narrative logic fractures at the climax: finding a skeleton with his name and photo implies he is dead or replaced, but the story treats this merely as proof of a "clerical error" conspiracy. The ending resolves a question the protagonist already knew the answer to in line one.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot follows a path of least resistance: Lira tries the solution once, and it works perfectly without complication or cost. The resolution relies on a convenient object (the glowing note) appearing to confirm success, bypassing genuine causal problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Over the next week") that dissipates tension and violates the short-story scope. The resolution is unearned; the antagonist withdraws due to a sentimental speech without exacting a price, failing the requirement for closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure relies on a "years later" epilogue to validate the protagonist's action, which undercuts the tension and resonance of the primary scene. The closure feels unearned within the timeline of the main action, depending instead on a future archivist to explain the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot is a linear problem-solution sequence with no meaningful deviation; the climax relies on a mentor's advice to solve the puzzle, removing agency from the protagonist. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the job is done and status quo is restored without any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is undermined by the phrasebook, which functions as a convenient oracle (flipping automatically to relevant diagrams) without established rules. The "Years later" epilogue dissipates the immediate tension of the discovery, creating a summary ending rather than a dramatized closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Days passed") to bridge the gap between the initial action and the climax, dissipating scene pressure and bypassing the concrete details of the restoration process in favor of a fable-like gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible inciting incident and climax. Closure lands with a clear conceptual shift (capture vs. release), though the resolution relies heavily on a "magic key" mechanic (vial on pedestal) that simplifies the causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is replaced by dream logic where physical constraints (walls, gravity) dissolve without established rules or cost. The resolution relies on a "magic" deus ex machina (the lattice as a pen) that bypasses rather than solves the labyrinth's threat. The ending ("found himself") is a summary statement that asserts closure instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is structurally unbalanced, front-loaded with five paragraphs of backstory summary before the active scene begins. The resolution relies on a "magic button" interaction (bead touches fruit) that resolves the conflict instantly without causal pressure or earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist faces no significant setbacks. The resolution relies on a "magic fix" (sewing the plates) that works instantly, lacking a Decisive Change with felt cost. The encounter with the sleepwalker is atmospheric but causally inert.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The use of a montage ("Days passed") in the middle of a short piece dissipates narrative tension and reduces the central action of rebuilding to a summary. While the causality is logical, the scope violation of summarizing the primary struggle robs the climax of earned weight. The closure lands on a success that feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure relies on a linear "scavenger hunt" mechanic where the clipboard solves the puzzles (translating chalk, analyzing light) for the protagonist. Causality is weak because obstacles are removed by technology rather than character ingenuity or sacrifice. While the ending offers a decision, it arrives via a video exposition dump rather than an earned resolution of the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.3)
    The climax relies on an unestablished magical interaction (candle changing embroidery) that feels disconnected from the story's established physical rules. The ending is a low-stakes demonstration that explains the premise without exacting a visible cost or forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with low causality; the resolution is granted by the setting rather than earned through a decisive action or sacrifice. The closure ("healing") feels unearned because no visible price is paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on fable logic where complex geopolitical conflict yields to a single poetic metaphor, lacking credible causality. The resolution—a hardened general swayed instantly by a piece of coral—bypasses necessary narrative pressure and feels like an unearned "magic feather" solution.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "idea leads to immediate success" trajectory lacking causal complications or setbacks. The "knowledge network" appears as a convenient device to deliver exposition exactly when needed, smoothing over potential investigative friction. Closure is tidy and thematic but lacks a "felt cost" because the protagonist never risks failure or sacrifices anything significant to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a mentor's explanation of "nested awakenings" rather than the protagonist's active struggle or ingenuity in the moment. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (accepting the rhythm of awakening), but it lands softly without a visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (arrive, pass test, get seed, win) with no significant obstacles or reversals. The "test" with the pheromones is solved instantly, draining tension from the inciting incident. Closure is a "mission accomplished" moment that lacks the required visible or felt cost; the victory feels unearned because nothing was truly risked.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative spans centuries in summary, violating the short-story scope and dissipating tension into a fable-like recounting. The resolution relies on a *deus ex machina* (the postcard magically transforming into a healing seed) that removes the central problem (insomnia) without a felt cost or earned causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the flaw becomes a feature. However, the solution (singing a magical lullaby) bypasses the physical setup, softening the causal grit.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.0)
    The causal chain in the translation scene relies on "magical" logical leaps (river -> mill -> mead -> wedding) that lack genuine grounded causality. Closure is achieved, but the resolution with the sister is abrupt and lacks resistance or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central mechanism defies basic physical logic: a surveyor’s chain (heavy brass links, approx. 8 inches long) cannot plausibly measure the microscopic fractures of envelope adhesive. The narrative relies on this "technobabble" solution without establishing ground rules, leading to a frictionless resolution with no cost or sacrifice paid for the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure collapses in the middle, breaking the single-scene/two-shard requirement for this length by dissolving into a vague montage ("Weeks passed"). Causality breaks when the central mystery is resolved by a literal dream and the "absurd" mapping of dust motes, a Deus Ex Machina that bypasses logical investigation. The orientation is stable, but the drive lens fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves closure through Lira’s decision to leave the "sacred threshold," effectively a Conceptual Repricing of her relationship with her father. However, the causality is soft; the mechanism of resolution—writing a code to materialize a door—relies on convenient dream logic without established constraints, weakening the sense of earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence of anticipation and fulfillment without causal tightening or obstacles; the skepticism of the researchers evaporates instantly, removing narrative tension. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" where the event occurs exactly as hoped, lacking the required cost or risk to validate the ending. The drive lens is weak, as events happen to the protagonist rather than being driven by her.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a convenient device—the "pool of liquid light"—to deliver the climax via expositional imagery rather than active problem-solving. While the drive is causal (clue → hypothesis → test), the resolution arrives through a magical display that explains the mystery rather than the protagonist earning the answer through a high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot relies on unearned coincidence (the fountain lighting up "as if on cue") rather than causal agency, making the climax feel magical rather than earned. The closure is a "Symmetric Satisfaction" ending where the protagonist succeeds completely without trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving cleanly from preparation to ritual to result with a legible closure (restoration). The pacing is steady, though the conflict resolution—a successful magic ritual—lacks significant complication or unexpected cost beyond standard "pain." The orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story is a linear vignette with no causal drive or meaningful complication; events unfold sequentially without consequence. Closure is weak, relying on a summary notebook entry rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that alters the character's status or options.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (climb, open, realize) but relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the hourglass animates and speaks, resolving deep trauma without cost. The ending explains everything away ("fragments of a larger truth") and grants an unearned emotional reset. The "epiphany" is asserted rather than dramatized through causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a successful experiment, lacking a decisive change or complication that forces adaptation. Closure is weak, offering a "to be continued" sentiment ("Tomorrow, she’d launch another") rather than a resonant reconfiguration or a paid cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exploration to discovery and a decisive closure act. The causal link between burning the negative and the ivy parting relies on dream logic that borders on convenience, though it fits the atmospheric drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a linear path of intent-to-success (Symmetric Satisfaction) without a meaningful twist or complication to challenge the protagonist's method. The resolution is earned only by increased physical effort, lacking the "felt cost" or conceptual repricing required for higher-tier closure; the ending feels too neat given the metaphysical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.7)
    The central turning point—the shift from hostility to "weary resignation"—occurs off-page or via summary during the midday lull ("When the talks resumed, the atmosphere had shifted"). This soft reset dissolves the conflict without a dramatized cause or earned lever, robbing the climax of narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting drive (the ritual) and effective closure (Earned Stasis). The transition from the salt flat back to the mansion provides a necessary cadence shift. The logic of the "map drawn by cracks" is slightly abstract for the grounded tone, but the closure lands with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and functional but lacks a true tightening of stakes; the obstacle (the threads) yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempt. Closure is achieved, but the absence of a visible price or complication makes the victory feel unearned and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the reversed projection and campfire epiphany) lands a Conceptual Repricing. However, the sequence lacks causal friction; the performance succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt or failure that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks causal tightening; the resolution relies on the coincidental arrival and compliance of the butterfly rather than the protagonist's agency forcing a result. The closure offers a "Resonant Reconfiguration" but feels unearned because the protagonist faces no meaningful obstacle or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a strict procedural line (task → exertion → success) without a decisive turn or complication. The closure, while complete, feels like a "win state" achieved through effort rather than a narrative reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story follows a linear path to a "soft reset" ending where the protagonist wakes up refreshed with a new outlook but no visible cost. The climax relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where a holographic figure explicitly verbally resolves the central mystery ("The directive is not a command, but a question").

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, video-game logic (insert tile, receive exposition, unlock door) that limits causal agency. While the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, it feels unearned because the resolution is delivered by a magical entity rather than the protagonist's ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" device (the liquid) to resolve conflict instantly, bypassing causal struggle or cost. The middle montage dissipates tension, and the climax replicates the opening beat's solution without meaningful escalation or a divergence in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the central problem (fixing the sextant) encounters no obstacles or setbacks. Causality is soft, relying on convenient magical assertions ("viscous liquid," "breathe as one") rather than earned mechanical or emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is linear and low-tension, relying on a "fix-it" beat where magic tools ("liquid starlight") resolve the conflict without established constraints or costs. The climax—trees bursting into bloom—feels like a magical reward for thematic compliance rather than a causal result of the protagonist's struggle. Closure is neat but unearned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (letter → shell → vision → fusion) that relies on dream logic rather than causal agency. The central puzzle is resolved by a disembodied voice ("You inherit what you choose to see") acting as a deus ex machina, rather than the protagonist solving it through wit or sacrifice. Closure lands via a magical transaction, effective but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the resolution of the "Silence" shelf relies on a convenient memory (the childhood tune) introduced at the moment of need, weakening the causal chain. The leap from the "renegotiate" note to the final strategy is functional but lacks a robust logical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on video-game logic (find journal, hum tune, open door) and unearned magical resolution ("memories flooded her") to bypass genuine causality. The ending provides closure but lacks a felt cost, relying on a *deus ex machina* disappearance of the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on convenience—Elara happens to pack the exact seal needed—and the mechanics of the solution ("reweaving threads" of a schematic design?) are physically illegible, breaking causality. Closure is a "soft reset" (she returns to the start state with no visible change in the world or herself), lacking the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory: problem introduced, ritual performed, success achieved. While the closure is legible as a restoration of balance, the plot lacks a decisive turn, complication, or error that forces the protagonist to adapt; the ritual works exactly as intended with no deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Days bled into nights") to skip necessary escalation, and the climax hinges on a convenient coincidence (moonlight) rather than causal agency. The ending creates a fatal logical contradiction: stars "blazed in the sky" in the climax, yet the denouement claims the "void in the sky remained" and Elara never saw them return.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is coherent, moving logically from observation to realization. However, the causal link between measuring shadows and the epiphany of "participating" is weak, relying on abstract internal monologue rather than narrative pressure or external stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist succeeds at every turn without setback or cost. The "turn" relies on the convenience of a note found exactly when needed, and causality is weakened by the lack of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where a single metaphorical statement solves a deep-seated interpersonal conflict. There is no legible cost to the closure; Elara risks nothing, and Kael's agreement feels unearned by the preceding action. The narrative acts as a vignette rather than a causal sequence of pressure and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the resolution relies on magical causality unsupported by the established world rules (a biological sprout appearing through concrete because a porcelain doll was lost). The connection is thematic, not causal, making the closure feel contrived rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence with no causal turns or external pressure. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset"—a change of mind—without the required visible or felt cost to anchor the realization. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the causal chain holds, but the progression feels mechanical and video-game-like. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "twist" of the mirror-throne is a familiar convention.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "soft reset" structure where the protagonist summons a solution (Kael) that resolves the problem immediately. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction—he simply agrees to return—stripping the ending of the required felt cost or irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution relies on a deus ex machina where the device explicitly commands the solution ("The bolt is a key. Turn it"), removing agency and trial-and-error. While the loss of the diamonds constitutes a plot cost, the lack of struggle or difficult trade-off for the protagonist makes the closure feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a "magic key" device where standing waves conveniently unlock a physical mechanism and provide expository visions. The climax (reading a letter) is low-energy and resolves the central mystery via explanation rather than dramatized discovery. The causality feels video-game-like, with the environment yielding instantly to the correct tool without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, though the changing text on the program acts as a convenient instructional guide rather than organic discovery. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the logic of the orb shattering leading to the wheat field relies heavily on dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central deduction breaks causality: relying on a dust ring on a folder spine or shelf to persist undisturbed from 1875 in an active file room strains suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point. The "door slam" introduces artificial tension that resolves immediately (a false beat) without escalating the plot. Closure is soft, lacking a decisive change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative moves linearly from infiltration to escape, but the climax relies on a convenient, unexplained explosion to resolve the pursuit. The "puddle map" is an inventive concept relegated to summary exposition rather than an active, on-page problem-solving beat. Closure is standard symmetric satisfaction without a felt cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist overcomes the antagonist using a "magic feather" capability (negative space) established only for that purpose. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (peace returns), but the victory feels unearned by sacrifice or tactical ingenuity, relying instead on dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure lacking causal friction; Elinor tries a complex magical ritual (learned conveniently years ago) and it works instantly without failure or adaptation. The ending provides a task list rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost is dismissed explicitly ("didn't mourn its loss"), robbing the closure of weight. The drive lens is nominally causal but lacks resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    The climax relies on a convenient accident (the ground giving way) to locate the object, robbing the protagonist of agency in solving the riddle. The timeline structure—jumping from cave to flashback to greenhouse and back—dissipates tension in such a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is functional and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, but the causality is low-friction; magic resolves the central mystery instantly upon dropping the coin. The protagonist acts once, then passively receives a lesson, lacking a sequence of escalating tests.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path without significant causal friction; Lira arrives, answers a riddle, and receives her reward. The resolution relies on symbolic assertion—holding out the tooth solves the problem—rather than a mechanism that demands sacrifice or ingenuity. The lack of a felt cost or a difficult trade-off makes the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc relies on a "soft reset" closure; Elias goes from tormented to "mind clearer than it had been in years" too easily after a brief conversation. The resolution lacks a visible, felt cost, making the emotional healing feel unearned by the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with low causal tension; the protagonist encounters an obstacle and is immediately handed the solution (the ink) by a secondary character. The closure feels unearned because the resolution requires no ingenuity or cost from Lira, only compliance with instructions. The ending relies on a summary of the lesson learned rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient supernatural causality where finding a physical object instantly resolves spiritual entrapment without cost or complication. The climax is low-pressure, and the resolution (ghosts simply fading after being "seen") is a standard trope that lacks narrative weight or logical necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is coherent, but the inciting incident (a perfect spiral appearing exactly when needed) relies on convenient coincidence. The resolution creates a Decisive Change, but the transition from chaos to "architects" is rushed and lacks a felt cost, reading as a "win-win" transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.0)
    The resolution relies on convenient biological determinism (fungi growing with specific architectural symbols overnight) and a summary tail ("The dispute raged for weeks") that dissipates the scene's climax. The causal link between covering mirrors and the fungi blooming is weak; the former feels like a distraction rather than a structural necessity for the latter.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, with a clear inciting incident and resolution that fits the established magic system. However, the resolution relies on a "magic therapy" trope where admitting a truth instantly repairs a mechanical object, which feels convenient and lowers the narrative cost. The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there is linear and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, but the progression relies on linear exploration rather than causal complication. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the world as "unknowable"—lands, but the path there is paved with convenient discoveries (the compass, the initials) rather than earned turns that test the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest lacking causality or cost; Lira finds a key, uses it, and receives answers via a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; grandmother figure. The ending is an &quot;explain-everything&quot; resolution where understanding is bestowed without sacrifice, failing the requirement for felt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure fails the short-story scope test, relying on a year-long montage ("Days passed," "By summer") instead of a dramatized scene; the resolution hinges on a convenient expository inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    A significant causality break undermines the climax: the staircase is hidden beneath the lagoon and only revealed by the ghost, yet the antagonist is waiting inside ("I’ve been expecting you") without explanation of how he entered or bypassed the sealed threshold. Additionally, the trapdoor resolution relies on a convenient trigger mechanism that feels unearned despite the earlier vision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on montage ("Days passed, then weeks") rather than scene-level causality, preventing the formation of a cohesive dramatic unit. The resolution is achieved through a magical awakening that lacks a legible cost or mechanical logic; the bottle functions as a convenient fix rather than a tool requiring sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal link between the foghorn’s silence and the specific phonograph shaving is weak; noticing the frequency pattern "just now" relies on convenient coincidence. The narrative arc is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or testing, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist without genuine causality or obstruction; the protagonist performs a ritual that succeeds instantly without testing her resolve. The central mechanism—decreasing entropy by introducing disorder—is conceptually incoherent (disorder increases entropy), creating a logical break that the story attempts to wave away as "paradox" without earning the suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central mechanic—changing a rope alters the bell's pitch—lacks physical plausibility, breaking causal immersion. The resolution relies on a Deus ex machina (Veyra) who explains the solution, and the closure is a low-cost reset of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot is a linear errand lacking causal pressure or a decisive turning point; the climax relies on a convenient, magical souvenir (stardust) rather than an earned result of the protagonist's actions. The ending asserts a resolution without a visible or felt cost to the character. Closure is weakened by the lack of prior constraint or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.6)
    The resolution is a classic *deus ex machina* where the box literally spells out the solution ("Speak") and the protagonist obeys, resolving the conflict instantly. The ending fails the closure cost requirement; the problem vanishes, Elias feels "light," and the only price is the aesthetic loss of the box.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on dream logic rather than causality; the resolution ("Instantly, the mercury stilled") is an unearned convenience that bypasses mechanical or character-driven problem solving. The prompt's required method (garage sale descriptions) is cited as a plan but disconnected from the actual scene mechanics, creating a logical gap in how the silo is fixed.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of low resistance: a minor disruption (snapped string) is immediately and successfully resolved by magic without complication. The closure relies on a philosophical summary ("beauty was not a fixed state") rather than a dramatized reconfiguration of stakes or incurred cost. The ending explains the meaning of the events rather than letting the imagery carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story builds a clear causal chain, but the ending dissolves into summary ("Days later," "On her final morning"), which distances the reader from the immediate cost of the climax. The "ground shaking" introduces a physical threat that vanishes without altering tactics, creating a false peak. Closure is weakened by the epilogue, which explains the outcome rather than letting the resonant moment with the spirit stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is a linear tour that relies on a "guide explains the plot" mechanic at the climax. The closure—a chemically/magically induced feeling of longing—lacks a causal link to the protagonist's agency or specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot is linear and low-tension, lacking a decisive tightening or reversal; obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient bird calls. A causality error undermines the stakes: the jetty is described as "blooming" with "flowers defying the gloom" in the opening, yet the soil is later called "barren," confusing the necessity of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a repetitive loop of riddle-sniff-solve without escalating difficulty or causal setbacks. The resolution ("Love") functions as a "soft reset" and "explain-everything ending," resolving the settlement's despair without any visible or felt cost to the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis to a clear "Conceptual Repricing" closure where Elio redefines his confusion as freedom. The "glimpse" serves as a convenient inciting incident, but the structural integrity holds through the final choice to leave the deck.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line with valid closure (Decisive Change: sky clears). However, the solution is pre-manufactured (replicas crafted months ago), removing the need for on-page problem solving or adaptation. The plot functions mechanically but lacks a pivotal moment of discovery or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing (pawns = the people) with a physical change (board reconfigured). However, the mechanics are video-game-like (spell word, reverse word) and the "Interregnum" functions largely as a convenience to remove external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is complete and causal, moving from inciting desire to resolution. However, the climax relies on an explanatory vision (the mother explaining the rules) and a convenient manifestation of new powers (turning rocks to feathers) to resolve the physical threat, which lowers the sense of earned structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where interacting with a magical object fixes both the external curse and the internal wound without visible cost. The causality follows dream logic rather than character agency, and the "explain-everything" ending deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution relies on a "magic feather" mechanic where a poem instantly dismantles deep-seated social dogma without causal friction. The "price of forgiveness" is stated in exposition but not paid on the page, leaving the closure unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    The resolution relies on a "pathetic fallacy" where the external threat (the acid sea) magically stills because the protagonist has an internal realization, breaking the story's established physical rules. The "soft reset" ending dissolves the stakes without a logical causal link between the charm and the environment. While the cost (burning lungs) is present, the mechanism of safety is unconvincing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist overcomes the stated danger ("twisting like a labyrinth") effortlessly via "humming intuition." Closure is a "soft reset" where external magic (the vision in the pool) resolves internal distress without a visible cost or decisive change in stance. The inciting incident drives action, but the climax lacks earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a "soft reset" where the antagonist (Thalos) immediately validates the protagonist, deflating tension without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the magic simply works as intended—rather than a decisive change earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear instruction-execution loop ("do this" -> she does it) without complication or failure. The closure arrives as a neat completion of a checklist, lacking a sense of earned causality or protagonist agency navigating genuine obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (deciding to weaponize truth) is decisive. However, the central mechanic—using truth to "occlude"—feels logically slippery and relies on semantic wordplay rather than a tightly causal mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution ("I'll return them") that lacks an established causal mechanism or visible cost on the page. The logic of the backstory—the captain taking a mother's memory of her daughter to assuage his own guilt over a ship—is contradictory and confusing. The ending assumes a capability Elias has not been shown to possess in a dramatized way.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest with minimal resistance; the discovery of the cave and chip faces no significant obstacles. The closure lacks a felt cost; Lila steps into the vision and returns without sacrificing anything (the chip remains a "comfort"), resulting in a "soft reset" that dissolves the problem without a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is functional but relies on an "explain-everything" encounter to resolve the plot. The inciting incident (dreams) leads linearly to the climax, but the climax lacks causal friction; the antagonist simply hands the protagonist the answer. Closure lands on an internal shift ("understood"), but without a visible cost or behavioral change on the page, it feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal arc, but the closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem resolves perfectly without visible cost. The resolution acts as a "magic key" moment—the ledger provides the answer instantly—bypassing the need for a genuine struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (grave, cabin, scroll, ledge) that relies on convenient prompts rather than organic causality. The ambiguity of the protagonist's state (dreaming vs. dead) muddies the stakes rather than deepening the mystery. Closure is achieved through a conceptual summary that explains the theme rather than a dramatized shift.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality collapses with the "client file" containing a captioned personal photo from 1983; Mrs. Voss providing this contradicts her established reticence. Furthermore, the premise of a client bringing a medical birthing clamp screw to a water clock repair shop for "repair" is mechanically illogical and breaks suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, but the climax relies on a "soft reset" where the expected cost (pain) is replaced by "strange lightness." This undermines the causal weight of the magic system; the victory feels granted by the prompt's requirements rather than earned through a difficult tradeoff or ingenuity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a legible closure with the finished song and the chainsaws starting, effectively utilizing the "Resonant Reconfiguration" form. However, the central mechanism—using a perfume bottle as an electrical conduit for a ghost via piano vibrations—strains causal credibility, even for a fantasy piece. The logic jump from metaphor to literal mechanics is abrupt and weakens the narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a dream logic where events happen sequentially but lack causal pressure; obstacles dissolve upon contact (e.g., nodding at the mural). The ending provides a realization without an earned cost, acting as a soft reset rather than a consequence of struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is solid, utilizing the countdown ritual effectively to pace the escalation toward the climax. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the premise, though the causal link between the counting and the fjord opening operates on dream logic rather than established mechanics, slightly softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure lacks causal resistance; the barrier "chooses" the protagonist immediately, removing the obstacle. The climax relies on "magic wand" logic where adjusting a laser's frequency to "trust" instantly fixes a complex biological and quantum system. Closure is achieved, but the lack of difficulty renders the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative flow is smooth but lacks friction; the antagonist (Ms. Greer) folds immediately into a mentor role, removing tension. The closure—a circular return to the library—reads as a "soft reset," relying on a stated internal realization rather than a dramatized cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    The episodic structure lacks causal momentum, relying on a linear list of successful calls; the resolution is "symmetric satisfaction" where complex problems dissolve instantly upon contact (e.g., the baker’s immediate laughter). Closure is legible as Earned Stasis, but the low difficulty of the preceding beats robs the ending of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.9)
    The structure is a linear vignette leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure ("it was in the now"). While the realization lands, the lack of an active obstacle or visible cost makes the resolution feel like a philosophical conclusion rather than an earned narrative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path but stumbles at closure; the resolution is a "soft reset" where a supernatural entity explains the theme and fixes the protagonist's internal conflict without a price. Causality is driven by dream logic rather than character agency, leading to an unearned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on convenience (finding a platinum case in the river) rather than causal progression. The "constellation pause" sets a timer that is rendered irrelevant when the map takes over, dissolving the established tension without consequence. The ending is a "reward" resolution that lacks earned structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a didactic intervention rather than causal action to resolve the plot. The closure—a girl’s fever breaking offline because Elias decided to apologize—reads as "symmetric satisfaction" or a magical reward for correct moral thinking, lacking a concrete causal link on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but causality operates on "dream logic" rather than grounded interaction; Lira understands Kael’s intent instantly without struggle. The closure is a soft "Resonant Reconfiguration," but because the inciting challenge (disrupting silence) faced no obstacles, the resolution feels unearned and purely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.0)
    The mid-story time jump ("On the third day") breaks the continuous tension required for this short scope and dissipates the narrative drive. The resolution relies on a late-breaking magical effect (paint healing acid) that lacks established causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers a fatal causality break due to the mid-story POV fracture, which disrupts the frame. Closure is a "soft reset," resolving deep trauma with a single shared activity (drumming) without establishing a credible price or logical process for the cure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina—finding the key hanging conveniently on a container—to bypass the labyrinth's navigational challenge. Closure lands on a thematic assertion without a legible cost paid by the protagonist; the success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story operates as a vignette with no decisive change or felt cost; Lira performs a routine, encounters a minor obstacle (the fisherman), and leaves exactly as she arrived. The ending relies on "Earned Stasis" without the earning—there is no risk taken or price paid. The narrative arc is flat, lacking an inciting incident or meaningful escalation to drive a structural shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a massive summary ("By dawn, Clara and Lila had played seven games") to bypass the critical relationship-building scene, dissolving tension rather than escalating it. The inciting incident relies on the coincidence of Lila finding the specific hidden grotto. Closure lands on a conceptual note, but the lack of on-page struggle weakens the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where magic resolves the central conflict without requiring a difficult tactical choice. The ending is a "soft reset" that dissolves the problem (the island and the trauma) via external agency (the whale) rather than protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates under an accumulative lens, focusing on the ritual of carving, but lacks a decisive turning point or escalation of pressure. The closure—a resolve to continue—feels like a restatement of the opening stance rather than a reconfiguration earned through the scene's friction. The narrative feels more like a static tableau than a progression.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear enactment of will (she speaks, the world obeys) rather than a causal chain of pressure and response. While the closure offers a Decisive Change in state, the lack of an obstacle or visible cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands with a tangible exchange (reed for dust), but the narrative arc relies on a mid-story magical gift (cobalt dust) to conveniently solve the protagonist's primary physical limitation and reveal the backstory. This reduces causal density, as the revelation comes from an external aid rather than active investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (receive task, go to location, find answer, return) with soft causality driven by dream logic rather than necessary consequence. Closure arrives via an explicit realization without a legible cost; the pilgrimage succeeds because the plot requires it, not because obstacles forced a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Structure is competent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but the climax (lighting the lantern) transitions too smoothly into a resolved epiphany without immediate scene-level obstacles. The ending relies on a magical realism summary ("Travelers spoke of...") that distances the reader from the cost of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear scene structure with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure (Mara's shift from despair to recruitment). However, the causality is purely metaphorical; the mechanism of "measuring tape equals cultural analysis" is asserted rather than dramatized through logical cause-and-effect, relying heavily on the reader accepting the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with soft causality; the protagonist succeeds immediately upon touching the artifact, bypassing the promised danger of "corruption." The closure relies on a "soft reset" where the antagonist simply disappears and the protagonist gains her desire without complication or sacrifice, diminishing the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.3)
    The resolution relies on a convenient, late-breaking explanation of the magic system (sharing time) and a password ("Bloom") that instantly fixes the problem. The ending is a "soft reset" that resolves the tension without earned causality or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is static; the "action" consists of a single task (glueing) that proceeds without interruption or complication. While the ending attempts a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of a present-tense causal turn or obstacle makes the resolution feel like a predetermined meditation rather than a story. The cost is purely retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear dream logic ("coffee rings" becoming portals) that functions but feels arbitrary. The closure acts as a Deus Ex Machina; the hourglass shatters and reveals a positive future, removing the weight of the problem without requiring the protagonist to pay a price or navigate a genuine dilemma. It resolves the plot but deflates the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: arrival, vision, explanation, and acceptance. The closure relies on an "explain-everything" flashback that resolves the mystery without requiring the protagonist to pay a price or navigate conflicting desires. The ending feels tidy and soft, lacking a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear fulfillment fantasy lacking a Causal or Situational drive lens that involves cost. The ending is a "gift" resolution where the protagonist succeeds immediately upon trying, with no setbacks or price paid for the magic. The plot relies on convenient guidance ("You're close," said a voice) rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear Causal arc, but the climax relies on dream logic that breaks mechanical causality: Kael "thinks of freight" and instantly achieves a god-like quantum superposition. While the closure (Decisive Change) is legible, the lack of friction or failure in the middle beats weakens the narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" ending where a hologram explicitly decodes the plot and theme for the reader. The climax lacks agency; the resolution happens *to* the character via magical animation rather than through a costly, active decision.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path without significant causal complications or setbacks. While the closure (leaving the punch) is a valid Conceptual Repricing that signals a shift in duty, the journey leading to it feels episodic and low-stakes. The "test" of the ridgeway is resolved instantly by walking, lacking a sense of earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers a severe causality break at the turning point; the connection between a tonic stain and a complex philosophical realization about social contracts is non-existent, reading as a "knowledge leap not earned by the scene." The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where a single speech fixes the "unpardonable silence" without meaningful cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is strictly linear and lacks resistance; obstacles like the missing map piece are solved instantly by convenient notes. A significant continuity error occurs with the prop: the singular ink pellet is pressed into a floor recess to open a door, then immediately hurled at the antagonist without retrieval. The ending is a "total victory" with no visible cost or trade-off, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a massive credibility break when bioluminescent plankton literally spell out coordinates, shattering the established reality. The transition from scientific inquiry to metaphysical journey is rushed ("Three days later"), and the resolution feels like an escape rather than a consequence of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.4)
    The resolution relies on a deus ex machina (magical alignment) that solves the central conflict without protagonist sacrifice or ingenuity. Causality is weak; the rebellion reignites because the stars aligned, not because of Lira's agency or a paid cost. The ending lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is driven by the plants providing step-by-step instructions, removing agency; the resolution (planting a biological embryo in boiling sulfurous water) relies on a sudden genre shift to magical logic that breaks the established physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is functional, moving from a trigger to a resolution, but the turning point relies on external guidance (Mrs. Voss) rather than protagonist agency. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, but the "months of therapy" summary does significant off-page heavy lifting, weakening the causal chain within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a Situational lens where environmental pressure ("walls closing in") forces a symbolic response. Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands, but the spatial logic of "descending" into darkness to reach the "top" of the lighthouse creates a disorientation bump. The cost of the resolution is abstract/metaphysical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    The mechanism of reading a digital drone’s memory via wind-blown ink on sand breaks causal plausibility and genre consistency without sufficient setup. The ending is a mere threshold crossing (cliffhanger) that fails to deliver the required decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot is linear and lacks meaningful resistance; the protagonist forms an intention and executes it without complication or on-page opposition. The transition "Within the blink that follows surprise" forces an unrealistic instant thaw that breaks the causal logic of the established technology for the sake of a prompt phrase. Closure is earned cheaply with a "revolution begins" summary rather than a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story functions as a static vignette rather than a causal narrative; the ending ("revolution") is a thematic leap unsupported by the low-stakes action of the scene. There is no orientation debt, but the drive lens is weak, relying on reflection rather than accumulation or causality to reach closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct beginning, middle, and end, and the closure lands with a definite change in the world state. However, the resolution relies heavily on the established techno-magic of the rail spike rather than a difficult, character-defining choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure fractures into summary ("Days later," "One evening") which dissipates the tension of the scene. The "proof by contradiction" setup promises a logical investigation but delivers a convenient discovery of a confession note, bypassing the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality breaks at the midpoint; the explanation "Via handwritten letters found in antique furniture" treats a physical prompt phrase as a software patch without established logic. Closure is frictionless; the antagonist cooperates instantly ("Welcome"), and the resolution acts as a "fix-it" button with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on convenience plotting and magical intuition; Mara solves the puzzle via sudden realization ("patterns were a map") rather than trial and error. The transition from chalk drawing to holographic projection lacks causal grounding, and the closure brings no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a vignette with a linear sequence of events but weak causality; the connection between placing a tile and the sky "healing" relies on unearned pathetic fallacy. The ending lacks a "Decisive Change" with visible cost—the resolution is symbolic and atmospheric rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a low-cost magical resolution where humming and dancing simply fix a "fractured timeline" without causal struggle. The climax lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the fading at the end is a genre convention, not a sacrifice earned by the scene's specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative dissipates immediate tension by jumping "Over the next week" to a summary montage, replacing a decisive scene-based struggle with reported success. The conflict with Mara dissolves rather than escalating, and the resolution (it simply works) lacks a visible cost paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery sequence lacking causal friction; the mechanism of the climax (algae + fossil = floating vision) feels arbitrary, and the resolution relies on a convenient epiphany rather than a hard-won structural shift.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central causal link—sorting buttons to unlock a magical jar—relies on dream logic that is not established by the world rules, feeling convenient rather than earned. The ending lacks closure cost; she simply succeeds and leaves, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that fails to reconfigure the narrative deeper than the premise level.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative drive is linear, and the central mechanism (transmitting data via temporary ink in soil) lacks verisimilitude, breaking the causal logic of the thriller frame. The ending reads as a prologue ("the real journey... had only just begun") rather than a complete arc with a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or a decisive closure event; the ending is a soft landing that reaffirms the status quo without cost. Orientation fails significantly regarding the "rain gutters": the rules for the ferry's arrival (appear when ticking stops) contradict the scene's timeline (gutters haven't started yet, then begin ticking at the end).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal loop—Mara discovering that her own past actions anchored the timeline—provides satisfying structural closure (Conceptual Repricing). The orientation is clear, and the fable-logic holds together well. The resolution relies slightly on the convenience of the lantern glass working instantly, but the narrative coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal pressure; the resolution (Mara opening the window) is a "soft reset" achieved through a sentimental gesture without earned cost or risk. The causality relies on dream logic—using a locksmith tool to "measure light"—which disconnects the physical reality of the object from its narrative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on external drivers (the hum, the sundial) to dictate the protagonist's actions and solve the central conflict. The climax yields a solution (the spiral, the tools) without extracting a visible price or forcing a trade-off, resulting in a low-agency resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the orientation is clear, moving logically from arrival to ritual. However, the structure relies heavily on a "tour guide" mechanic where Elara explains the plot and theme, removing the need for the protagonist to discover causality herself.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "Plan A works" structure where the solution (subsonic frequencies) meets no resistance, resulting in immediate surrender by the antagonist. The "Weeks later" temporal jump disrupts the short-story container, appending a sequel-hook coda instead of integrating the consequence into the main scene's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative arc is functional but mechanical; the resolution (stabbing the wall to stop the shifting) lacks established causal logic, reading as a convenient tool-fix rather than an earned turn. The closure is a standard threshold crossing without significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a suspension of disbelief that breaks the story's reality: finding a handprint in dirt/stone years after the fact in an open quarry is physically implausible. The discovery of the locket immediately afterward is a convenient coincidence that resolves the conflict without generating earned pressure. The causal chain is driven by authorial ease rather than character agency or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The timeline suffers from a severe credibility gap: Clara spends "hours" decoding and digging while an atmospheric crisis escalates and the director merely paces. The convenient discovery of a paper journal buried in gravel for decades strains plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on unearned epiphanies ("he realized it was a code") rather than causal logic to advance the plot. The resolution is a magical soft reset that dissolves the mystery without cost or struggle, breaking the drive lens and offering no meaningful closure beyond wish fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story violates the core requirement of dramatization; the central conflict (the startup's fall) occurs entirely in summary, leaving the present timeline as a low-stakes frame for reflection. There is no on-page causal chain or Decisive Change; the ending is merely a cessation of thought rather than a narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is functional, but the inciting incident and resolution rely heavily on a secondary character (Veyra) acting as a "tutorial" figure who explains the rules and hands over the solution. The climax—entering the hologram—is a choice, but it lacks causal complexity since the mechanism is provided rather than earned by the protagonist’s expertise. Closure lands with a resonant image, but the path there is linear and low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution: the revelation that the murder was actually self-defense removes the moral weight rather than forcing the character to carry it. The climax is passive; Mira releases a seed, and the seed performs the decisive action, reducing her agency to zero at the pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the established cost (pain/wounds) vanishes immediately upon acceptance, undermining the stakes. The causal chain is driven by dream-logic and convenient magical mechanics rather than character agency or necessary consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible—entry, transaction, exit—but the causality is low-friction. The "cost" of the transaction (a burned card she wanted to discard anyway) feels light relative to the profound soul-healing she receives. The resolution relies on a "magical therapy" trope where the protagonist is fixed by a supernatural amenity rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative tension dissipates with the “next morning” time jump, resolving the central mystery via a low-effort Google search and phone call rather than scene action. The closure is a thematic statement rather than a dramatic event with visible cost, effectively explaining the resolution rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with negligible resistance; the protagonist succeeds simply by applying her skills without setback or cost. The "Days later" transition into summary dilutes the ending, and the resolution (understanding is a story) feels like an unearned conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story operates as a vignette/ritual rather than a causal narrative; the smelting solves the problem via "magic box" convenience. The ending loop with the child creates symmetric satisfaction (a soft reset) rather than a decisive change with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where placing an object triggers a global miracle without established mechanics or commensurate cost. The resolution feels unearned by the on-page effort, depending on a "magic fix" that dissolves complex real-world problems (radioactive fields, isolation) instantly. The cost—a pearl the protagonist had no deep attachment to—is insufficient for the scale of the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure works, but the causality relies on the high convenience of graffiti perfectly tailored to Mara's specific emotional needs, which strains verisimilitude. The closure (drawing the heart map) is a legible change in stance (Conceptual Repricing), but the path there feels frictionless as the environment provides all the answers.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: observe, graph, solve, acquire. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks the book and finds it—without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration involving visible, felt cost. The logic of the solution (light delays = circular truth) is asserted rather than earned through causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a legible Decisive Change (destroying the violin) that resolves the central question. The causality follows the established dream-logic magic system consistently, moving from investigation to divination to resolution. The ending provides clear closure with a visible cost (the loss of the violin/dream).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is lucid, but the climax resolves via a "soft reset" where a vial of liquid moonlight and a song instantly fix a catastrophic structural failure. This convenience undermines the established stakes and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot hinges on a convenient off-screen deus ex machina (the merchant feeling guilty and returning the hairpin), which robs the protagonist of a meaningful choice or cost. The resolution is a simple handover without obstacle, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that is earned in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves closure through the removal of the chime, fitting a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the client accepts the protagonist's reinterpretation immediately, lacking the resistance that creates narrative density.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Days passed, then weeks") that dissipates the tension of the opening scene, violating the short-story scope by blurring time. The climax—Lira suddenly understanding the pattern—feels like a convenient arrival rather than a causal result of the specific interaction on the platform. The revelation is delivered through dialogue rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot relies on a "realization ex machina" where external stimuli (the bird pattern) instantly unlock a solution that ancestors had apparently carved in plain sight. The resolution—walking slowly to "navigate without moving"—relies on a semantic shift rather than a causal victory, and the logic that previous generations failed to look at the ledge carvings strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where every attempt succeeds immediately without cost or complication. The resolution relies on a "macguffin" (liquid starlight) and a sentimental object (sketch) that solve the problem instantly. The premise of an incompetent mage is discarded to facilitate the plot, breaking causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path, but the central pivot relies on a convenient coincidence (key tag 13 fits room 13) explicitly acknowledged as such, which lowers tension. The transition from wading into the sea to a breathable, dry library lacks physical grounding, leaning heavily on dream logic without establishing the rules early.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    The climax relies on an unearned knowledge leap (identifying the tower and moon symbols) that lacks causal setup in the scene. The resolution proceeds via a magical "distillation protocol" rather than derived tactics, undercutting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the causal mechanism (prism + sunlight = audio amplification) feels arbitrary and lacks established logic. Closure is tidy and relies on a soft conceptual cost ("ache of knowing") that isn't visually or viscerally validated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the "dripping rates" mechanic provides a solid causal thread. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration, but the climax ("Just as the last fish was caught") relies on coincidence rather than a definitive, high-cost choice by the protagonist, softening the agency at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.0)
    The arrival of the daughter functions as a convenient device to deliver necessary backstory and thematic instruction, undermining causal tension. While the transition from the label to the churchyard is smooth, the "dam is failing" urgency is introduced late in dialogue and resolved symbolically, creating a disconnect between the physical threat and the narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure is distinct (formula written), but the causality is mechanical. The connection between burning the hand and seeing the pattern relies on magical convenience ("pain sharpened her focus") rather than logical progression. The ending is too tidy ("The equation was perfect"), lacking the messy resonance of high-end literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative loop is standard: problem, attempt, memory-assist, solution. The causal mechanism—using a physical parachute buckle to input binary code into a mossy tree node via muscle memory—strains plausibility under a Causal lens. Closure is achieved as a "job well done," but it lacks a felt price or meaningful reconfiguration of the character's status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear battle structure that resolves via a "willpower" power-up rather than causal ingenuity. Closure is achieved, but the protagonist emerges "unbroken," negating the stated threat ("destroy us both") and failing to exact the required visible cost for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Hybrid lens (Mystery shifting to Surreal), and the orientation is stable. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Elias accepts "flow" over "forcing"—lacks a tangible cost; the resolution (finding the magic key) arrives as a gift rather than a consequence of sacrifice or ingenuity. The causality breaks (rapid growth, transformation into key) fit the surreal tone but lower the sense of earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a repetitive linear structure (exertion leads directly to success) without a meaningful deepening or pivot in tactics. The closure relies on a *Deus Ex Machina* "burst of light" that resolves the conflict by magic rather than earned causality, dissolving tension without a felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the physical mechanics of the climax are muddy; the cultist "clawing at the water as if drowning" in a fountain described earlier as "ice-crusted soil" creates spatial confusion. The transition from the garden to the library relies on the abstract "interiorizing" concept rather than concrete cause-and-effect, weakening the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot relies on a "Deus Ex Machina" moment where the solution ("Vivify") arrives unbidden from a dream, bypassing causal deduction. The repetition of the phrase "The penny dropped" to mark two separate realizations creates a structural stutter that weakens the narrative arc. Closure is present and legible, but the path to it feels mechanically assembled rather than organically escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "success" closure, but the resolution relies on dream logic where symbolic actions (smashing wires) yield massive physical results without sufficient causal grounding. The ending resolves the tension too neatly, lacking a felt cost or a complication that would add weight to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves legible closure (the ferry dissolves; Kael remains), effectively adhering to the "grotto/ferry" logic. However, the resolution relies on a "magic wand" sequence (radio + hourglass + patterns) that feels mechanically asserted rather than causally earned by the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic structure where events happen "without warning" (the thread erupting, the door materializing) rather than through causal progression. Closure is achieved through a deus ex machina realization rather than an earned price or consequence. The ending is tidy and lacks a felt cost, resolving the tension with a simple shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a logical vignette structure, but the closure—a realization that she is "learning to navigate... herself"—arrives via low-stakes reflection rather than a decisive change or paid cost. The "inciting incident" and "climax" are pedagogical beats rather than dramatic turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure resolved by the convenient discovery of the matching hearing aid, bypassing genuine problem-solving. Closure is tidy and symmetric ("Thank you," "Mission accomplished"), lacking the required Decisive Change or felt cost to qualify as literary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    Causality is undermined by hand-wave conveniences ("power, somehow, still flickered") and a "magic button" resolution where the gold instantly activates incompatible 1947 technology. The link between the "phase transition" theory and the physical solution is semantic rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive, forcing a stance crystallization against the AI's binary pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting the "mess"), though the mechanism of "defragmenting" via ink is purely symbolic, relying on magical realism logic within a tech setting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is achieved through a decisive act (discarding the diamond), but the climax relies on a late-breaking rule introduction ("the curse... was a mirror"). This explanation resolves the tension intellectually before the character resolves it physically, slightly weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from infiltration to confrontation and transformation. However, the resolution relies on the arrowhead acting as a convenient exit mechanism ("the world folded"), which softens the cost of the return; the "soft reset" to humanity happens too easily given the stakes of the metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    The plot relies on "soft magic" causality where the protagonist simply plays harder to resolve the conflict, bypassing tactical ingenuity or logic. The climax—a "geyser of light" that erupts to destroy the statues—functions as a *deus ex machina* rather than a consequence of the established mechanics (locust shell rhythms). The closure is legible, but the path to it lacks a decisive turning point or earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot relies on a "magic fix" resolution where a found object neatly resolves a complex geopolitical conflict. The closure feels unearned because the solution is external and convenient, lacking a causal chain driven by the protagonist's sacrifice or tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" sequencing without causal density or pressure. A major spatial logic break occurs when a standard train carriage contains a cobblestone courtyard and fountain; this "TARDIS" geometry is ungrounded and jarring. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply declares victory ("silence wasn't an end") without paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear progression without causal friction; the magic system is convenient, allowing a perfect resolution (reawakening the library) without demanding a sacrifice or complication. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the problem is solved cleanly, lacking the required cost for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality is driven by external magical coincidence (the light shifting, the dream speaking) rather than protagonist agency. The closure relies on a "soft reset" where the obstacle simply dissolves into a gift, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative moves linearly but lacks strong causal grounding; the climax (unlocking) leads to a "magical" scene shift rather than a logical consequence of the protagonist's specific actions. While the ending offers a conceptual shift (secrets as healing), the mechanism of "disorientation" feels convenient and unearned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" structure (Dream → Map → Locket → Explanation) without complication or reversal. The ending relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where a ghost explicitly resolves the mystery and theme in dialogue. Causality suffers from a dropped thread: the "price" warned of in the journal is never exacted, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is complete, but the resolution operates on dream logic that feels slightly mechanical. The causal link between the nervous habit and the magical solution is thematic rather than strictly causal, which weakens the closure's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear Causal arc: problem (fading), ritual (action), and restoration (result). Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change, though the "cost" (cutting a branch, losing a seed that is immediately replaced) feels low, and the convenience of the solution softens the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative resolves via a magical gift (the key appearing) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's actions; the ending explains the moral without exacting a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear puzzle-solving logic that lacks causality-driven twists or setbacks. While the closure offers a "Conceptual Repricing" (framing with questions, not borders), it arrives without a tangible price paid on the page, reading as a convenient victory.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality fractures under physical impossibilities; books and tape recorders cannot remain intact or functional after decades of submersion, nor does salt crust underwater. The leap from a 440 Hz hum to 1937 quantum encoding is a narrative convenience that shatters suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with no Causal or Accumulative pressure; Elias simply executes a list of tasks (draw for Lira, brother, self) without obstacle. The ending relies on Earned Stasis without cost—he leaves a flower and walks away unchanged. The repetition of the "Between lightning and thunder" frame acts as a scaffold but fails to escalate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    Spatial logic is confusing; the text implies the captain's desk and study are inside the moving elevator without establishing this unusual configuration, creating disorientation. The resolution relies on a magical convenient object (goggles) that instantly decrypts the diary, bypassing protagonist agency and causal effort.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from observation to confrontation to acceptance. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (surrender to the drift), though the tension regarding their physical fate is somewhat muted by the philosophical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    A significant timeline contradiction destabilizes the narrative drive: the opening states the wrecking ball arrives "at dawn," yet the crew is "testing" it and landing the "first blow" by midnight. Additionally, Lira possessing the specific coin needed to unlock the guild’s centuries-old safe relies on convenient coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on convenient dream-logic (a hopscotch board mapping to constellations without explanation) and starlings acting as literal guides. Closure is weak; the return is immediate and costless, resetting the status quo with a vague reward ("a truth").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with convenient causality; the "liquid light" solves the central puzzle without ingenuity or significant cost. The closure affirms success but lacks a felt price or decisive shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("Each morning," "The settlers worked for hours") rather than a specific, pressure-filled scene. The resolution creates "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved completely by a collective effort that meets no on-page resistance, draining the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a distinct beginning, middle, and end that adheres to the Causal lens. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the world softens—lands with the tangible cost of the shattered puppet head. However, the mechanism relies heavily on dream logic (puppet head = map) that strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear situational drive and "Earned Stasis" closure where the traveler escapes but Kael remains bound. The central constraint ("leave impressions without touching") is phrased ambiguously; it seemingly contradicts the immediate action of "arranging stones," confusing the story's causal logic regarding the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "Weeks later" summary epilogue to resolve the arc, diffusing the tension of the studio scene. The immediate scene ends on a hopeful note, but the story over-explains the resolution in the coda, violating the preference for on-page closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from a "soft reset" ending where the sold item (and its potential danger) returns to the protagonist as a harmless musical note, negating the transaction's cost. The closure lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost," offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive change or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual to crisis to resolution with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (the shift in how he carries the weight). The closure is earned and satisfyingly understated. The structure suffers mid-scene, however, when the guard's arrival functions as a false cliffhanger—resolving via luck rather than character action—which deflates tension rather than complicating the central task.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression where obstacles are resolved instantly by magic (singing to the weight), lacking causal friction. The ending is a textbook example of "Symmetric Satisfaction" where a complex social rift is healed instantly by a clock chime, creating an unearned "explain-everything" resolution without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution track without significant causal friction or unexpected cost. The obstacle (the feedback loop) is introduced and resolved within a few paragraphs via "adjusting dials," making the victory feel inevitable and mechanically earned rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the "gravity inversion" functions as a puzzle solution rather than a complication. Closure consists of simple acquisition (getting the key) and role acceptance without a legible "felt or conceptual cost" required by the rubric; the protagonist gains power without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the climax (shattering insulator) resolves into a summary-heavy denouement that drains tension. The transition from the breakthrough to teaching the entire grove happens in exposition rather than dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality breaks significantly at the climax with a Deus Ex Machina: the protagonist fortuitously possesses a student's gift key that opens an ancient magical relic. The closure is "symmetric satisfaction" without felt cost, resolving the central mystery too easily to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution relies on a "magical fix" (opening a rusted mechanical lock by humming and using a tuning fork) that breaks suspension of disbelief in a non-fantasy setting. The ending lacks a felt cost; the protagonist gains wisdom without sacrifice or trade-off, resulting in a low-stakes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the scope default by presenting a montage of a growing season ("Weeks passed") rather than a continuous scene. The resolution lacks causal weight, as the elders' opposition evaporates instantly upon the bloom without earned negotiation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on "video game logic" where a random artifact finds a perfectly shaped socket in a massive world, breaking suspension of disbelief. The climax confuses the timeline: gravity inverts "forever" in one paragraph, then "resettles" in the next, muddling the permanence of the change. Closure is achieved through mechanical ease rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is functional but suffers from a disconnect at closure. The shift from a "hungry, alive machine" to a bureaucratic recommendation of "breakaway panels" creates a tonal incongruity that undercuts the horror; the protagonist exits without a felt cost or significant sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "attempt yields success" arc with no escalation or setbacks, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt cost. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction" where all conflict dissolves into harmony, lacking the requisite pressure for a publishable literary story.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the closure (breaking the flute, accepting the silence) is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The logic holds well under a Causal lens, though the "magic lesson" mechanism feels slightly convenient for the character's internal needs.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the climax resolves through a "soft reset" where internal understanding magically halts external chaos. The inciting incident and rising action work well, but the resolution lacks a concrete, paid price; the machine simply obeys because the protagonist "understood." This simplifies the conflict rather than resolving it through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina (the mysterious woman) to explain the plot and resolve the conflict. The closure is a "magic solves everything" moment, lacking causal density or a sense of earned cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident and a distinct climax where the frost shatters. The ending achieves Conceptual Repricing as Mara accepts the mirror nature of the quartz. The causality is slightly weakened by the convenient timing of the physical shattering, which functions as a deus ex machina to force the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a static situation to a decisive change via the puzzle mechanism. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's role shifts from passive waiter to active transmitter—lands well. The arrival of the box is a permissible coincidence that incites action without resolving the conflict cheaply.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a predictable linear fetch-quest structure where the inciting incident leads directly to a "magic button" resolution. The ending—where touching an orb instantly heals the entire planet—lacks causal weight and mechanical satisfaction, as the global fix feels unearned by the brief physical trial.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a legible portal-fantasy arc with a clear inciting incident and resolution. However, the causality relies heavily on dream logic—the shard opens the door simply because it does, and throwing it closes the door without established mechanics. The "truth" revealed is abstract ("it's a choice"), making the closure feel conceptually light despite the decisive physical action of discarding the key.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    A critical continuity error occurs in the climax: Elias places the sea glass "on the sill" (para 6), but in the final paragraph, it is "warm in his pocket" without him retrieving it. Additionally, the resolution decouples from the established stakes; the physical danger of an unlit lighthouse is solved by a sentimental ritual, leaving the external threat (ships crashing) unaddressed.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear setup-to-climax path but lacks a valid closure unit with felt cost. The ending ("she was ready") is a soft landing/affirmation of competence rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The "darkness" mentioned creates no actual complication or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (loss of the wing, acceptance of role) lands with a clear change in state. However, the causal link between the wing's reflection and the patron’s storytelling relies on a situational/magical coincidence rather than strict character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative proceeds as a linear checklist of tasks (dismantle, sketch, enter) without causal friction or a pivot point where the outcome is in doubt. Closure is achieved through a "success" state (the wall opens) rather than a decisive change with cost; the ending feels like an unearned reward (access and epiphany) rather than a resolution derived from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with no resistance; Lira hums, and the magic works instantly. The closure brings a "Decisive Change" (light returns), but it feels unearned because the opposition (darkness) is passive. The ending relies on a "magic fix" rather than a consequence of a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" structure (invitation → password → book → map → key) with no resistance or causal complication. The "test" of the mirrors is resolved immediately by the leader's intervention, turning the plot into a tour rather than a story with earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is coherent, with a legible inciting incident and resolution. However, the causality is dream-logic (bread turning into seed) rather than character-driven consequence, and the closure relies on a "realization" that feels granted by the setting rather than earned through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails the closure requirement; the ending is a "soft reset" where magic is restored and exhaustion vanishes without any visible or felt cost. The resolution ("faster this time") breaks causality, relying on video-game logic rather than a narrative turn, resulting in symmetric satisfaction that undermines the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is solid, moving from orientation to crisis to resolution, and the closure (broken watch, preserved secret) lands with cost. However, the transition from the "tangle of false starts" to the specific location relies on convenient eavesdropping ("—the device is in the Clocktower Stall") rather than active deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a static "arrival and explanation" structure where a secondary character appears solely to decode the plot. The climax—a sensory overload followed by a lecture—lacks a decisive protagonist choice that alters the outcome. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (regret), but it feels unearned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear dream-logic path where the protagonist acts and the world yields immediately, lacking causal friction or resistance. While the shadow-door mechanism is visually creative, the "lock" solution feels convenient and symbolic rather than earned by prior setup or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a solid causal chain, with the map and plate leading logically to the confrontation. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—redefining the Archive from a vault of words to a seedbed of energy—though the mechanics of "planting" a sound orb rely on poetic rather than strict causal logic. The ending provides a legible shift in the protagonist's understanding of her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene/two-shard scope default with a summary montage ("Days passed"), dissipating tension and converting the climax into a passive observation of time. The ending relies on a soft reset (the ice finishes melting) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's agency, leading to low closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on symbolic logic ("burning" abstract fears to "miniaturize" them) that lacks causal grounding even within a sci-fi premise. The resolution—burning the box and absorbing the orb—works immediately on the first attempt without complication or adaptation, resulting in a low-tension procedural. The connection between the magnetic shift and the box’s seals fraying feels like an arbitrary convenience to force the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.5)
    A fatal causality break occurs at the climax: the narrative explicitly states the locket contains only "a date: 1943," yet Clara later dials a three-part combination based on birth and enlistment dates that were never established. Additionally, the mailbox is described as having a keyhole she tried keys on, but later resolves as a combination lock. These contradictions destroy narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    Causality strains significantly at the climax where dancing "humbles" and confuses security drones. The resolution relies on poetic logic that breaks the established physical threat level, resulting in a low-cost victory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on convenient causality; the use of coffee grounds to unlock a physical door lacks established logic and feels arbitrary. Closure creates a "Conceptual Repricing" (memories are preserved, not lost), but it arrives as a gift without a significant, dramatized cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: arrive, perform ritual, succeed. It lacks a "Decisive Change" with felt cost; the resolution is a symmetric satisfaction where the problem is solved cleanly and the summoner leaves smiling. The stakes (chaos) remain abstract and never pressure the causality on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is excellent, anchoring the scene immediately. However, the narrative arc relies on a dense explanation block that resolves the central mystery too abruptly to feel earned. The closure works as a decisive state change (waking the building), but the lack of prior obstacles makes the climax feel inevitable rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of problem-to-solution, but the resolution relies on a magical soft reset rather than character agency with cost. The "resonance structures" mechanic appears as a convenient plot device to dissolve the conflict. Closure is achieved through a change in state, but the lack of a felt price makes the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and procedural, lacking a decisive turn or deepening of stakes within the scene itself. While the closure functions as a "Charged Poise" (the completed work left for discovery), the lack of on-page obstacles makes the resolution feel like the inevitable conclusion of a task rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" structure where the protagonist climbs, receives exposition, and accepts it without struggle. Closure relies on a realization granted by an NPC rather than earned through decisive action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    A critical logic break undermines the timeline: the sailor died "a century ago," yet his brother and widow are still alive and dreaming, which is biologically impossible in a realistic setting. Additionally, the closure is low-cost and summary-heavy, resolving complex grief with a simple decision to "weave truth" without visible difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is linear but lacks causal tension; the transition from the whistle to the sudden "code" epiphany relies on a convenient interpretive leap rather than earned narrative pressure. Closure is a soft conceptual repricing (nature has intent) that arrives without resistance or meaningful consequences for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot relies on a mid-story summary of letters to explain the magic system, and the climax hinges on a murky distinction between "decoy" and "sacrifice" that contradicts Crane’s earlier motivation. The resolution is driven by an "intuition" shortcut rather than established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative drive is weak because the protagonist is passive, waiting for external signals to dictate his next move. The plot progresses through convenient radio instructions rather than causal agency, leading to a climax that feels more symbolic than earned. Closure offers a grand declaration of a "new dawn" but lacks a visible, felt cost or a concrete change in the status quo beyond the protagonist's internal acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success—he finds the box, it works instantly, and the village accepts it—stripping the story of tension. The inclusion of meta-commentary on the poem's length `(Oops—too long. Let’s trim.)` disrupts the fictional dream and breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative arc is functional but linear; the climax relies on an unearned epiphany ("the term clicking into place") rather than causal pressure. The resolution—the antagonist bowing and vanishing—lacks resistance, resulting in a low-cost, symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative tension dissipates after the mid-point success, trailing into a didactic epilogue that explains the theme. The shift to summary ("In the weeks that followed") undercuts the closure's impact by removing immediate stakes and diffusing the inciting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a severe causality break: finding paper files explicitly marked "Eliminate" inside a damp subway wall is a convenient "loot drop" that bypasses actual investigation. Additionally, the lantern’s logic breaks consistency, shifting from replaying historical memories to projecting a villain's direct address ("Memory is a weapon"), which confuses the rule set.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality suffers from a false setup; the suspicion of a "hidden purpose" dissolves into a platitude ("repairing lives") rather than a concrete discovery. The resolution is unearned, relying on a soft reset where a single prop dissolves all opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from puzzle to epiphany to action, securing a solid structure. The closure lands a Decisive Change (the bell rings), and sacrificing the arrow tip—her compass—provides a tangible cost, though the "dream logic" of the solution (pressing the tip to glass to solve navigation) relies heavily on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot follows a linear, predictable path; the ending relies on a vague escape ("already gone") where the physical choreography of evading the drones is elided for melodrama. The "gateway" functions as a convenient device rather than an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where abstract metaphors ("weaving threads") resolve physical threats without established mechanism or cost. A significant logic break occurs with the "weighted breath before reply" line, which references a conversation in a solitary scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality breaks significantly during the climax; using a "delicate silver filigree" parasol tip to haul a wooden boat and person out of ice defies physical logic and shatters immersion. The ending shifts to a journalistic summary ("The rescue made the local news"), creating a soft reset that distances the reader from the immediate aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" closure where a single conversation resolves deep artistic crisis without visible cost. The causality is thematic—the letter acts as a magic key—rather than dramatic, leading to a resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: arrival, ritual, success, departure. There are no reversals, obstacles, or causal pivots; everything proceeds exactly as intended without doubt or cost. The closure is purely symmetric satisfaction ("it is done," "balance was restored") rather than a reconfiguration of stakes or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and low-stakes, relying on a coincidental bird appearance to trigger an epiphany. The ending offers a "soft reset" where a sudden, possibly magical shift ("vines had climbed higher overnight") resolves the thematic question without causal groundwork. The realization is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on an associative leap (crystal reflects light -> growth is non-linear) rather than causal progression. The closure is a "soft" realization without a decisive change in tactics or a felt price paid. The plot consists largely of internal monologue triggered by a static object, lacking external pressure or genuine narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a coherent conceptual acceptance, but the climax relies on environmental convenience (the fog thinning) rather than agentic causality or a decisive move, reducing the sense of an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that breaks causality; the connection between a "leaf falling" and the clock's frequency is metaphorical, yet it solves a physical problem. The twist that the observatory is a spaceship lacks sufficient setup, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and predictable, moving from diagnosis to death without complication or unexpected turns. While the closure (the gift of the shard) provides a resonant image, the lack of causal resistance—the music works instantly and perfectly—flattens the narrative drive. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the patient's transition is seamless, lacking the grit of a true struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot is a linear progression of problem-solving without setbacks or costs. A significant logic/orientation flaw exists: the protagonist seeks the behavior of shadows "at noon" but conducts all work and achieves the breakthrough in a "nocturnal observatory" at night. The closure—a sudden success—feels unearned by the low-pressure setup.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.0)
    The resolution relies on the convenient, unearned arrival of Elias and an improvised "bone-setting" magic that fixes the problem without cost. The ending offers a "soft reset" rather than a decisive change driven by causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure (creation to release) with legible closure in the final image. However, the central causal link—the weighing of the pearl—lacks friction, as the scale balances perfectly on the first try, reducing narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—modifying the pendant to include moss—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration that embodies the change. However, the path to this closure lacks obstacles; the transition from fear to acceptance is smoothed over by agreement rather than earned through struggle or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a legible Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing at the closure. However, the cause-and-effect relies heavily on dream logic where the solution is handed to the protagonist. The inciting incident and resolution unfold linearly with little complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a linear procedural structure where the ritual succeeds without complication or reversal. While closure is achieved via the restoration of magic, the lack of narrative resistance or a distinct turning point flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with a "smooth success" outcome; the opposition (fickle starlight) fails to manifest as an active obstacle. Closure is achieved without a felt cost or meaningful complication, resulting in a tidy resolution that lacks narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural path where the solution is achieved through summary rather than dramatized crisis. The ending provides &quot;symmetric satisfaction&quot;—the problem is solved exactly as intended—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to give the closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal/Situational hybrid arc with an effective "Earned Stasis" closure where Kael chooses to leave his mother's burden. The progression from the easy thorn-burden to the resistant obsidian, culminating in the renunciation of the locket, provides a solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative suffers from a significant time-logic break. The story frames the action around a boiling kettle, but the carving process described ("mane detailed with care") and the passage of time ("candle burned low," "kettle had long since gone cold") vastly exceed the implied timeframe of the prompt element. Attempting to wave this away with "the loft existed outside time" reads as a convenience patch rather than a functional magical realist element.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc follows a clear causal path to a Decisive Change (dropping the wheel), providing legible closure. However, the ending shifts into magical realism (the appearance of the rose and note) without sufficient causal setup, disconnecting the resolution from the established logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure follows a linear "and then" progression with soft, magical causality disguised as engineering; using a sextant to "reroute" water and electricity into a "formula for hope" breaks suspension of disbelief in a non-fantasy context. The closure lacks a decisive turn or felt cost—Lila simply succeeds at her first attempt and plans to return, resulting in a low-stakes, episodic ending.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from the established status quo to a surreal disruption and a resonant conceptual repricing at closure. The bear's intervention acts as a clear catalyst, and the final image of Lira re-engaging with her work under a new paradigm lands well.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on a magical object that conveniently points to the solution, removing all investigative friction. The climax involves finding a literal blueprint for "controlling the narrative," which feels meta-fictional and unearned. Closure is a cost-free realization that relies on this convenient discovery rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands, but the mechanics are convenient; the "lock-and-key" decoding of the rope lacks friction, and the resolution depends on a "mysterious stranger" deus ex machina who appears solely to explain the theme. The ending feels like a lecture rather than an earned narrative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of convenient events without causal friction; the protagonist arrives, uses a magical ability without difficulty, and receives instant closure. The ending offers a "tidy bow" resolution where all absences are explained and the character leaves happier, lacking any narrative tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    The sudden arrival of the tutor breaks the causal logic of the established solitude, serving as a convenient resolution device. The closure offers a massive payoff (world restoration) for minimal on-page cost (adjusting a lens), lacking the requisite trade-off or struggle for a high-stakes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    The climax relies on a significant break in physical credibility; a bird with a freshly broken wing cannot "soar" immediately after a crude splinting, especially dragging a metal coin. This "magic healing" undermines the story's realism and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear list of acquisitions ("The first," "The next") without escalating difficulty or causal linkage. The climax relies on a Deus Ex Machina vision ("Show me") where the universe conveniently provides the answer, leading to a tidy, symmetric resolution with no narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on a convenient encounter—a ghost appearing to explain the central mystery—which lowers the narrative tension. The inciting incident (the pinging) leads linearly to the solution without significant obstacles or complications, resulting in a low-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene window with a summary montage ("returned... each evening") that dissipates tension. The climax relies on the spectral voice explaining the thematic realization ("grief is not a burden") rather than the protagonist earning it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a high-convenience resolution where the protagonist finds a tool with the exact solution inscribed upon it just in time. This undercuts causality and reduces the closure to a "fix-it" reset without a legible, earned cost or irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot relies on convenience and instant clarity; Elara immediately understands a complex ancient code without trial or error. The ending is a soft reset where she simply reburies the object, resulting in no changing of the status quo or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a "weeks passed" montage that elides the actual struggle, jumping straight to a symmetric resolution where the protagonist is simply right. The mechanism of "predictive modeling" functions as convenient magic rather than a causal tool, creating a low-tension "manifesting" plot.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear vignette (tunes radio, hears song, records lyrics, leaves) rather than a story with a causal arc. There is no Decisive Change or Reconfiguration; the ending reiterates the status quo established in the opening. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation lacks a turning point or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative structure is a static vignette rather than a causal sequence; the protagonist enters, performs a task, and leaves without a decisive turn or cost. Closure is predictable and lacks a felt price, as the "unfinished" nature of the work is presented as an intentional method rather than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from stasis to a confrontation that forces a change in the status quo (Mara listening). The closure—a shared moment of "listening"—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the mechanism of Mara's conversion relies on a sudden atmospheric shift rather than a strictly earned causal step, softening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on convenience; a violin with "rusted shut" hinges is played moments later without process or struggle. The ending dissolves into a summary montage ("Clara invited others... choir grew") rather than delivering a decisive scene-level closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear process (wait, prune, succeed) lacking a decisive turn that alters the protagonist's path. The closure relies on an unearned "future memory" vision that resolves the tension perfectly, bypassing the established rule of the seed containing past lives and negating any sense of sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on "magical thinking" where a single interaction with a child instantly repairs a city-wide infrastructure failure, lacking proportional causality. The "explain-everything" dialogue from Voss removes narrative tension and solves the mystery through exposition rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear success sequence (theory to test to success) without obstruction or complication. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction—the magic works exactly as intended—lacking the required cost (visible, felt, or conceptual) to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a massive exposition dump (“The first revelation... The second... The third...”) to bridge the climax, which kills momentum and substitutes summary for dramatization. The causality of the resolution—drinking a vial found in a statue to cure an ocean-wide blight—is magical and tenuous, lacking a logical mechanism or setup. The ending feels unearned because the solution was handed to the protagonist by the statue.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean with a distinct climax (the rupture) and a valid Conceptual Repricing at the closure where the protagonist reweights the value of possession. The logic of "punching stone based on math" operates on dream logic, which fits the setting, and the closure cost—leaving the dice behind—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence (painting a stranger who turns out to be the neighbor's mother) that resolves the conflict without earned effort. Additionally, a causality break occurs: the narrative claims she painted the eyes based on the "ache in his voice" (para 9), but the scene shows her painting them *before* he enters or speaks (para 5-6).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot suffers from a "fix-it" progression where the protagonist decides to act and immediately succeeds without complication. Crucially, the central causal metaphor is contradictory: the thaw is introduced as a destructive force ("thawed into oblivion") then immediately pivots to a generative one ("chance to rebuild") without reconciling the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal arc is solid, moving from a failed attempt to a calibrated success via specific action. While the "feedback loop" explanation relies on light technobabble, the narrative logic holds within the fable-like frame. The closure is decisive and alters the world state.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot relies on a "magic instruction manual" convenience where the solution is read aloud just in time, bypassing genuine deductive struggle. While the ending offers a twist regarding Vey, the resolution of the primary conflict (the shadow) feels mechanical and low-cost. The logic of the paradox ("welcoming" equals "lying") is asserted rather than earned through narrative causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational arc, moving from the threat of disorder to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the setting. The pacing is solid, and the closure—order restored through the integration of chaos—lands with physical cost ("arms ached"), though the linear progression lacks a sharp causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative drive is clear, but the closure relies on a logic that wobbles under scrutiny. The reveal that the gate "rusted shut" to keep humans in contradicts the passive nature of rust (entropy) versus the implied intentional design of a prison. Additionally, the pivot from the "countdown" realization to the gate twist feels thematically disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience; the protagonist is guided to the solution by a coincidental encounter (Tomas) rather than active deduction or struggle. The climax—finding the chamber—is granted rather than earned, reducing the narrative drive to a guided tour. The "final petal" constraint sets a timer but does not causally pressure the subsequent investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.2)
    A significant causal break undermines the premise: the drawbridge is said to "isolate" the pavilion, yet Elara easily "wades" to it, rendering the isolation mechanism ornamental and the stakes (being trapped) false. Additionally, the discovery of the grandmother’s specific desk with initials intact is a massive, unearned coincidence that resolves the mystery without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.4)
    The central obstacle is resolved by a massive coincidence: the random antique stamp Lira salvaged happens to be the physical key to the vault. This "lock-and-key" convenience bypasses genuine problem-solving and breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative builds a lethal threat (the shadow that "tore her brother"), but resolves it with a "soft reset" where the antagonist simply dissolves upon being acknowledged. This lacks a decisive causal turn or commensurate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, with the "circuit breakers" providing effective ticking-clock tension that forces the inciting action. The closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (destruction of safety for power), though the "superhero origin" beat at the very end feels slightly more genre-standard than literary.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    The climax suffers from a choreography break; Lira deploys a grappling hook to the apex but is then told to pull a lever at the base, creating spatial confusion. The resolution relies on an NPC (the pilgrim) explaining the solution ("It's in the alignment") rather than the protagonist earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear Decisive Change at closure, but the causality relies on a "magic solve" (psychometric driftwood) that creates a jarring genre shift from the noir-genealogist setup. The transition from realistic investigation to supernatural vision is unearned, acting as a convenient shortcut to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the ending provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration via the drawer pull. However, the climax—the exchange itself—is summarized ("The exchange went smoothly"), dissipating the tension built up in the first half and reducing the plot to a container for reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a legible Decisive Change (leaving the compass) that provides clear closure. The pacing is competent, though the inciting incident (the fight) is backstory, making the on-page action a linear processing of prior events rather than a developing crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from the inciting discovery to the subterranean journey and a conceptual resolution. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s stance toward her past shifts—but the "cost" is philosophical rather than viscerally paid on the page. The orientation and causal links are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ritual structure provides a clear arc with legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) and physical cost. However, the progression is strictly linear without complications; the victory over fear feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sequence follows a dream logic that fits the genre, but the closure relies on a "gift ending" where the saucer heals and the handprint appears magically. This lacks the "visible or felt cost" required by the rubric; the resolution fixes the external symbol without extracting a price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.7)
    The resolution relies on a "magic fix" where an internal realization instantly repairs complex mechanical systems without logical causality. The climax lacks friction; the obstacle dissolves immediately upon contact, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned. Closure is achieved, but the lack of causal rigor undermines the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a "mysterious stranger explains the plot" structure, which drains causal tension. The resolution—a sudden realization of peace after being told change is "violent"—feels unearned by the preceding events. The magical shift in the sand at the end reads as a disconnected effect rather than a causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a sense of cost or obstacle; the central puzzle is solved instantly with a convenient key, bypassing potential conflict. Closure is achieved mechanically (door opens) without an emotional or tactical price paid by the characters. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear trial-and-error loop, but the climax wavers in agency; the curse reveals the "correct" future before Lira fully commits to the final action, softening the risk of her choice. The "not yet" realization feels rushed, arriving more from plot necessity than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.5)
    The scene is coherent, but the inciting incident and resolution rely on the convenience of a found note containing the exact thematic key needed. Closure lands on a decision, but the causality feels lucky rather than earned by character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on "dream logic" where a sewing card inexplicably aligns with a sundial to form a map; this causal leap is asserted via dialogue ("recontextualized") rather than earned through plot mechanics. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of prior setup for the card-sundial connection makes the resolution feel contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.7)
    Orientation logic fails early: the "skeletal... corrugated" ruin conflicts with the "prison library" designation and the vagrant’s easy access, breaking the story's reality (-0.4). The resolution relies on a deus ex machina (the mysterious poem) rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on a "convenient room" trope that acts as a soft reset, dissolving the central tension without consequence. Additionally, the spatial logic of a spiral staircase accessible through a piano bench’s false bottom strains physical plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands clearly with the seed's sacrifice. However, the pivot point relies on a vision that explicitly explains the stakes ("This is what happens if we forget"), which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no meaningful setbacks or reversals; the magic system solves the central problem immediately without trial or error. Causality is soft; the connection between lace and the compass is asserted rather than demonstrated through logic or cost. The ending provides closure but lacks a felt price; the conflict resolves too neatly to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via dust settling and patterning; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her scientific gaze toward humility. The final symposium slide of “dust-caked ferns” crystallizes the before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she’d craft…panels…teach others to read the frost” reweights her art and the ledger’s code; cost is the forfeiture of commercial safety. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of frost, shard, ledger builds to cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: how frost patterns perfectly match burnt ledger lines is asserted not tested, but the lyric design teaches the method early enough to waive strict logistics.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the conservatory plants dance to silent music, reconfiguring silence from wound to instrument with undeniable conceptual cost—she forever forfeits her voice-as-medium. Causal chain holds: capsize trauma → heat-map experiments → Elias’s presence → risked audible fork → global silent concerts. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, default scope met. Cost is legible in the final image—“tuning fork case sat open…captured starlight”—the path foreclosed is ordinary sound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “rest is here now” reweights stillness as beginning, with conceptual cost of lifelong commitment visible. Pattern of lens/light/book imagery taught early; cadence shift at final beam reprises and crystallizes meaning. Orientation clean at 120 w. Causality break slight: shift from refusal to lifelong stay occurs off-page between paragraphs; no intermediate beat shows the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: anonymous donations → Mira’s pattern recognition → bell ringing → public naming → donation pattern replaced by open notes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quiet is re-weighted from imposed silence to chosen communal language, with the spoon-clapper bell as visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 40. One soft spot: the council’s skepticism is told rather than staged, slightly diluting the final triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing pool reweights the premise—unused love is stored interstitially—with undeniable emotional cost felt in Lira’s eased breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of glowing, breath, and light patterns tighten until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“twilight viaduct”). Causality is soft—drop of tear → shift in perception—but acceptable under lyric design; no contradiction at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s photographs stabilize, the fragment dies, and Elara forfeits her voyeuristic power for the creative act of memory-making—cost is legible in the dull metal and her quiet smile. Hyperbolic geometry is the taught pattern; its collapse/reform reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative lens. One soft spot: causality of the fragment’s exact trigger is fuzzy ("as if both were trying to communicate").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as earned stasis: she forfeits the vault’s full bounty to weaponize one vial, a visible cost that reconfigures both her people’s odds and her own state (“the liberator was unchained”). Causal links hold—arrow-map → key sequence → vault → vine burst—though the wall-collapse cue is late; orientation still clears by word 100 with “rusted iron cuffs” anchoring who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each object-layer thickens the betrayal frequency until the final mold cools. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the new aid emits the exact break-sound—so a conceptual cost is legible. However, the forge’s dormant-to-eruptive shift is elided; we leap from cold ash to molten without an on-page ignition beat, a causal gap that nicks the because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors arrive early and spatial choreography holds, so the pattern coheres even if the crucible ignition is telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar re-illuminates her mother’s photo, trading stolen memory for eternal glow—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights her creed. Causal chain is tight: lily → grate → photo → jar; each step triggers the next without convenient amnesia, and the final image crystallizes a new rule—she now plants light instead of merely harvesting it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the cracked bookmark reframed as light-catcher reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he abandons the search for flawless shelters. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each melt-drip intensifies pattern until the schematic reveal; no coincidence resolves the stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (abandoned control room, midday thaw). The price is legible in the final image; persistent constraint (the crack) shapes the last beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight over-narration of “weighty lightness” keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain—shell discovery → notes → decryption → arrest—holds tight; each beat alters options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lila keeps the shell, foreclosing reunion until trust is earned; cost is legible in Marisol’s trembling hands. Orientation anchored by word 80. One transition (library→café) is crisp and motivated. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map glows, the fort darkens, and silence is now portable—an undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent: each summarized silence thickens the texture until the map becomes autonomous. Orientation is swift; place, time, and lone actor are fixed by line 3. One minor loop—“the silence that thrummed… the silence that waited”—dulls the final cadence but does not rupture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: fractal-music repetitions thicken atmosphere until the ice door crystallizes a Charged-Poise closure. Causality is soft—violin appears by author fiat—but pattern coherence lets the final image reweight meaning. Cost is conceptual (eternal looped service) rather than felt, acceptable under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: ticket stub → lens discovery → map → midnight rendezvous → decoding ritual → silence embraced. Each because/therefore linkage narrows Elias’s options until the final choice to stop logging words. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the registrar rule-set is literally overwritten by the doodled lens, a single image that reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost—his job function abdicated. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; the projector lens is seeded early and its cracked glass pays off thematically. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze “blooms—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them,” reweighting the premise that perfection beats brokenness. Causal lattice holds: each vine-redirect causes the maze to recalibrate; marbles accumulate meaning until the final hand-off to Joren. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Cost is palpable—Elara forecloses technological dependency, pays in solitude, and the maze’s final flowering is the receipt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: lever-pull → field spike → destabilization → manual reroute → earned calm, each beat because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: Veyra’s fingers brush the lever again while “icy warmth” reconfigures her future risk; cost is felt in the station’s lingering tremor and her own sweat. Orientation anchored by word 80; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: each dunk, surge, and symbol reveal tightens Clara’s options until the promise to finish the symphony forecloses retreat. Closure is a Charged Poise: the theater “held its breath” while Clara exits, reconfiguring her life’s trajectory with the cost felt in that held breath. Anchors (who/where/when) are nailed inside 120 words; no orientation debt. One minor scuff: the pipe burst is external coincidence, not her agency, yet it functions as final intensifier rather than resolver, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the illustration tube under her coat is the visible price (she can’t return) and the herbalist’s line reweights “cracks” as home, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causal chain is present (dream → smudge → office raid → descent) but the raid beat is compressed to a single paragraph of summary; a beat of real-time discovery (hand shaking on a redacted line) would tighten the therefore linkage and lift the score to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: following rumor → tunnel → valve fits → shaft opens → hologram confession → Elias abandons wheel. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single transition (tunnel→chamber) is legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wheel left behind re-weights the “swallowed truth” with social/human cost rather than supernatural triumph. One minor scaffold: “the weight of a swallowed truth” is named twice; trimming one would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the river’s disappearance crystallizes the keeper’s new stance with undeniable cost (“grip on reality now a faint echo”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each fold deepens texture and narrows the empirical world to silence. The origami swan functions as taught pattern, its relaxing folds mirroring the keeper’s release; transitions are legible, lens coherent. However, escalation is almost entirely atmospheric; no concrete obstacle ever truly tests the stated want, so the cost feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mara’s pocketing the curl is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “ordinary magic” with social cost—Mara now owns Elara’s symbol. Causal chain holds: curl → demonstration → trigger of memory → glow → transfer. No meaningful escalation occurs; eclipse works as stage lighting, not tightening. Setup is clear within 120 words; orientation debt waived because later payoff justifies twilight delay.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the axis re-aligns the instant Elias acknowledges the silo’s chorus, re-weighting silence into story. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each found fragment layers density until the tapestry dragons “stir,” a pattern break that pays off Clara’s smoke ritual. Cost is conceptual but legible: once the voices rise, Elias can never again inhabit quiet isolation; the price is the loss of protective ignorance. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the flare into fog rewrites the game rule “one woman directs history,” and the cost (irreversible commitment to insurgency) is legible. Microdot reveal triggers because/therefore linkage, but the safehouse descent still reads like scenic tour—no obstacle, no failed attempt, no narrowing of options; tension plateaus. Orientation cues arrive by word 60, well inside waiver. Single causal tightening suffices and is present; however, escalatory middle is thin, relying on exposition letters rather than beat-level pressure to foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each rhetorical loop (“silence is absence of noise/noise is absence of silence”) is a because/therefore lever that literally cracks the anchor; the final image of “dynamic equilibrium” is the earned Decisive Change with visible cost—the anchor is gone, the void stabilized, the loops fade. Orientation is anchored inside 50 words; no prop drift; no knowledge leaks. Closure pays off the opening thesis that stillness is a thread—once pulled, tapestry unravels—so causality and theme converge.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the “upturned hush” crystallizes her Earned Stasis—she keeps writing, accepting the cost of exhaustion to resurrect the past. Causality holds: the shell’s hum triggers memory, memory drives the fortune texts, the texts become the symphony. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored/echo motifs tightens until the final silence reweights the stake. One hairline slip: “she’d always felt out of step with time” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: each arch selection therefore spawns a new timeline shard that forces micro-choices under tightening gravity-death threat. Closure lands cleanly—tablet dissolves, feet touch stone, gravity regained—visible cost paid. Orientation is stable; who-where-when anchored within first 110 words. Mosaic shards taught early; transitions legible; pattern pays off in convergent thread image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opening anchors who/where/when inside 80 words; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each reversed record adds density to the cavern’s hush until the drums themselves vibrate, reweighting the stake from “fix the phonograph” to “carry a container of silence.” Closure is a Charged Poise: Lila’s tear-pricked eyes and silent laugh crystallize that the filament’s cost—permanent, muted vibration—has replaced her numbness; the persistent constraint shapes her future teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain holds: trembling needle → rooftop lateral → vial acceptance → recorder log; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he burns the note, accepting lifelong exposure cost—charged by the recorder’s still dials. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The log entry tomorrow is tell-forward, slightly blunting the immediacy of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: scent-images layer until the ultraviolet cascade reweights the stake from “why do I grieve?” to “grief is love’s proof.” The closure is a Charged Poise: the final walk-home image reconfigures stance—she breathes city air without flinch—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is soft: the UV method appears as a late deux-ex-machina rather than a constraint that shapes prior tactics, preventing 8.8+. Orientation is clean by word 60; no teleporting props. One shard only; default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of untangled rope re-weights earlier motifs (dust verses, prison flight) and makes the cost of perpetual escape visible. Causal lattice holds: because he follows the beings → grotto → rope-map offered → chooses unraveling; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 80 with concrete “terra-cotta grotto under starlight.” One hairline slip: the voice’s cosmic exposition (“time is a tapestry…”) momentarily softens causal pressure, but the rope act immediately repays. Meets 9+ quick test on cost and lens, but the slight lecture cadence keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bowl’s warmth and the crowd’s tentative murmur reconfigure silence from wall to threshold, with conceptual cost—the music can never again be only private. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each note swells in the copper curve, density increasing until the chronically hush is repurposed. Orientation is clean by line 5; transitions are single-scene. Cost is legible in the final image—“warm to the touch, alive with vibration.”

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias sealing the spent petal reweights the half-truth economy under an accumulative/textural lens—every sale leaves a residue he stockpiles. Causality holds: the static-charged dusk peak → client arrival → precise vial handed over → petal archived. Cost is legible in the final image: his own empathy is incrementally subsumed into amber walls. No orientation debt; grotto rules taught early via electromagnetic orchid and violet spectacles.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Clara’s ledger now literally displays “Profit, Unseen,” reweighting her commercial lens with conceptual cost; the causal chain (envelope→locket→Lila→forged letter) is linear and uninterrupted, though the early “whimsically attentive” ambiance is more decorative than functional to escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: because orchard fades → therefore search → therefore follow tags → therefore meet Lira → reveal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared ache is crystallized under the obsidian arbor with the constellation thread glowing, reconfiguring isolation into kinship. Cost is felt—“the luminescent ache remained, but now it was shared”—and the lens holds (causal). Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where) are slightly late (~130 words) but the disorientation is functional to the dream-logic and pays off in the final image, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene orientation is clear by 120 words; canal/giant anchors taught early. The causal engine is “twist pendant → time tunnel,” a rule introduced mid-stream yet paid off in closure image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the loom-of-time image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Slight causal thinness: pendant’s mechanics are asserted, not foreshadowed, but the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic-eye dovetail reweights loss from void to fractal orchard, with visible sap-tear cost. Causal chain holds—each step because/therefore—under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught early via dripping stalactites and sap luminescence. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint: the chipped flaw itself dictates the ritual and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: reel → decoder → cache location → resolve to act. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s invisible guardian identity reframed as messenger—with conceptual cost (exposure risk) stated in final line. One causal gap: decoder powers up flawlessly after decades, a light convenience. Orientation, lens, and on-page cost satisfy 600-word default; missing hairline tightening keeps it under 8.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: “because” plant retracts, “therefore” Eleanor must release control; the hellebore’s split stem is the decisively visible change that reconfigures her options. Closure is a Charged Poise—she sits, leaf in pocket, storms accepted—cost felt in the foregone need to dominate. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no ambiguity. One soft spot: Mara’s late-appearing vines are narrated as fait accompli rather than causal trigger, a micro-ebb in because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final canvas reweights the island from tomb to bridge, with felt cost (her insomnia eases because she now carries the brooch’s weight). Causal lens holds throughout: rain → brooch → exchange → pigment → new painting. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one transition (studio → island interior) is legible. The sketchbook’s prior scenes could feel like teleporting information, but the piece teaches its pattern early (“drawings Marin recognized”) so the reveal tightens rather than breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    Causal chain: arrival → mis-sight → gift → collapse → permanent change holds cleanly; midpoint orientation (who/where) is anchored by para-3; closure lands via Charged Poise (“steady, unpredictable hum”) with legible cost. Single scene, no teleporting props. Stake (guardianship of harmony) is declared early and re-weighted at end. No meaningful tightening beat occurs—the pilgrim’s pearl simply detonates—so escalation stays tonal rather than option-narrowing; this caps the 7+ zone.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the trumpet’s first public note reconfigures the harbor’s silence into shared heritage; cost is felt because Lirael surrenders custodial solitude for communal sound. Causality is mosaic-style accumulative: each placement of the valve summons a new witness whose story tightens the weave; no single event causes the next, yet pattern coherence grows. Orientation is swift: “ivory harbor… after the rain” locates us inside two sentences, then docks, plaza, lighthouse keep spatial logic. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; final image re-weights prior absences into audible presence, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: shifting cracks → punch → stair → hologram station → blank ticket; each step shrinks Elias’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the blank ticket reweights every prior map-line; “Begin” repackages his life-long habit into a single costly fork. Cost is visible—the updated map erases his old certainties in the final image. One minor scaffold: “shouldn’t exist” wall is slightly lucky, but the mechanism is seeded, so coincidence complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s copied patterns discharge the tile’s burden, reweighting her stance from dismissive observer to guarded wonder; the whales’ softening song provides audible cost. Causal linkage is light—tile activation is accidental, not a choice—but under an Accumulative lens the density of mirrored stargazers and whale hymns lands cleanly. Orientation is secure by word 60; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices; escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: storm → dimensional warp → amulet resonance → Lira → joint release; each beat tightens options. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by word 80. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—amulets shatter, prison collapses—felt cost is the vertiginous void they choose. One minor loop: “hushed thunder” is named three times without new causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: ink pot → mind-reading → leverage → asylum papers; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change: she exits with documents and a new public identity as negotiator, father alive but forever hidden—felt cost legible in the emptied pot. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One minor causality squeak: agents accept her telepathic claim without verification beat, but it doesn’t rupture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a lyrical CR: the dawn-hum fades and Althea smiles, embracing infinite possibility; the cost is conceptual—she surrenders certainty for endless invention. Causality is accumulative/textural: each dawn adds parchment layers until the hum synchronizes with breath, reweighting her vocation. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear inside 120 words and the pattern holds, but the “price” is abstract; no tool breaks, no tram returns, no page is lost, so the resonance is luminous rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice: the locket photo proves Marcus alive, instantly reweighting every fragment he has hoarded. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each story-fragment thickens the texture of memory until the mosaic snaps into identity. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“salt tang of the harbor”), well within the 120-word guardrail. One minor loop—“the tide retreated, leaving the labyrinth slick and gleaming” repeats the earlier tide motif without new pressure—stops this at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the glowing staff in dust reframes every prior beat—shell, cello, 11:59 panel—into a single resonant score. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (keening shell, rattling glass) tightens the stakes until meaning, not plot, is reconfigured. Causality is intact: because she plays, the panel spins; therefore the dust-song appears. Cost is palpable—she descends with “ache in her chest,” melody dissolving into wind, foreclosing her old debunking self.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: graffiti code → translated map → Council confrontation → retreat, each beat because/therefore linked. The spiral-square symbol landing as rallying banner provides a crisp visual pivot that reweights options. Closure achieves Charged Poise: carnival still afloat, dual loyalty intact, threat only momentarily repelled—cost is societal, not personal, but legible in the mist-capped barge retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archived shadow reweights her gesture, cost legible in “gather dust.” Causal spine holds—sand grain dissolves because dawn arrives, photo taken because drones arrive—yet the drones’ arrival is external, not worsened by her choices. Orientation is swift (<120 words) and the lens is stable (Accumulative/Textural). No teleporting props; chronology clean.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the repaired drone launches with the ship, but Lira stays behind to the next broken thing—cost felt in the dripping depot silence. Causal linkage holds: servo-misalignment → water-refraction insight → patch → flight proves fix. Orientation anchored by word 60 (rail depot, mist, dawn). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (water-light returns) tightens at final basin-glow. Persistent constraint: endless repair queue keeps her earth-bound while her birds sail.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each condensation trace, falcon shadow, and glowing ice shard layers until the plateau revelation reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara’s maps now spiral with light, a felt conceptual cost that forecloses her old cartographic certainty. No causal gaps; transitions are legible within the two-shard frame.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last fork-tone bridges past/future while Kael exits, reconfiguring the stake from revival to self-exile. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each fork-strike thickens footstep texture until cobblestones, fountain, bell lock into harmonic motion; the final image makes the cost of Kael’s exile legible without exposition. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. One minor loop: “rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones” is stated three times with near-identical phrasing—accept in lyric mode but keeps this below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the temple’s hush thickens through sensory layers until the vial’s scent ruptures the pattern, delivering a decisive conceptual reprice—Mara’s release of the memories. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the single-scene descent tightens once via the pressure squeeze through the fissure. Closure lands in the empty yet radiant vial beside her, a charged image that reweights the premise: preservation through letting go. The only drag is a mid-paragraph editorial echo—“the hush was a prison, and Mara was its jailer”—which over-articulates what the chamber already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lattice, scuffs, copperlight accrue density until silver chamber re-prices meaning. Closure—lattice clink + reef view—earns Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts narrative responsibility at visible cost (bodies still unfound). Orientation lands by line 3; spatial logic clean. Single causal hiccup: identical twin appears without prior seed, but pays off thematic doubling so waived minor.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: dawn fractures, the bead turns warm, and the greenhouse’s rule-set reverts from eternal stasis to living season. Causal chain holds—pomegranate/bead resonance is set up, the incantatory debt is foretold, and the final fruit-split directly frees both souls under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is unmistakable in the single image “the bead warm in her hand,” reweighting centuries of coldness. One minor scaffold: the greenhouse’s rune-rule is stated twice in adjacent sentences near the open, a −0.2 artifact that does not touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stitched thread literally reweights the labyrinth’s fabric, culminating in a Charged Poise—the glowing maze as hymn—whose cost is the emptied, color-bled plates; causality is lyric rather than plot-strict, but the before/after of cracked→living stone is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shrine’s pulse reconfigures diaspora absence into possible return with visible communal cost—villagers arriving at orchard’s edge. Causal chain intact: sundial → alignment → harmonic tone → convergence. Reflection kept under 20 % and tied to present stimuli. No orientation debt; anchor who/where by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (margin scan → fountain dip → chip insert) obeys a because/therefore logic that progressively narrows Lira’s options to “teach.” Closure lands as Decisive Change with legible cost—she forecloses anonymity by accepting the grandmother’s public baton. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no set-up teleporting. Only minor slack: the arcade AI’s approval is unmotivated by any prior constraint, a hairline softening of causality.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the galaxy knot straightens under flame, reweighting the premise that decoration is harmless. Causal chain—telescope move → chart revelation → flame test—tightens once, sufficient for length. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. Persistent constraint: the eternal flame now marks her as rebel to any initiate who looks.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation-letters function as pattern-break that reweights sorrow into tangible beauty; closure is Charged Poise—Lirael exits lighter, shard now smooth—cost legible as irreversible farewell to regret. Orientation clear by 120 wds; no teleporting props; single transition (dusk→dawn) is marked by moonset and fade of songs. Spirits’ music supplies causal texture: because song swells, droplets form; because droplets dissolve, she accepts impermanence. Shard glow → soil is the priced constraint that shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the coral placed between factions crystallizes new options with undeniable conceptual cost—she has staked her credibility on a fragment of ruin. Causal linkage holds: because she decrypts the cast, therefore she re-weights language, therefore she risks the coral at the table. One minor scaffold—three “she wondered” sentences in 30 words—does not touch the final image. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 70; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens: each shard of light/story thickens the texture until the fresco’s laughter reconfigures the district’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s grinning “Everything” crystallizes the new rule that joy can be developed. Cost is conceptual but legible: the fog’s monopoly on memory is broken, future murals will demand new risks. One minor slip: “knowledge network” arrives late as a tell; if its notes had constrained an earlier failed attempt, escalation would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mural reseals, the nickel returns to pocket, and Marisol accepts an open-ended “rhythm of awakening” with audible lullaby cost. Causal chain (coin-etching → harmonic scatter → latent pigment resonance) is tight, taught on-page, and reweights her future work. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Only the grandfather-to-flapper genealogic link is asserted, not traced, a micro-groove short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: coded phrase → seed quest → orchid test → hidden door → club vote → luminous garden. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing garden is now legible from satellites, a public defiance whose cost is the certainty of surveillance reprisal—felt even though not yet enacted. One soft spot: the seed’s “Class-3 disruptor” label is exposition dropped at the table rather than a constraint that shapes tactics during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the tree’s wild chorus crystallizes the “blossom armistice” concept and lets Lira relinquish sleeplessness; cost is felt in the iridescent seed’s irreplaceable absence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of poems, songs, glowing moss—pattern taught early, cadence shift at blooming tree. The centuries montage risks mild orientation drift, but migratory shell and postcard re-anchors keep it legible. One soft spot: “insomnia faded” is asserted, not dramatized; a sharper micro-beat of her eyelids closing against her own earlier vow would have nailed causality and lifted it into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of resonance > causality. Anchors—who/where/when—arrive by line 5; orientation waived because disorientation is later paid off in the auroral reveal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cracked tube becomes a new conduit, reweighting the whole preservation ethic; cost is felt in the swirling mist of liberated feelings. No plot amnesia; every object (etched runes, toolkit, orchid shimmer) recurs with altered meaning, tightening the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: faded love letter → river name → tax record → prayer book → mead → wedding vow → Elara dials. Each “because” widens emotional stakes until the manuscript of two sisters refracts her own estrangement, forcing the call. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—dawn light, empty ink well, her voice “trembling.” Orientation arrives by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Henrik’s late key is a mild convenience, but it complicates, not rescues, so penalty stays minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands: the decrypted confession reweights the floodgate metaphor from mechanical to emotional, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—“I fear my heart will break, but I trust you to mend it.” Causal linkage is tight: adhesive analysis → cipher key → compassion unlocked. The amphitheater’s breathing provides coherent situational pressure; no coincidences intrude. Orientation is clean by word 80; only the late-arriving “geological-musical cipher” rule could have been seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, ledger entries, and song fragments layer until a new map crystallizes. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias abandons the attic sanctuary, momentum shifted by the dream injunction “the echo is in the space between.” Cost is legible: he forfeits income, client trust, and the shelter of fabrication. One causal micro-gap: the anonymous mailing of the chip is never sourced, but it is the necessary inciting rupture, not a resolver, so allowed under Situational complication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the father/terrace dissolve behind her and the blank logbook page becomes her own code—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds: grain-reading → path revealed → door opens; ellipsis (why father left) is deliberate and paid off by final image. Orientation is swift (“prism terrace drifted above the cornfield”). Logbook codes never break into literal plot use, but work as thematic spine, not prop—allowed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the shared exhale reweights belonging from abstract wish to collective moment. Causality is accumulative/image-driven; the alignment arrives externally, not because of Mara’s acts. The lens holds, but the cost is diffuse—loss of solitude rather than a foreclosed path. Timed sunrise acts as soft boundary, not tightening constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands: Lira’s realization that paths are “released, not forgotten” is a clean Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—seed pattern → shard memory → pool dissolution. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is elegant: hidden pattern → teen’s pause → fountain flare → collective drift, each step legible and on the page. The closure beat lands as Charged Poise—the arcade freezes, lights refract, Lira packs up—so the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, satisfying the lens but soft. The Orientation Test is waived: the tidal arcade’s salt breath and cracked clown are taught early and refract in the final image. The only drag is a mild explanatory nudge (“Not ordering. Guiding”) that tells us the trick we already see.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the garden recedes, the verse will fade, yet Lirael’s “elective exile” crystallizes with undeniable social/ontological cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of shedding/anchoring intensifies until the final image reweights the stake. Causality holds: because she steals the dust → dances → pens the verse, therefore she is now exiled from both ban-ruled world and full transcendence. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by word 70 (“twilight garden’s star-spangled canopy”).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers sensory strata (mist, ripples, refracted light) until the final image reweights the premise—“even the smallest things can hold the light”—a conceptual repricing with quiet cost. Causality is loose: the stone throw is not a turning point but a trigger for meditation; nothing is foreclosed. Orientation is clear by line 10; transitions are smooth; no plot amnesia. Closure lands as Charged Poise, though the cost is more aesthetic than tactical, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: porcelain box opens → frozen sand falls → memory re-ordering → stance shift. Orientation anchors by word 60; no spatial drift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses self-punishment and accepts forest rhythm—with conceptual cost legible in the final “I hear you.” Persistent constraint is the hourglass itself, re-pricing time as cyclical rather than punitive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the gauge needle flips from altitude to “a coordinate only she could interpret,” reweighting the grotto from place to crossroads. Causal chain—patterns → air swirl → dimensional aperture—holds; each decorative act tightens options. Cost is conceptual (the vista of skies she can never fully reach) and is felt on the page in the final image. One minor scaffold: “across parallel timelines” is asserted twice before the reader sees any on-page divergence, but the pattern is taught by midpoint and pays off at exit, so no deduction touches the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the locket’s whisper “You are the map” reconfigures her role with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: diaries → recognition of shared dream → surrender of film → inheritance claimed. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The film-burn beat could carry sharper physical stakes, but the persistent constraint (she must become the map) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors reset yet the meadow-image proves the song worked, reweighting possibility with conceptual cost—the sister stays unreachable. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each mirror activation tightens the same stake rather than branching plot, satisfying the lens. The locket-heartbeat metronome is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics throughout. One causal gap: the bells’ interruption never threatens failure, so the final success feels pre-ordained rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage is loose—negotiations advance more by accretion than because/therefturns—but the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and honored: each stain/crease on the clipboard adds density until the final signature reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the signed treaty plus Elara shouldering the unspoken cost of vigilance. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. No meaningful reversal inside a single beat, yet the pattern of weary concessions narrows options credibly. Cost is felt in the final image—“weight…comfort”—and constrains next battlefield.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map yellows on his wall while thunder replays in memory, crystallizing that progress now carries the tax of permanent extinction—a conceptual cost legible without exposition. Causal chain holds: drought → egg theft → salt-flat ritual → resort plan, each “therefore” tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“edge of the salt flat … cracked earth beneath his boots”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (cracks/echoes accumulate weight) is taught early and reconfigured at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the dance progressively densifies light/echoes until the final prismatic cascade. Closure = Charged Poise: the harvested orbs swirl around her, re-weighting her stance with felt but unpaid social cost (she now carries disobedient voices). Orientation is nailed in paragraph-2; no因果 breaks. The slight lag is that the “threads” mechanics are metaphor-only, never tested against failure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed projection reweights the premise that “ethical” equals full exposure, and the cost is legible in the audience’s nervous laugh that becomes release. The single-scene orientation is firm by line 5; the causal lens (Situational) holds as the campfire stick’s glow forces stance crystallization. One micro-turn suffices; no teleport props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silken knot layers loss and reverence until the lattice becomes a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that accepts dissolution by morning. Orientation is immediate; the grotto anchors by word 30. Cost is visible—aching fingers, wind that will erase—but the monarch’s landing feels more serendipitous than causally earned; still, closure lands with felt fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because he threads the card into the rope, the braid reknits and summons Lira, foreclosing his exile in silence. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“icebound sanctum”) and the manuscript rule is taught early. The beam piercing the ceiling is a decisive change with visible cost—his shadow burned onto the wall—so closure lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm energy, seal heat, and dream fragments accrue until Mara’s stance crystallizes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she pockets the glowing seal and walks out—reweighting decay into generative soil with felt conceptual cost (“the bunker’s walls softening into soil”). Orientation is secured within 120 words; no causal breaks, though the hologram’s off-stage voice is lightly convenient. One minor ellipsis: how the seal physically projects a hologram is skipped, but the effect is pattern-consistent and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the tile becomes a mirror whose image (her face star-stitched) reweights every prior equation into covenant with the self; cost is felt because “the unknown wasn’t a void to fear—it was a dialogue” and she must now keep it open. Causal chain holds: frugality motivates the trip; tile discovery triggers wall-slide; tile-merge projects star-map; mirror forces stance crystallization. The palace’s past reuse (tomb, library, forge) is textured through cuneiform reliefs, not exposition dump, so orientation is complete before word 120. No lens ambiguity; the drive is situational—external pressure of ruins forces internal stance lock-in.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pin in Kael’s palm reweights all prior healings and the sanctuary’s silence snaps into the world’s hum—conceptual cost paid, lens held. Causality is tight: each healing beat is a therefore-link triggered by Lirael’s poured blood. Orientation perfect—velvet walls named by word 60. The only micro-drag is the penultimate paragraph’s explanatory lull (“Grace isn’t perfect…”) which briefly suspends pressure before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the reversed sextant and inward-pointing needle deliver a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise—navigation turns introspective—while the gift of the pocket mirror carries felt cost (Elias relinquishes his crafted boundary-tool). Causal chain holds: broken sextant → mutual repair → shared breath → path revealed → mirror gifted → inward turn. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One minor loop: “the fog thickening as twilight deepened” repeats the prior frost-fog image without new pressure. Lens is Causal and persists to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens: each weld of the quartz eye because/therefore blooms the orchard. Orientation lands by line 3; no drift. Closure is a quiet RR (Charged Poise): orchard renewed, ribbon pocketed, persistence crystallized. Cost is present yet conceptual (“no patrons, no gold”); a sharper material forfeiture would have lifted this above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each pistachio shell discovery tightens options—blank → portrait → map—because-therefore links push her toward the naming tree. The closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: pressing the cameo fuses her name into the tree, paying the price of lifelong exile from institutional legitimacy. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 50; no penalty. One minor causality bump: the grotto library vision is summoned without prior rule cue, but the pattern is paid off when the map appears on the shell, so the lapse stays sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the library opens only after Elara publicly confesses ignorance—an irreversible stance change with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: diary gaps → melody → orchid → velvet shelf → guardian concession → entry. Orientation anchored by line 3 inside the sentient bookstore; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: emerald card → hidden door → seed → ship vanishes. Orientation anchored by line 4; no debt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the meadow’s sunlit expanse reweights “unkindled solace” from hollow to fertile, cost paid by the erased ship. One tightening beat at the calliope key-press narrows options to descent; no outline drift. Persistent constraint: the card’s teeth marks keep earlier damage legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly under a Causal lens: the re-braided rope causes the door to open and the scroll’s discovery reweights her purpose. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; the single transition into the corridor is legible. Cost is present but thin—only the chill and sparks—so the cap stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she kneels, traces, presses, the bloom manifests and re-silences the caves. The spiral ice wall acts as persistent constraint; the final “quiet so profound it felt like drowning in velvet” is a Charged Poise that reweights all prior noise. Cost is legible in her aching ribs and creaking joints—visible price on the last page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s song reweights the premise—light is for memory, not navigation. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from hush to hum is legible and carries persistent cost (scarred hands, void scar remains).

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s continuing hum and her lighter steps reweight identity from archivist to living memory, cost felt in the evaporating puddles she’ll never record. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of solid fog → fractured sky → evaporating puddles escalates density and reweights stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, no penalty. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; shadow lengths obey internal logic. Minor loop: “the hush deepened” repeated twice in adjacent paragraphs (−0.2 in Q7); does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—ambient sensory filtration, mosaic note, knot flame—and each beat thickens density until the domed lilies detonate into a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “hopelessness” as fuel. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the tightening is legible: every filament of imagery loops back to charge the final golden bloom with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; closure lands on-page with visible flame and atmospheric shudder.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causality holds: pool → cicada → rotated cue → softened Kael. Orientation is clean by line 7; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a valid Charged Poise: the altered cicada position + rising tide reconfigure relational options with felt, if quiet, cost—she accepts the pause may last. The缺少 a decisive external trigger keeps it shy of 9.0, but the image lands.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout through the bunker floor reweights all prior silence-tasting into living growth, and the cost—permanent loss of the doll—remains visible in the empty hand. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tasting → planting tightens the dominant stake without need of causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no drift or disorientation. The final image’s conceptual cost (plant pushing through steel) is undeniable and legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the train-whistle echo → deepening quiet → vial stillness forms a coherent cadence shift that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the quiet had always been waiting” crystallizes options without soft reset. Cost is conceptual—she will guide others through silence—yet lacks a tangible, foregone sacrifice, keeping it just shy of 9-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: shard-in-wall triggers stair, mural sequence maps path, question disarms guardian; closure (CR) reweights throne as mirror with visible cost—stair collapses, legacy claimed by standing, not sitting. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure is cleanly landed via Earned Stasis: Elara’s encroachment re-opens the threshold, foreclosing her zero-contact rule with felt cost (“sanctuary shuddered”). Causal chain is lean—knock summons Kael, reunion stresses the sanctuary—but causality holds. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives before 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The doorknocker’s prior set-up behind a loose stone keeps the conduit rule consistent and pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: glitch texts → bolt → diamonds destabilize → Mara turns bolt → farm saved; the porthole bolt re-enters to trigger closure with visible cost (“edges now smooth from her touch”). Orientation is clean within 120 words; minor slack in how “conceptual pressure” maps to physical stakes keeps it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The standing-wave mechanic is causal and well-foreshadowed; the gramophone frequency literally unlocks the desk, giving a concrete Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the dynasty ends by choice, not blood. Orientation is swift (“sepia reading room… first yawn of evening”) and the lens (Causal) holds cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the greenhouse dissolves and Cedric re-enters dawn unarmored, program blank—undeniable cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent: each snapped string tightens the pattern until reality reconfigures. Orientation is swift; the single transition (stage → spiral) is legible. No plot amnesia; the alchemist’s dying line seeds the final pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the button re-weights emancipation’s promise for the nameless, charging Elias’s new folder with felt social cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—dust circles and grime patterns tighten meaning—but the causality of “eight-years-later button → must write” is asserted, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal linkage holds: key → tunnel → terminal → explosion. Orientation is clean by word 90; the puddle-map beat is seeded early and repaid at entry. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the relay blown up is a cost, yet the emotional price is under-projected—the final smile asserts rather than dramatizes the reconfigured stance, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the prophecy’s completion at measurable physical cost (burnt lungs, cold brass, dissipated figure). Causal chain holds: because he plays the negative space, the code frays; therefore the specter collapses. Orientation anchored by word 40. Lens-stable accumulative/textural; color-cadence deepens to white-hot then fade. One micro-turn: specter’s approach tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: dust-speck → monuments → legible leaves → triad of actions; each beat tightens options under an accreting pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elinor’s new charge to warn and seek Lirael—paid for by dissolving dust and the hush lifting; cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. Minor softness: storm/silverseed warning arrives as external gift rather than deduction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spinning compass reweights the whole premise, cost is felt in the laugh that admits futility. Causal chain is tight: storm → hatch → shaft → plunge → compass; each step shrinks options. One transition (surface→cave) is cleanly marked. Orientation is solid by 80 words. The admiral’s journal line acts as off-page propellant—never shown in scene—so motive aperture is a hair wider than publish-now perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: coin → pit → vortex → apparition → renunciation. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—Lira’s “I shed my name” reweights Kael’s quest and costs him certainty. One micro-drag: “after the search party disbands” is told late; anchoring this sooner would sharpen stakes earlier, but it still serves the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tooth’s new pulse and the warm diffusion of laughter re-weight healing from destination to pursuit, with undeniable felt cost. Causal chain holds—because she admits fear, the keeper yields, therefore the harp dissolves and the laughter transfers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Echo Gorge”), lens stable throughout. The keeper’s vanish is mildly convenient, but the protagonist’s volitional offer of the tooth keeps agency intact. Cost is visible in the relic’s glow and her lighter heart—meets 9- gate but shaved −0.6 for slight over-expository veiled-truth dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forest dims, strap still in hand, mathematics of mercy now an open question—conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds: UV pattern intensifies → spore snow → fractal glow reweights survival stake without causal reversals. Orientation clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Slight over-reliance on environment to deliver the final shift rather than a new micro-decision keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lattice is tight: ink → hyper-vision → mural crack → breath-to-wave alignment → shard release. Each step is irreversible; failure would mean no fragment, no second chance for the drowned world. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “anchors of intuition are for letting go” re-weights the whole market quest; the price is the pierced palm and the relinquished shard. No orientation drift—who/where/when anchored by third line; transitions are one mist staircase, one ink swallow, one mural touch—clean.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, cracks, and flickering lights thicken until the ceiling compartment reveal reweights the stakes. Orientation is anchored by 120 words via ticket counter, elevator shaft, fluorescent death. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when plaster gives way and hidden papers emerge, tightening knowledge. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias chooses to “repair the stories,” not just the elevator, with visible cost signaled by shaking legs and the ghost’s cold touch; lens stays coherent, no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the library’s order is revealed as cage, the whisper as key, with the new spiral waiting—cost is legible in the airborne glass and the patrons’ terror-wonder. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: frost pattern → press rhythm → rupture → awakening, each beat tightening density. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity. One soft spot: the actual rupture beat is summarized in two sentences, slightly blunting the decisive change’s visceral snap.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing fungi re-weight history and expose the Council’s lie with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage between mirror-draping and the storm-vision is poetic logic rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and payoff is on the page. Orientation is swift—“who, where, when” anchored within 60 words. One soft spot: the fungi bloom feels slightly convenient—Kael “planted seeds” off-page, so the physical mechanism of victory is only retroactively asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lullaby is not restored but re-defined as “truth,” reweighting the covenant’s rule-set with undeniable moral cost. Causal chain holds: because Lira confesses, the stone flares → Elias can tether → the melody re-tunes. Orientation is clean by word 80; chamber, dais, and toolkit are spatially tracked. One soft spot: the exact moment the confession “infects” the mechanism is off-page, but the flare immediately signals the linkage, so the causality beat is only thinned, not broken.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain: compass → fissure → lagoon → psychometry flash → sampling decision. Each step because/therefore narrows her options until the dropped compass and rippling water crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts unknowing and seals the cost in jars. Orientation (who/where) anchored by 90 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat lands with visible forfeiture of certainty and tactile jars as price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Charged Poise in the turbine-hum smile re-weights the premise—she is now timeline-weaver, art = map. Causal chain: slide-touch → portal-cross → ancestral gift → perceptual shift; each step depends on the last, no lucky rescue. Orientation fixed by word 60; one soft reset (storm still howls) is acknowledged, not hidden. Cost is conceptual (island complexity internalized) rather than visceral, sufficient for 8.2 but not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: light-shifts and glass layers accrue meaning until Mara’s final inversion of flower→shadow reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (amber pavilion, autumn, postcard cache). Closure is a Charged Poise: “the window’s final layer remained etched but unbroken” crystallizes options and cost without solving the puzzle. The persistent constraint—glass that hums, bruises, and withholds—shapes every tactics and the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: letters → diary → lagoon → parley → tunnel collapse forecloses codex retrieval. Closure is a Charged Poise: blank diary + Mara’s tear-streaked face reweights “truth” as ongoing struggle. Cost is legible in the empty pages and Joran’s dawn rope, proving price was paid. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cove’s lanterns brighten, ghosts become living images, and the seamless bottle is re-read as lens, all on-page with visible conceptual cost—Elias’s hollowed solitude is accepted, not cured. Causal chain holds: because he mines memory, therefore the town re-animates; no off-stage wish or coincidence resolves the revival. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 120 words by apothecary dust and salt-laden air. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the brightening cadence and pattern break land the tightening required for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the replayed wax pattern intensifies meaning rather than changing external options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the leaves will scream” reweights the silence—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on Voss. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the third-grade flashback cue is concrete and pays off. One scaffold loop: “the garden seemed to hold its breath” repeats the prior “garden filled with the ghost” cadence without new charge.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: frayed rope → glue stiffening → muted test → secondary rope → new tone → agitates storms → rhythmic duet → clouds calm. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell hangs silent but the solstice hush is now “forged,” a visible reconfiguration with felt atmospheric cost. Orientation arrives by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (rope timbre rules the sky) shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens: the repeated motif of “listening to silence” accretes until the lantern’s dimmed glow + captured stardust reweights the premise—science versus spirit—into a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric, not plot-driven, and the final image lands the RR cleanly under the Accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accretive/lyric lens holds: each return to the glass box tightens the pattern until the “Speak” pulse breaks it, delivering a Charged Poise that reweights silence vs. speech. Orientation anchored by word 80. Causality is soft—why today does the box glow?—but the coincidence is complication, not resolution, so allowed under lyric logic. Cost is palpable: the shattering scatters both artifact and ghosts, foreclosing retreat to muteness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mercury sphere and wife’s flicker reweight Elias’s ledger-obsessed world, costing him his former metric of time. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each described object thickens the “decay of moments” until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (emerald silo / twilight) and the capsule’s location is foreshadowed via architect’s notes, so no penalty. One minor causality wobble: the urn fragment’s sudden stilling of mercury feels like late-rule magic rather than seeded physics, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each gathered fragment and song-breath layers density until the tapestry’s fragile coherence becomes the Resonant Reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure—the feather pulsing with lagoon light—lands as Charged Poise with felt cost: tomorrow’s inevitable unraveling. One minor scaffold: “the act of creation mattered more than its permanence” paraphrases the prior paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is cleanly legible: the orchard’s pulse syncs, the spirit accepts coexistence, and Lira’s death pays the price—Conceptual Repricing achieved. Causality holds: each copper wrap tightens the bridge premise; the rumble signals resistance; the final wrap triggers acceptance. The six-month clock is stated but never tightens tactics on-page; time remains ambient rather than causal, a missed lever for escalation. Still, the lens (Hybrid, sliding to Accumulative) holds through the resonant final image of “a sigh, soft as copper on oak,” reweighting the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final “door creaked open” reweights the premise with conceptual cost (synthetic homecoming may be real). Causality holds under Hybrid lens—amber act triggers inversion, Kael’s mirror speech explains reframe—but orientation wavers: footprints vanish at sculpture #7 with no spatial cue that Lirael has reached the tower threshold, forcing reader to re-anchor. One non-closure flaw only: amber’s “resonance field” rule is introduced at the 80 % mark, a late mechanism that solves the mystery it did not help create (−0.7).

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seed, ash, bird-call builds to Charged Poise closure—flowers ‘flickering like tiny flames’ re-weight ‘submerged concord’. Orientation clean by 70 words; transitions not needed in single-scene design. Cost is conceptual: battlefield becomes garden, but emotional price remains oblique—hence not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the preserved leaf becomes communal icon, reweighting “distance into closeness.” Causality, however, is loose—each riddle is solved by authorial fiat (“Intuitively, she knew…”) rather than because/therefore links that foreclose wrong answers. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (dog-as-reader) is the gimmick and does pay off. Still, the cost is communal, not personal; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and that pattern holds without contradiction, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral corridor, warming compass, and deliberate step reconfigure “true north” from fixed bearing to motion itself—felt cost is the surrender of certainty. Causal chain holds: dilation glitch → grandmother coordinate → compass re-alignment → Elio’s choice to walk. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. One shard, single POV, within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is clean: wrong sky → ritual swap → sky healed. Orientation lands by word 60; no head-count or geography drift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the swapped silence vial reweights the premise—but the cost is abstract (no personal loss or lingering constraint), so the Decisive Change feels weightless. Lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each “unbind” lap tightens acoustic feedback → king topples → board reconfigures, yielding a clear Decisive Change. Orientation is swift (gallery, night, alone) and cost is legible—“she left with the board” seals her new historian role. Minor slack: why the interregnum loosens rules is unexplained, but the payoff justifies the ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is cleanly Earned Stasis: Lirael’s deliberate acceptance of stone shards forecloses escape from others’ memories and re-configures what “home” means. Causal chain holds: feather → stone crack → memory flood → choice to bear them. One smooth time-jump (attic cavern) is taught by the stone portal and pays off immediately. No props vanish; geography of mountain/bookstore stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven hush physically wraps Alaric, re-pricing his guilt as a thread to be rewoven, not severed. The cost is unmistakable—he forecloses perpetual penance and chooses renewed vocation—crystallized in the final image of the ring-twist shifting from anxiety to anticipation. Causal lens holds throughout: each labyrinth step is a because/therefore consequence of thread-plucking. Accumulation caps do not apply; no orientation debt; no late-rule insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon’s refracted light reweights the elders’ rule-set with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—poem → glow → crowd awe—though the elders’ instantaneous collapse is slightly convenient. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the lens (Causal) stays intact to the final image. Cost is legible in the new rhythm of echoes, even if Kael’s personal price stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s respirator removal crystallizes a Charged Poise—she survives by accepting imperfection, cost felt in burning lungs. Causal chain holds: charm-match → map → self-repair. Orientation is swift: acid sea, copper hull, pockmarked statue within 50 words. One micro-turn—charm is promise, not key—tightens stakes without breaking lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sketch placed beside the pool reframes his lifelong project and forecloses the old “harbor-as-it-is” rule; the cost is the unspoken vow to paint what can’t be held. Causality is accumulative/textural—each sensory layer (cracked mirror, shell’s heft, warm water reflection) tightens the stake until the final cadence shift. The wrong-turn catalyst is cleanly motivated by the mirror omen and mother memory, so the oasis arrival feels inevitable in hindsight. One minor slack: the fork choice (“he chose the left path, his intuition humming”) is unpressured and could have carried a visible risk to sharpen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the cork’s steady glow re-weights the premise—whispers can travel—while rain and tears make the cost visceral. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (scent, salt, hum) tightens the texture until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3). The only hairline slip is the off-stage village reaction; because it is the proof Elara seeks, its summary rather than scene slightly dulls the conceptual cost, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: dead beacons → phone call → build ritual → spinning foot → chorus of voices, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning censer foot and audible chant reweight meaning, foreclosing isolation with undeniable cost—the station may shake apart. Cost is visible: Mara’s sweat, solder burns, hair given. One micro-turn—moonlit noon signal—qualifies as legitimate escalation. Lens ambiguity zero; pattern taught early and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as a declared intention (“We occlude”) rather than a Decisive Change on the page; the ledger is revealed but nothing is done with it, so cost is conceptual not felt. Causal chain is clear because/therefore across storm → eye → truth-spill → shelter, but the final beat merely reconfigures rhetoric, not reality. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly inside 120 words. One micro-turn: eye insertion forces Jorn’s unfiltered confession; this tightens options and sets up the ending, satisfying single-scene arc.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: Elias places the Edelweiss on the trunk, foreclosing his lifelong isolationist stance while accepting the freight of others’ pain. Causal lattice holds: boutonnière → hatch → journal → renunciation, each because/therefore link tightening options. Lens is causal throughout; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Cost is legible in the final line—“a child’s laughter waited to be reclaimed”—a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior gap he has observed.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: map → ants → chip → doorway → mirroring choice. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden vision re-weights “home” and the chip becomes a pocketed talisman of self-charting. Cost is visible in the final image—she smiles at dusty shelves that now feel chosen, not escaped.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal spine holds: dream → climb → grotto → mirror-speech → descent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she descends still bleeding, starlight on her hands, options re-weighted. Cost is conceptual but legible—the wound is now acknowledged—yet the beat is narrated rather than dramatized; the queen does not speak or act to seal the change, slightly blunting the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each sun-engine failure → recalibration → ledger find → shell reposition → resonance. The decisive change lands when she lets the shell guide the engine; cost is the prior three explosions and the audible hum that could still detonate. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure reconfigures her methodology, not just the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank scroll fills with words not from Elias’s pen, reweighting the premise that the past is fixed; the cost is the loss of authorial control over his own narrative. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (grave, scroll, ledge) adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the grave date anchors time, the cabin anchors space. Causality is loose but coherent under the dream-logic pattern taught early; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the polished screw returned with the note reweights Mrs. Voss’s guilt into grace, and the cost—Lira’s irreversible sensory exile—remains palpable in the final chime. Causal chain is clean: engraving → photo → letter → delivery; no orientation debt; one smooth shard.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: obsidian cups → quill → ink trail → crystallization → portal, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mist-path opening reweights every prior failure into legible language. Cost is felt—the platform shudders, bones mist, mentor’s quill is now freighted with future debts—so 9+ gate cleared. Orientation is complete well before 120 words; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Elias lied to lure her, Clara brings the bottle; because copper conducts, the drop channels Lila’s resonance; because the song finishes, the orchard falls—tight because/therefore chain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty bottle and the roaring saws reweight the entire premise—miracles are imperfect and bought with real noise. Cost is legible in the final two sentences: dove still, chainsaws alive—silence traded for mechanized loss. No因果 breaks; orientation anchored by word 50; one transition (shadow→piano) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure earns its keep: the dictionary empties itself—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost under an Accumulative lens. Structure is mosaic-lite: corridor vignettes accumulate texture toward that final reweighting. Causality is loose (“because/therefore” largely poetic), but the pattern is taught early and paid off, satisfying Accumulative rules. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; no teleporting props; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: the backwards count tightens pattern until the fjord-clock surfaces and reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 5; causality is not the engine, but the cadence shift from 100→1 delivers the required tightening. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—time reframed as longing—with the key’s razor edge still in pocket as persistent constraint. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal lens holds: laser frequency → barrier shift → column softening → farm re-permeabilized. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved barrier reweights the security paradigm with visible ecological upside. However, the “dying heart” stakes are declared late and the price (what exactly is lost?) is only gestured at, keeping cost just legible but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens dominates: each subway clue → library chalk → lantern-lit choice → left-track fork → return with stance shift. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “mirrors” line reweights chaos from trap to reflective tool, tear-and-rain image makes cost legible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. The single causal ellipsis—how the car returns her to the stacks—is allowed under motivated ellipsis that tightens options rather than breaks them.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mosaic of calls follows an accumulative design: each vignette layers the glass disc’s reverb until the final lullaby image re-weights loneliness into communion—Charged Poise achieved. Transitions are clean (“By dawn…”) and orientation is fixed inside the first 60 words, satisfying the Orientation Test. Causality is thematic rather than plot-level; disc-spin summons emotional alignment, not literal plot pivot, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the jetty’s sighing flowers reconfigure the covenant as an ongoing act of attention, with felt cost in her ink-stained hands; causal chain is thin—why tonight’s ritual matters now is asserted, not shown—but the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: rumor → moon rock → ghost negotiation → release of loneliness. Orientation is swift—who/where/when anchored within 80 words. Closure is Charged Poise: the conductor’s dictum “loneliness is the space between” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost rather than tidy victory. The missing beat is an on-page price exacted from Elias; because none is shown, the turn feels light even though the lens is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: mother-as-memory reconfigures grief into sightless “seeing,” cost felt in the ring’s final throb. Causal linkage holds: each ultrasonic cue → ring translation → physical act; no gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“edge of the Whispering Glade”). Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mosaic shard structure is taught early (anomaly→Lira arrival→farmer house) and causality holds: wrong edit → blight → crater confrontation → surrender of authorial control. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “editing…was about turning mistakes into seeds,” with social cost (he must face the family without a tidy fix). One transition, no orientation debt; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael’s dawn solitude crystallizes the price—tonight’s communion will vanish with the tide, and he knows it. Each beat obeys Accumulative linkage: silence → mapping → violin → collective awe → morning erasure, tightening the stake of being forgotten. Camera-to-heart sign at end reweights the premise: filmless capture outlives film. Orientation, lens, and cost are unmistakable on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the healed portrait reconfigures the archive from tomb to living garden, with the tear’s ink as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each painted glyph layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by 80 words; the single mosaic shard (three-day ellipsis) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the joint drumming accepts perpetual entanglement with the lagoon, a resonant image that reweights earlier sorrow. However, the climactic “shock of warmth” is the first on-page cost we actually feel; earlier stakes (the promised cure, the rebellion) are declared but never tested or lost, so the price arrives late and light. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—vibrational density increases toward the drum circle—but the middle sags with repeated wonder-statements rather than tightening options. Orientation is clear by line 30; no penalties, yet the escalation never forecloses a live alternative, keeping tension abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: coin→Libra symbol→key→hidden staircase→glowing map proves the labyrinth watches, re-weighting Elias’s prior whisper-theory with conceptual cost. The 698-word single-scene arc is cleanly oriented by ~120 words (container row, storm, challenge), one transition (descend/return), and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—his quiet “Not long enough” crystallizes a new stance. Minor stutter: the brass key appears with zero prior cue or failed attempt, so the lock-less logic feels providential, not earned. Closure is intact, lens is Causal, cost legible in the humbled haulers and Elias’s refusal to shout directions.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last image of lingering patterns visibly reweights the premise—darkness has momentarily learned stars—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: because she refracts light, the canal’s whispers soften; cost is the acceptance of endless return (“her work would never truly be finished”) stated on page. Orientation is anchored within first 60 words, no set-up teleports. No meaningful lens ambiguity; pattern of light-weave taught early and paid off at end.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causality holds: runaway pawn → grotto discovery → night play → dawn covenant. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive within 120 words and are never lost. Closure uses Charged Poise: “let’s keep planting” crystallizes options with felt cost (night-long play, Lila’s first spoken words). Persistent constraint—magnetic grotto as amplifier of silence—shapes every tactical move; no contradiction under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she keeps the scrimshaw, the whale summons her; because she releases it, the island dissolves. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure is a decisive CR: the island’s dissolution reprices “home” and the scrimshaw’s vanishing light pays the cost. One soft spot: the whale’s eye-to-eye “surge of recognition” is slightly abstract, keeping this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: each shaving of wood thickens the emotional density until the polished spoon reweights the mandate’s rule-set. Closure is a Charged Poise—she forecloses surrender by vowing tomorrow’s spoon, cost legible in the crumbling petal stain on her finger. No因果 breaks; turbine hum and knife grit tighten the same cord.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Lirael stands on liquid glass, the world “ours to reshape,” cost hinted but not felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of crystals, quartz song, lake breathing—yet the decisive intensification (stepping onto water) is gifted by the setting, not driven by prior paraphrase failures or sacrifices. Orientation clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. However, the absence of a visible price at the final beat keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky-painted fractals reweight beauty’s locus from perfection to cracked glass, with felt social spectacle cost as tourists gawk. Causal chain is mostly accumulative: dust → mural blooms → reed tongue heats → secret revealed; because/therefore links are soft—Elias does not actively test the mural, he “discovers” it. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; one meaningful tightening (dust ignition) is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lab falls silent, mountain song ascends, reconfiguring the premise with conceptual cost—human devices cede to older voices. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each beat layers texture until the pattern breaks in the final hush. The pilgrimage generates tightening, not reversal, satisfying the short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dome becomes a “beacon” refracting grief into guidance, cost legible in “his fingers bled.” Causality is accumulative/textural; each lantern adds density rather than narrows options. The origami drop is off-stage, weakening the because/therefore chain—readers must take on faith that strangers will follow coordinates. Orientation is fine; stakes declared early but never tested on-page after the first crane.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece lands a clean Conceptual Repricing closure: the final image of the loft listening while Elara lays new cards reweights the premise—culture’s skeleton is now usable blueprint, not ruin. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each card/tape juxtaposition adds pattern density until the “scars can be maps” reconfiguration feels earned. Orientation is swift—skylight loft, rain, night—well within 120 words. The only micro-slip is a late, slightly abstract declaration (“This is how we rebuild”) that could have carried a concrete forfeiture; still, the reconfiguration is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: Lirael’s renunciation of innocence reweights the premise—she steps into the unknown with the gold light still clinging to her, a Charged Poise that forecloses retreat. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each swirl of nostalgic dust intensifies the archive’s refusal to be tamed, culminating in the pagoda’s hum. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“bronze prism pagoda at twilight”). One pressure drop: Kael’s exit is unmotivated, a soft teleport that momentarily thins causality but does not break the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: stone’s pulse → footage comparison → spiral recognition → utter “Bloom” → shadow reconfigures. Orientation is swift, the library/cloud dome anchors space by ~70 words, and the 1987 footage supplies a clean before/after hinge. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the shelves rewrite themselves—whose cost is felt as the shadow’s dissolution, satisfying the 9- gate for form even if the price could be sharper on Lirael personally.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory detail thickens the stake of “soft v. hard” until the rebuilt tail reframes survival. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“workshop’s rafters,” “Lira,” “after the con”). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the iridescent tail held to dawn—repricing softness as viable armor; cost is felt in the quiet smile after a sleepless night. No causal break; one meaningful tightening when she sees the tail as “map,” foreclosing retreat to cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: hourglass frost → tunnel → visions → shatter → epiphany. Orientation clear by word 60. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scar’s meaning reconfigured, cost implied in “no longer pain but connection.” However, the tunnel’s rules (coffee rings = memory portals) are asserted, not constrained; no limit or price attaches to Mara’s descent, softening the miracle’s displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly with a Charged Poise: the booth’s lilac-tinged air reweights the premise, making Mara’s custodianship feel irreversible and socially costly. Orientation is swift—by line 3 we have who, where, stakes—so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, pattern held throughout. Causality is mostly tight, yet the script’s leap from ‘47 dance to farewell letters is a convenient film-edit rather than an on-page choice that tightens options for Mara; this faintly softens the climax. The persistent constraint (she physically pockets the strip) shapes future tactics and satisfies 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky dissolves into his personal constellation map and his creativity is unblocked. The cost is the solitude he accepts at dawn, but it is only implicit; no tangible thing is forfeited on the page. Causality is accumulative/lyric: each image layers density until the chamber reveals the jars. The “voice” that guides him is off-stage exposition; because/therefore links are weak, so the lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands: the ticking clock and newborn sparks give a legible Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the archive’s survival now depends on a formerly dreamless guard. Causality is thin: “become occasionally everywhere” is asserted, not linked to prior freight-guard skills or constraints. Orientation is waived; the lyric disorientation pays off in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael twists the hands, but the middle lacks intermediate beats that narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear-seed drifts away and the forest’s “hum” softens, reweighting the premise toward coexistence. Causal chain is thin—gear insertion instantly triggers revelation and paternal hologram—but the Accumulative/Textural pattern (repetition of wind-song motifs) holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch left on stone crystallizes the vigil’s endless循环 with felt cost—no destination, only return. Accumulative lens holds: the repeated stamping, vanishing paths, and ticket litter build density until the final image reweights “courage” as river, not lake. Orientation is clear by 120 words; ridgeway rules are taught through action. The only causal gap: why the first leash break authorizes the vigil is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: missed bolt → scream → silence ruptures → Elric speaks. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the piano’s pure note reweights the pact, cost felt in the audible shift from void to music. The stain-as-map moment is slightly convenient; the fortress pact logic is told more than dramatized, nudging the turn toward allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: pellet → mosaic door → crown sundered → illusion collapses; the missing-map piece tightens options and the final image reweights the realm’s truth with visible cost. One micro-turn—pellet strike—delivers the Decisive Change demanded by the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the couple sails off, the station empty, the paths re-light behind them—an image that reweights the premise (the ocean is rewriting itself). Causality holds: atlas → plankton coordinates → decision to follow. Orientation is clear by line 6 (“edge of the atoll”). The “periodically eternal” rule is announced late yet pays off in the final reappearance of the paths, so the latent ambiguity is forgiven. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; because no body, tool, or relationship price is dramatized, the piece can’t breach 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stones’ flare reconfigures the rebellion’s meaning and the crowd’s roar makes the cost audible. Causal chain—opera glasses reveal symbols → alignment window → hum peaks → collective ignition—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only drag is a mild soft-reset: the physical price (Lira’s bare feet, Jax’s risk) is implied, not foregrounded, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: kite script → plant whispers → dig → hatch → embryo → plant it. Each step shrinks options and raises cost. The hatch opening on the first try is a touch convenient, but the price—blistered hands, drone risk, irreversible release of destiny—keeps the turn earned. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing amber sphere in the bubbling spring reweights all prior talk of tradition vs. evolution into a living future whose price is still unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photo tuck-back crystallizes a before/after stance with felt cost. Causal linkage is sound—each return to the bench tightens the stake in stillness—yet the lighthouse keeper backstory is ornamental, never constraining tactics. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The ending would gain finality if the persistent constraint (wind? salt decay?) shadowed the last image; as is, cost is emotional, not environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the threads pulse, portrait breathes, lighthouse sighs—undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the premise from “fragments are lies” to “fragments can be rewoven.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated image-pattern (thread, card, lens-less tower) intensifies until the cadence shift at the top of the stairs crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: each collage act (tearing card, ink from crushed tarot, thread bridge) is because/therefore linked to rising claustrophobia. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (lamp, salt-rot, tarot box), no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ink reveals the tower door, crystallizing a Charged Poise—she steps into the unknown with her brother’s memory as unavoidable cost. Causal chain is thin (ink → map → door) yet coherent under a lyrical lens; the disappearing ink rule is taught early and paid off at the end. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No meaningful tightening inside the scene; escalation is imagistic rather than tactical, acceptable for Accumulative/Textural mode. Meets short-form scope: single POV, one scene, <800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain—letter → awaken Kael → truth escapes—holds and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of two silhouettes in the snow-lit archive crystallizes options with undeniable social cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single transition (chamber opening) is legible; escalation tightens once when Lirael sacrifices her safe archivist role, but the Council threat is still abstract, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure image—burying the scrap while humming—delivers a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “quiet” from slogan to seed, satisfying the lens. Causality is thin: the decision to plant the scrap is not opposed or complicated, merely arrived at via reflection, so the beat feels foregone. Orientation is swift and the single-scene default is met; no structural violations, but the lack of friction keeps the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the goddess becomes substrate, constellations snap to order, and the garden’s hum is now feral-lullaby memory—cost is legible in the soil’s shimmer. Causal chain holds: spike strikes → frequency harmonizes → goddess revealed → she willingly diffuses. Orientation is swift; “sound-wave garden” and “rail spike” anchor by line 3. One meaningful tightening only, but it reweights the sky itself, satisfying the single-scene lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain: midnight call → discovery of annotated memo → journalist hand-off → public exposure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dome’s sunrise image recasts her lifelong star-mapping as evidence against, not for, the family. Cost is legible—the nib wound, ostracized mother, dismantled fortune. Single transition (night→dawn) is clean; orientation anchors within first 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure earns Charged Poise: the amber dims, lab silenced, firmware rewritten—cost is the erased dissonance itself. Causal chain holds: amber pulse → letters → code rewrite → silence, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the corridor nursery appears without grounding transition, a momentary teleport, but it pays off thematically so orientation debt is waived. Final image is legible under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the holographic reveal reweights the grotto from “silent refuge” to “living language,” and the cost is the irrevocable shift in Mara’s stance—she can no longer merely document. Causal lens holds: drawing → tile response → mandala key → wall slot → silence breathes → ceiling vortex, each step because/therefore. Orientation is crisp by line 8; no lens ambiguity at end. Accumulation cap: −0.3 for a single soft reset—whispers “cease abruptly” without showing Mara’s moment of fear, slightly dampening cost visibility. Still, the final image of her drawing on the wall carries undeniable charge.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-set tessera re-weights the plaza from ruin to rebirth, visible in the final line “renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens is taught early and held. Cost is conceptual—he accepts that memory cannot prevent fire, only transform its aftermath—satisfying the 9+ quick test even though the price is oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—echoes layering into chorus—and holds it to closure. Orientation is swift: ghost, orchard, coin, post-closing hour all land inside 60 words. The tarot coin’s blanking at dawn supplies a visible Conceptual Repricing: the Fool’s journey erased by collective possibility, felt cost encoded in “weight.” One minor lapse: the maze’s dissolution is announced rather than embodied, blurring spatial causality a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal spine intact: because the shock tagged neural pathways, Elias therefore maps them; because pills bulldoze, he refuses recall refunds. Orientation anchored by word 50; studio geography remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: geode flare aligns breadcrumbs, foreclosing pill option. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sketchbook of “intertwined light and bone” reweights stakes with visible tool-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the leaf’s dissolution reweights Lira’s vocation and the world’s memory economy. Causality is sound—each mapper reading drives the next—but the “because” hinge between golden spores entering her skin and her instant vocational rebirth is slightly under-motivated. Accumulation lens holds; the tightening beat is the gold spore uptake that forecloses mere cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s echo reweights prophecy into possibility, felt in the surging chorus. Causality holds—button-sorting ritual → deciphered message → stance shift—but the middle beat is summary, not scene. Accumulation lens is cleanly held; one micro-deepening is enough.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: dream prompt → pillbox coordinates → bluff transcription → resolve to seek truth. Closure is Charged Poise—“she walked in the silver hush, her steps lighter”—reconfiguring options with felt cost (she has burned anonymity to leave the message). Orientation is clear by line 15; only minor scaffold in the “three weeks earlier” flash frame.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: fog, needle, ferry layer density toward a palimpsest closure. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—Thaddeus sees the ticking gutters and “carries his layer forward”—but the cost is conceptual only; no tactic or option visibly narrows. Pattern is coherent yet static, not causally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sunlight skips, glass thrums, sunflowers endure—pattern intensification rather than causal chain. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s pulse reweights the premise (“small acts of care could bend reality”) with conceptual cost foreshadowed by the “stubborn hive of memory.” One shard, no orientation debt; the skip-stones sunlight teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story lands a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s window opens, moonlight floods in, and the harbor acquires a shared heartbeat. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each beat of the gauge on wood intensifies texture rather than narrowing options, but the final image reweights the stake—light is now mutual, not solitary. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words and hold. Closure cost is conceptual yet legible: Elias relinquishes his private talisman, and Mara risks reopening to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images, tides, and hum thicken until the sundial’s brass surface reweights the stake from nostalgia to authorship. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral symbol re-prices isolation as creative agency. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Lirael stood beside a brass sundial”). No causality breaks; each beat adds density rather than causal reversal, coherent with chosen lens. Cost is felt in the final image—her “steadying but wavering” reflection—undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sinking orb reweights her prior hidden life with undeniable social cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—touch spiral → memory → orb act → song—but the decisive beat is compressed into one sentence of resolve, so the cost is felt more than visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: anomaly → funding threat → subsonic gambit → starlight truce, each beat shrinking options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she tapes the singed chart up, a visible price and open invitation to round two—so the lens stays causal with cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: compass misbehavior → organ summons → corridor mutiny → key retrieval, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: cathedral dissolves, gateway opens, cost felt in recrudescent claustrophobia and key’s pulse. Orientation anchored by 120 words; spatial choreography survives the rubber-wall sequence. One causality micro-gap: the organ’s mechanics are never motivated or constrained, so the summon reads as convenient miracle rather than earned rule.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist, ribbon, locket, and handprint layer into a density shift that reweights the stakes from cold case data to embodied empathy. The pattern is taught early (ribbon fused into stone cracks) and culminates in the framed pairing of ribbon + portrait—a Charged Poise that lets the reader feel the reopened case’s social cost without exposition. One micro-turn (handprint reveals pushed vs. jumped) tightens options; causality is coherent though secondary to accrual of sensory evidence. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure; cost is legible in the final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each discovery (nail → coded stanza → buried journal → rooftop recital) tightens options under a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green sky and humming instruments reweight the premise—exile can be questioned, not simply endured. Cost is visible in the warming nail and the station lights flickering, foreshadowing physical peril she chooses to brave. No causality breaks; even the jet-stream shift is foreshadowed as anomaly, not deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flake clears, time folds, options reconfigure, and the bridge-song reboot feels irrevocable. Causal linkage along an Accumulative/Textural track (pixel pattern → scaffold flutters → music warp) holds; flake discovery and musical ignition provide the necessary tightening. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty. The cost—destabilized reality, exile from prior timeline—remains conceptual; slightly soft because not viscerally anchored in body or prop irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: because he inherits guilt, therefore he weaponizes symbolic currency; because markers unsettle Marcus, therefore the startup unravels. Closure—Elias at peace inside the train—lands as Charged Poise: options reframed, cost felt through the bills-turned-talisman. One soft spot: the off-stage collapse of the startup is relayed in compressed retrospective, muting the decisive consequences. Still, the lens stays coherent and the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: telegram → prism → temple hologram → acceptance → wall etching; each beat narrows options under the chosen lens. Closure lands on-page—“a lullaby in her brother’s handwriting”—with felt cost; the prism’s constraint shapes every tactical move. Micro-turn at the hologram floor perfectly tightens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex stills, the seed dims, and Mira lifts a now-inert reminder of the cost she’s willing to carry—an image that reweights her self-concept. Causal chain holds: failed ritual → enters vortex → seed retrieves memory → she breathes spores → orchard quiets. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the two-moon sky reweights the covenant with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds: clipping-scar link → labyrinth reappearance → merger. Orientation clean by 120 words. Yet the decisive change is voiced by the double, not enacted by Lirael, softening the felt cost. Still, the image reconfigures stakes, satisfying the 9+ quick test borderline.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Lirael emerging into amber-violet light crystallizes a before/after—ash becomes growth—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The orchard’s pattern (trade → stitch → eat) is taught early and tightens once through the act of sewing, reweighting the stake from “patch holes” to “carry orchard inside.” Cost is legible in the bitter-sweet fruit and the visible shimmer of patched cracks. Causality holds: because she gives the Fool card, therefore she receives the fruit that reframes her reckless idealism as generative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain intact: botched TV → quarry exile → cloth discovery → Google ID → call bassist → purpose pivot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trailer office suddenly reweighs as archive, not exile, felt in the cloth against his heart. Cost is understated but legible: he must keep living the quarry life while newly accountable to vanished music.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: seed → chant → light → bloom → root-shift; each step is legible and reversible only with violence to logic. Closure is a Charged Poise: the arbor’s “new song” reconfigures Elara’s goal from “solve transition” to “tend transition,” with the conceptual cost of perpetual unknowability made palpable in the final heartbeat image. Orientation, lens, and cost all stay on-page; only a mild slackening in mid-text temporal tracking keeps it from the 9-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather in the chestplate reweights the premise—wonder is recycled, not consumed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each trinket adds density until the final image crystallizes the loop. Orientation is swift; the melted-clock datum anchors us by line 3. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric-repetition pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of crystal, pearl, shell, and shared regret layers to a single Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s inspection mission reframed as pastoral connection. Orientation anchors within 40 words; transitions are seamless; the spiral-shell confession lattice is taught early and paid off in the luminous crown image with undeniable conceptual cost (bunker walls everywhere thin).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each graffito enlarges the mosaic of communal wisdom until the final image reweights Mara’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise: “Begin” glows on the brick, crystallizing surrender without promising resolution, and the cost is felt—the warm accordion bellows testify that her breath is now the price of knowing. Orientation, causality, and escalation cohere; no prop or knowledge teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—backward-ticking watch → propagation delay measurements → reversed-shelf book → blank pages bloom—tightens neatly and lands a crisp Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she gains the library but remains time-looped outsider. Orientation is swift; stakes are declared and tested on-page. Closure is present and legible under a Causal lens, though the second letter remains an off-stage tease that slightly deflates the final beat’s irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the violin shatters into stardust while the empire remains unseized, reweighting her stance with undeniable conceptual cost; however, the causal chain from “propagate” to dismantling the dream is compressed into lyric shorthand, forcing the reader to infer rather than witness the decisive internal break.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the emerald dims, Lirael must act; because she embellishes, the pool cracks; because she sings, the chip stabilizes—each link tightens options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she saves the echo but accepts perpetual endangerment of the grotto, paid with on-page fatigue and the aurora’s kiss. Cost is legible—“she slumped forward, exhausted”—and the persistent constraint (threshold forever fragile) shapes future tactics. No orientation debt; transitions clean within single scene; one sharpening move suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: because Elara stole → therefore exile → because merchant haunted → therefore return → therefore Lirael can choose reconciliation. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within 60 words; no debt. Single continuous scene respects scope; transition-free. Closure is a Charged Poise: pinning both shells crystallizes the cycle rule and carries felt social cost—trust now lives in the object. Off-stage merchant return is the one soft coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: shard hum → cloak donned → sensory filter → chime decipher → Mira’s decisive unhooking. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single transition (inside tower) is legible. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the option to keep the cloak and walks into wind he can now “speak,” a visible forfeiture. No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral ripple re-weights the entire rule-set—vanishing is re-defined as *arriving*—with visible cost in Elara’s relinquishing of omniscient control. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stone-throw densifies the pattern until the helix break crystallizes new knowledge. No teleporting props; the obsidian stone’s glow tracks causally. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and are never violated.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final image of descending with pulse-guidance reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: bird-pattern → arrowhead vibration → insight. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Yet the middle third is reflective montage; no beat tightens options or reveals new obstacle, so escalation is flat. The lens holds, but the single tightening is too gentle for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: failed automagic culture → seeks spire → mist-walk → starlight gamble → garden transforms → exits with altered stance. The keystone crack and staircase descent provide a decisive change charged by the personal sketch; cost is the renunciation of spectacle magic, felt in the final line. Orientation is clear by word 60, no debt. One slight causality slack: “the spire trembled” is stated as external effect without clarifying whether Kael’s pour or the keystone itself triggers it, but the gap is too small to rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the key on the desk reweights “luminous vows” from external quest to internal covenant, costing him the talisman of past denial. Causal lens holds: because he enters the library he re-colours Lila’s voice and therefore his future stance. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; the single transition (dock→ship) is legible. However, the tightening beat is singular and late; no intermediate therefore-links raise cost before the final image, keeping escalation shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s raised hands accept the surging wavelength, reconfiguring the prophecy from intellectual puzzle to lived circuit with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—coins → receiver/transmitter insight → alignment protocol → personal conduit—taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 50; lens is causal throughout. One accumulation cap applies (−0.4) because the contraction stakes are declared cosmic yet the on-page price is primarily metaphysical, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the atlas page absorbs the monsters, the prism extinguishes, and Elias exits with “the ache of knowing”—a legible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is sound: prism → light → naming → dissolution, each step because/therefore. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: bell-drip → tide-sync → rift-stitch, each beat sliding the risk higher. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“it’s a start” spoken while the bell’s green copper still cuts him—cost is legible and the lens is cleanly Causal throughout. No orientation debt; all anchors (who/where/when) register inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s added photograph reconfigures her role from solitary watcher to co-guardian of memory, cost felt in the act of relinquishing private grief. Causal chain holds—label→photos→daughter→shared custodianship—though beat spacing is accelerando. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One soft micro-turn (daughter’s reveal) is acceptable; it complicates without resolving. Persistent constraint: the failing dam keeps future pressure real, anchoring the new pact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the equation on parchment reweights the world, and the lingering starling song makes the cost audible. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each sensory pattern (crystal hum → starling choreography → flame test) tightens the stake of merging realms. The one transition (dusk arrival) is legible, and kaleidoscopic waterfall anchors spatial continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: static crack → pattern rupture → buckle ritual → spiral re-alignment → deeper node. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s steady glow re-weights “trust” from burden to language, with the cost of perpetual vigilance now felt. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One paraphrase loop (“keep watching… keep revising…”) slightly dulls final cadence but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure is present—brain reclaimed, clone gone, sky stabilizes—but the decisive energy merge is summarized not dramatized, blurring cost; causal logic ("vivify this rock" as actual terrain rewrite) is fuzzy, weakening the because/therefore chain; orientation is clean inside ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal linkage holds: seed → tests → key with because/therefore clarity; each orthogonal experiment narrows possibilities toward the iron key payoff. Closure is a Charged Poise: the laugh-image reconfigures Elias’s mission from designer to participant, cost felt in surrendered certainty. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no debt. Minor loop: “storm-born silence” phrase reused without intensification; doesn’t dull exit image but prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: laughter bursts back with conceptual cost—his body broken, future unseen—earning Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain thin: tunnel as laughter-bank is asserted, not discovered, so beat-to-beat “therefore” is lyrical leap rather than linkage. Orientation clean by 120 w; one-scene default met. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of air-maceration crescendo is taught early and pays off in shimmer of voices, so legitimacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: lure → wait → renounce → threshold; the tossed pendant is a decisive visible cost that reconfigures access to the library. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; the moss path reveal pays off the garden’s spatial logic. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—uncertainty repriced as home—felt through the ache in Mara’s stilled heart.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: broken relic → successive approximation attempts → vivifying self-sacrifice → nexus bloom, each beat narrowing options and raising cost. Closure lands on-page: the fused crozier hovers, Kael’s hands are “scarred, his mind frayed,” paying the felt price. The Orientation Test is met within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—his maimed hands—shapes any future alchemy, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: fragment glow → vision → dismantling → tower resurrection, each step forcing the next. The “beginning in every ending” closure is dramatized as the gorge fills with liquid light, a conceptual repricing that reweights ruin into rebirth. The orienting anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and remain stable. No cost is paid by Kael beyond a sore palm; a deeper personal price would have lifted this into the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: empty hourglass triggers sideways lurch → radio pattern → dock-layer reveal → commuter merge → ferry dissolution. Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael stands alone, new constellation overhead, life-path foreclosed yet reopened. Cost is legible—“the ferry gone,” “radio silent,” constellation rename. One mild causality quibble: the radio’s “interconnected patterns” mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated, but the effect lands under the Speculative-Trope lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure is present: Lirael’s stance crystallizes into a deliberate act of teaching-by-feel, reconfiguring her own navigation metaphor with visible cost (she yields the relic’s private comfort to public pedagogy). Causality is thin: the chain-link lesson is introduced the same beat it resolves, so the tightening feels convenient rather than earned. Orientation is clean; dome, abyss, alien stars are anchored by word 60. Lens: situational/accumulative hybrid—pressure accrues through luminous imagery more than sequential turns—holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the echoing pulse and mirrored hearing aids build density until the synchronized duet reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by paragraph two; no penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final mist-exhale image crystallizes Lila’s vocation and the widow’s relief. Cost is conceptual, not felt—Lila leaves lighter, no constraint or price—so stays below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands: the gold reweights “invisible” to visible signal, paying conceptual cost. Drive is Accumulative: each sensory layer (rust, salt, hum, hologram) thickens until the map reconfigures memory. Orientation is clean by line 4; no causal breaks; the tide serves as rising density, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias reweights the error from curse to compass, paying the price of permanent cohabitation with the ghost. Causal linkage holds: shard-ink pattern → defy AI → new stance. Orientation is taught early (“opal observatory under snow” by line 3), so the slight spatial vagueness around the console is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bird-pattern and echo-layer thickens the sonic web until the diamond’s fracture reweights the whole. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—the canyon’s new silence and the lingering song reconfigure meaning with felt cost. The only drag is the slightly late “I am extinction” beat that tells us the change rather than showing it crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral etched on the arrowhead reweights her mission from observation to participation, and the cost is felt—“not as a researcher. Not anymore.” Causal lens holds: each beat (arrowhead pulse, confession static, metamorphosis) tightens options under a because/therefore chain. One micro-drag: “she’d return… but not as a researcher” is summary, not dramatized beat; still, the image is charged and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s re-wilding and Lira’s broken violin crystallize a new stance whose cost is the statues’ crumbled emptiness and her own blood on the bridge. Causal chain holds—shell vibration → core flicker → geyser → cracks—tightened by one meaningful escalation. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The −0.4 non-closure cap applies: while the final image reweights meaning, the story does not foreclose future threats, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky-splitting storm reweights the border silence and the arcade’s tomb-future into a ‘quiet rebellion’, a felt before/after. Causality is loose—no concrete link proves the drone release caused the lightning—but the accumulative lens holds: image density (neon, barbed wire, laughter from dead machines) shifts from stasis to fragile motion. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; spatial anchors stay clean. Cost is collective, not personal, keeping the beat just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: images (mist, dust, wildflower circle, fountain ripple code) layer until the courtyard reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift: “abandoned circus train… overgrown yard” anchors by line 3. The halo fragment functions as a CR device—its glow re-prices silence from void to fertile ground, and this lands on-page. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (“interpret silence as possibility”) and paid off in the final image of song completing the space.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is tight: scarf → poet myth → hyperbolic key → candle ritual → mirror corridor → floating manuscripts, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation is clean by word 60; the midnight candle is the decisive change that reconfigures the library’s energy, paid for by Eleanor’s solitude and the poem’s unknowable language. Cost is felt: “her heartbeat quickened,” the scarf now “tied neatly” as perpetual reminder. Closure unit (Charged Poise) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light-images tightens until the final Charged Poise reweights longing into self-recognition with undeniable conceptual cost—“etched into her bones.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) reached by line 3; no debt. Closure effect lands on-page in the last two sentences; persistent constraint (palette empty) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolving hair rewrites the rule that secrets must stay buried, and Elias’s stance crystallises with the phrase ‘ready to carry the weight’. Causal chain holds: star hint → pick → disorientation → voiced truth. Orientation is clean by line 6. One soft spot: the nexus rules (how a street becomes star-field) are taught only by spectacle; a prior sensory cue of instability would remove the mild teleport feel.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive is Accumulative/Textural: repeated images (fairy-ring, broken stars, locket) accrete until the sky-mirror reconfigures meaning. The midpoint alignment of wrecks to mutilated constellations supplies the single tightening demanded at this length. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias sits waiting, options widened, past recovered, future open, cost felt in the weight of “eternal curiosity.” Orientation and causality hold; no meaningful escalations are skipped.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal spine is intact: drought plea → tea divination → “walk backwards” prescription → village girl’s resolve, each beat logically pressing the next. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trapped shard-shadow stretching implies exile’s reversal without declaring victory, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no debt. The mild softness is that the girl’s final yes feels slightly convenient—no new obstacle or price is extracted on-page—so the tightening is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: dissonant waterfall → dream command → harvest sap → seed baptism → rainbow geyser → blossom relay. Orientation lands by line 6; single-scene default met; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she receives the iridescent blossom, proving the seed’s passage and her perpetual custodianship. Cost is felt in the hollow pocket and the unending task, not in lost self, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hush becomes hum, key appears, Mara leaves lighter yet marked—“awake” cost is felt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence-dense object builds pattern, starlight prism refracts meaning, final cadence re-weights stakes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) secured by line 8; no penalty. One causal wobble: Elias’s “He chose silence to protect…” is retro-diagnosis delivered off-stage; fisherman’s choice never dramatized, so the key’s conceptual cost is slightly under-cranked. Still, the beat lands cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: map tear → footage comparison → crack widens → staircase opens, each step tethered to Elias’s active alignment of tools. Orientation is clean within 60 words; the vault, henge, and Chapel anchors stay spatially trackable. Closure earns Charged Poise: the warm silence reconfigures the premise—empathy in the unsaid—and the cost is felt in the irreversible threshold he has crossed. The 1923/static payoff is slightly compressed, a hairline nick.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the 440 Hz hum reweights the snow globe from keepsake to transmission device, giving “letting go” a new physical meaning—felt cost is the acceptance that memory is an orbit, not a grave. Causal chain holds: tape loop → tuning fork → globe motor → redefinition; pressure tightens once via scientific confirmation rather than escalating stakes. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: “quantum communication” exposition is asserted, not demonstrated, slightly blunting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bolt-plate now holds both flower and encoded silence, a charged poise that reweights every prior stroke. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glyph thickens the courtyard’s emotional density until the storm and the dropped plate make the cost tactile. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. The only slip is that the ghost never pushes back, so the tightening is entirely Elias’s self-pressure, narrowing but not fully foreclosing external options.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible: diary discovery → goggles vision → symbol translation → shared recognition with widow. Orientation anchors (who=Mara, where=elevator ascending icebound spire, when=captain’s post-crash aftermath) arrive before the 120-word mark, averting the orientation penalty. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Mara stepping out to “find the flame” reconfigures the stake from servant discretion to active truth-seeker, with the diary as persistent constraint. Cost is present but oblique—loss of servant anonymity is implied, not felt—keeping the story just shy of 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the gondola drifts into dawn while Lila feels the sky’s memory as undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud entry thickens emotional density until the empty air itself reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the snapped tether is mentioned once and never constrains later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the safe and journal survive, the painted constellations will outlive the tree, and Lira walks away having paid the irrecoverable loss of the library itself. Causal chain is clean: coin → panel → safe → journal → repainted sky. The demolition clock supplies relentless external pressure that tightens every beat; no luck resolves the core problem. Cost is legible in the final sentence—“the coin warm in her pocket”—a concrete reminder that future deciphering is still unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: hopscotch pattern → starling gap → portal → luminous orb, each step triggered by Lira’s active decoding. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she returns carrying “a truth” that reweights the ship’s entire mission. The phrasebook cue (“Stranded luminance seeks the key”) is paid off when the orb’s images flood her mind, confirming the map was real. One minor warp: Jax’s instant grin softens the threatened captain consequence, slightly blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: decipher → Hall of Mirrors → false reflection → dissolve → prize; orientation (who/where/when) is secured by line 3 and the lock-opening beat delivers a Decisive Change with felt emotional cost (“connection to the past…mend what was broken in himself”). Lens holds; no meaningful tightening or price beyond the sentimental recognition, so it stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the arch holds, the nebula flares, Elara fades—cost is felt in her vanishing and the bell’s lone chime. Causality is lyric rather than tight because the settlers’ success is a chorus act without individuated turning points; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds. Orientation is clean inside 120 words and the single transition (dawn → sunset) is legible. A hairline slip: the chalk messages multiply without showing how each new instruction changes tactical options, so escalation is more cadence than compression.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—because grandfather’s map leads here, therefore Mara climbs; because the cracked puppet is the map, therefore it ignites the pane; because she accepts her imperfect voice, therefore the world’s clocks soften. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of golden porcelain snow reconfigures “end” from cataclysm to lullaby with undeniable conceptual cost—time itself loses its hard edge. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; escalation tightens once when the pane’s hum becomes irreversible. Persistence of the fractured glass in her palm is the visible price that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: nut map → silent markers → birds evaded → door opened → traveler saved → nut cracked, frost locked in. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene arc tightens once when the birds dive and Kael must freeze or keep guiding. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the nut’s shell and his own future exposure—so the lens stays causal to the end. One minor slack: the “labyrinth shudder” is asserted, not shown to alter his options, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: chrysalis → foam insight → text to Mara → studio rapprochement → joint release. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: they forego perfect harmony but gain a living, flawed duet; the cost is the chrysalis given to the current, felt on-page. One minor scaffold: "as the pieces fell into place" is used twice without pattern payoff, dulling the final cadence a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the floating note dissolves into Elara’s palm, reweighting premise (absence returns as stardust) with visible cost—she now shoulders every untold story. Causal chain is slim—stranger appears, buys jar, vanishes—but the accumulative pattern of absences-taken/returned holds. Orientation is swift; only one transition (day→night) and spatial logic stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causality holds: enter pavilion → absorb remorse → kitchen cook as release. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; no drift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Nessar’s decision to keep cooking rather than purge—charged by the felt weight still in his mouth and the guards’ softened faces. Cost is on-page: “his tongue tingled, the taste of memory fading”; the fortress feels “sturdier,” proving the price was real. Minor ellipsis: founder’s original crime is abstract, but remorse itself functions as the stake; causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swinging brass weight reconfigures the social divide with conceptual cost—the tower now “speaks” in many tongues. Causality is accumulative/textural: repeated multilingual lullabies soak the gears until the final chord erupts, a pattern taught early and paid off. One soft causality slip: the elevator’s “clear note” arrives unprompted, but coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens rules. Orientation is swift; starlight, tower, and villager gap are anchored within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal linkage holds: cracked mirror → laser etch → memory splice → resealed glass, each beat a because/therefore step that narrows options. The midpoint memory-voice (“I buried it here”) is a decisive hinge that changes Kael’s tactics. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror’s iridescent mosaic makes the entanglement’s social/psychic cost undeniable. One minor scaffold loop—“the mirror wasn’t just reflecting light; it was reflecting her”—is forgiven because it crystallizes the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: decipher → enter → invert → seize key → exit transformed. Gravity inversion lands as a decisive change with visible cost (upward fall, scraped boots), satisfying closure. One minor causality gap: the doodle map appears only after inversion, so its predictive power feels retrofitted rather than fore-structured.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grove’s new “heartbeat” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost—music now lives in wind and moss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each porcelain strum thickens texture until pattern break (shatter) re-configures meaning. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no因果 gaps. Cost is the insulator itself and Elara’s bloodied hands—both on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is revealed as living pattern, the queen-diagonal maps onto the Shattered Sword constellation, and the mirror-leaf sapling reweights “beauty in the difficult.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural: stone, eclipse, chessboard sky tighten into a single cadence shift. Causality holds: every image is seeded early and paid off in the final image; cost is legible in the exile’s tear and the irreversible planting.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the diary snaps shut, reweighting silence from barrier to bridge; cost is felt in the image of Lirael walking away from forced speech into listening. Causal chain (hum → resonance → click) is thin but holds under Accumulative lens; fireworks cadence deepens the pattern. Orientation is clean by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scent-notes → doodle cadence → bloom image tightens stakes through density, not causal reversals. Closure is Charged Poise: the flower’s scent reconfigures village hierarchy with undeniable social cost—elders humbled, children laughing. Orientation is clean by line 6; no prop or knowledge teleport. Dream beat is brief, anchored, and paid off in altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: arrow tip → cavern socket → permanent inversion. One soft spot: gravity inversion is declared “forever” without on-page proof; the stakes jump off-screen. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s role pivots from extractor to guardian—yet price is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Continuous scene, single POV, and causal chain hold: gust → climb → reveal. Orientation secured by line 7 (“salt-stained gravel”) well before the 120-word mark. Closure lands as CR: the port’s transformation into sentient machine re-weights every earlier wind reading; cost felt through patch vibration synced to heartbeat. Slight haze: missing-engineer stake is introduced late, so the earlier investigation feels procedural rather than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s silence becomes an audible hymn and Veyra’s marble pulses with light, both undeniable conceptual repricings. Causal linkage holds: Lira’s color-song melts the sculpted hush and rewires Veyra’s disbelief, each because/therefore step visible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; ice, aurora, and bell are spatially anchored. The “amber sheet kiss” beat is slightly outline-like—more gesture than trigger—but it does not break the chain. Cost is legible in the final image: the cavern can never return to muteness; wonder is now infrastructural.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each flute passage layers density until silence itself reweights meaning. Orientation (who/where/when) is locked by word 50; no penalty applied. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken flute and new surrender-rune crystallize Kael’s shift from striving to accepted fragility, cost visible in the snapped reeds and rearranged markers. Causality remains intact because the final silence is the direct cumulative consequence of every prior note played.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s crystallized stance “he didn’t need to borrow…” reweights premise with felt cost (tears, fragment obedience). Causal chain holds: invented poem → fragment dimming → empathy merge → press chaos → stance shift. Orientation clear by line 20; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—fragment now alive in his palm—shapes future. One micro paraphrase loop (“light flickered…light flared”) is non-closure; negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—aurora and pendant cadence build density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sapling image crystallizes Kail’s new stance with legible cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3, but the causal trigger for accepting the seed is weakly motivated—he kneels because “the pendant vibrated harder,” not an active choice. One micro-turn (woman appears → gives seed) tightens once; sufficient for length, but the off-page mentor solve dilutes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism-as-lens distorts instead of discovers, reweighting her theory with visible cost—she pockets the cold prism and laughs bitterly. Causal lens holds: because she projects, the quartz flares; therefore she must accept the mirror. Orientation anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each puzzle-fit, crow theft, and bead-glow thickens atmosphere and narrows Mara’s option space toward the ultimate sacrifice; closure lands as Charged Poise—her loom now weaves silence into song for distant ears, cost felt in bead-loss and loom-stillness. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but pattern is taught early (“thread by thread”) and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clean: silk → mine → shard trial → orb → bloom. Closure lands with visible planetary change, but the personal price is abstract (warmth in palm) rather than a lasting constraint on Jorin. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One soft reset: the orchard instantly re-blooms, muting cost. Sufficient tightening for 7-band, but lacks persistent price for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: shard pull → platform → portal → mother-world → shard rejection → return, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: hurling the shard forecloses reunion and costs the certainty he chased. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no debt applied. One minor lapse: the visor’s lattice rules are never re-consulted after the jump, so the final stability reads slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stacked stones become a surrogate beacon, reweighting safety from lamp-light to communal ritual; the “luminescent ache” is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each note and stack deepens pattern rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The only cost is the unlit lamp, but that external loss is transferred to an internalized ritual without a visible price paid by Elias himself—slightly softening the sting.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each adjustment of the wick layers density until the lantern’s trapped light bursts into prophetic shadows. Closure is a Charged Poise—she hoists the lantern, reconfiguring dawn from time-marker to choice, with the implicit cost that she must forever feed the flame. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished wing reweights Lin’s perception of her grafted life and vocation, with felt cost (“its lesson remained—a flicker of iridescent caution”). Causality under Accumulative lens holds: sun-trail pattern → wing release → shared aura among patrons → new vocation. Orientation is swift; only one transition (terrace → chamber) and spatial logic stays clean. The beat sequence is lightly episodic—wing flare, instant group epiphany, instant life-purpose reset—so escalation is more luminous than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of glowing roots reweights the premise that sorrow is legible and transmutable. Causal chain is thin—why dismantling the sextant cracks the wall is never grounded—but the accumulative pattern (storm → moon → map → roots) coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean by line 10; no debt. Setup ambiguity about “quantified sorrow” lingers but is taught through action and paid off in the final reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each song-extraction adds luminous density until night frays. The greenhouse breathes in forgotten dreams and exhales dawns—causality is poetic but legible. Closure gives a Charged Poise: realm brightens, Lira hoarse yet smiling, cost felt in her trembling exhaustion. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. The only causality gap—how song trapped in mica becomes communal daylight—is elided, not explained, but pattern teaches early so the leap is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    A tight causal spine: invitation → password → map → mirrors → letters; each step narrows her options while the mother’s voice retroactively furnishes motive. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she stays while leaving, cost felt in the hush against her back.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden becomes a living map of fractures in creeping normality, and the sunflower seed reweights meaning without exposition. Causality is light, mostly associative; the Accumulative/Textural lens is internally coherent and sustained. Orientation is clear by 65 words; no penalty applied. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn-light flares, illusions brighten, and Elara’s smile crystallizes the cost—her body and years of failed attempts behind that moment. Causal lens holds: each frequency sampled therefore re-assembles one vow therefore rekindles one layer of library magic. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside first 90 words; no debt incurred. One schematic beat—“she adjusted the lantern’s lens”—could be slightly more lived-in, but the beat is brief and does not dampen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: each misstep (bribed dockhand lies, jester-courier lost) tightens the 11:47→midnight clock and funnels Lira to the tower. The recorded betrayal is both reversal and motive revelation, forcing her decisive smash. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked-yet-ticking fob reweights “hush” from survival tactic to self-authored violence. Cost is on-page: father’s voice exposed, device destroyed, market implodes—her inheritance literally bloodied.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: compass frozen, Kael’s epistemic stance shifted, cost tasted (“lavender and regret”) on the page. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of taste-signals intensifies then breaks at aurora-fracture, reweighting stakes. Orientation clean by word 40; no teleporting props; causality intact—Lira’s arrival complicates but does not resolve. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lock clicks, the shadow-door opens, silence is “rectified,” and the final image of sketching re-weights his earlier stasis with undeniable felt cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (lock + canvas + cave light) and paid off in the投射 shadow. Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, when by line 3). No telegraphing or soft resets; the grandmother memory could have tightened present causality but does not break it.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: plate → map → room → orb → lie-detection → renunciation; each beat narrows possibility. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Archive is hollow yet fertile, costing Elara her literalist hope while gifting her a regenerative stance. Cost is legible in the emptied orb she still cradles. One minor causality bump: the keeper’s instant surrender of the orb feels slightly convenient, but the quill’s un-wilt justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of melting→music→crowd silence accretes meaning; final bell-stroke is Charged Poise with undeniable cost (“the symphony had not ended—it had simply transformed”). Orientation clean by line 3; causality is lyrical, not because/therefore, yet holds. No meaningful tightening beat inside the spiral—ice drip is steady, not a turning screw—so escalation stays flat. Closure lands with conceptual repricing (“truth made audible”) and felt environmental cost; suffices for 7-band, lacks persistent constraint that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s absorption crystallizes her new stance under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds—magnetic drift → seal frays → burn → miniaturize → integration—but the middle pivot (torching the box) is under-motivated; the leap from soil-burn memory to psychic containment needs one causal bridge. Still, the ending image reweights the whole dome as another box, paying off the concept with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is straightforward—find locket → gather stories → guess combo → open mailbox—but every turn depends on off-stage lore told in summary rather than dramatized pressure. The ending lands a Conceptual Repricing (unfinished 1943 letter), yet the cost is historical, not personal, so the lens tilts Accumulative rather than Causal at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: deciphering the dance → dice alignment → drawer opens → antidote revealed. Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael stands ashore, dice clinking, laboratory sinking—options re-weighted, vulnerability recast as weapon. Cost is conceptual (the site lost, future unknown) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 9+. Orientation clean within 120 words; lens (Causal) stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens: “because the whale died → salt chamber anomalies appear → Elias follows coffee-ground spiral → finds memory vault” links cleanly; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the salt-rose reweights the premise—memories are not destroyed but archived, shifting Elias’s quest from recovery to curation; cost is felt in the quiet forfeiture of his own restored past. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who/where/when) and the 120-word mark beats; no penalty. One hairline slip: “pockets of gravity” rule-set is never causally explained, risking mild deus ex machina, but coherence survives under fable contract.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane dissolves, the brook restarts, and the hush is now materially inside the world. Causal linkage is light—prophecy → map → wing → silence—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, firefly-pause, and paper fiber accrues until the cadence itself flips. Cost is legible in the dust left in her palm, a tactile forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seal’s glow and the answering voice reconfigure stakes with felt cost. Causal chain is present—lie agreed → seal placed → voice answers—yet the middle tightening is summary (“the library shuddered”) rather than dramatized beat. Orientation is clean by 120 wds; lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shell fragment layers resonance until the cadence shift at dawn collapses the garden into ash. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing constellations on her skin—whose cost is the garden’s death and her irrevocable renunciation of archived sorrow. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“velvet garden at twilight”) and never drifts. Causality is interior but legible: isolation transmuted into autonomy through literalized resonance. The final “I’ll come back” reprises the mother’s broken promise, now stolen from the universe, a conceptual repricing that sticks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the scroll in the niche, the thorn in sleeve, the aurora overhead re-weight the whole premise—this was never theft but ritual restitution. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each dripping stalactite thickens time until the final silence equals completion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift. The spiral key is seeded early, reprised at the margin, and charges the final image without late exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon “sings back,” reweighting Kael’s mission from question to custodian; cost is felt in the transferred burden of endless listening. Causal lens holds—each shell-listening beat tightens knowledge—but escalation is soft; the lullaby voice and standing-stone vision are gifts, not stakes he must wager against. Orientation is clean by 120 words. Single-scene default met; no teleport or retro-patch. Non-closure cap: one mild scaffold loop (“the echoes are not just sound” twice in four paragraphs) keeps it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe on the altar re-casts all prior dream-images into living legacies, and the cost is the ghost’s relinquishment of Kael’s attention—felt in the candles’ final flare. The dream-relay structure teaches its pattern early; each shard tightens the thematic stake while the glacier shrine stays continuously anchored. Causality is interior and accumulative rather than event-driven, but the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the firefly cipher reweights Kael’s world-rule from “beauty as grandeur” to “beauty as hidden labor,” with the whisk-shadow ritual showing visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory pulse (mist, moon-path, whistle echo) thickens pattern density until the final cadence shift. No orientation drift; anchoring who/where/when is clear by line 4. The Lens holds—textural intensification, not because-therefore reversals—and the final image makes the new valuation undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: diamond discovery → letters → stillpoint risk → sealing. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis—she pays with the diamond’s loss and accepts ongoing uncertainty about Crane. Cost is visible ("the diamond’s weight gone"). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each tuning of the radio tightens knowledge and narrows options until the prism mechanism literalizes the “split.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael re-weights the storm from threat to instrument, cost legible in the sand defying gravity. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“observatory’s cobalt glass portico”). No teleporting props; hourglass state tracked throughout. Slight over-reliance on lyric summary between beats keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias returns to the loft having given away the songs, now transmitter not owner; the box’s continuing hum crystallizes the trade-off. Causal linkage holds—each jar poured → box plays → faces soften → coins clink; the final loop to the loft re-anchors dawn, dunes, and cot under one lens. No orientation drift; who/where/when fixed in first 40 words. Cost is felt but could be sharper—pocketed coins acknowledge price, yet the surrender of private lullaby is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (frequency drop → ghost arrival → sonic counter) tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s song stabilizes, Elias pockets it with trembling legs—cost felt. One micro-turn (ghost软化) is earned, not luck. Missing a persistent price that shapes tomorrow’s tactics keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grid-locking filings and ice ripples make the before/after legible, cost paid in bodily fatigue and foreclosed haste. Causal chain holds: mis-alignment → moonbeam cue → fractional realignment → controlled surge. One scaffold sentence (“He thought of the elders’ words…”) could trim without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: lantern vision → suspicion → files → resolve to expose. The hidden-compartment reveal is a mild convenience, but the prior lantern beats justify access. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her tactical switch to “empirical observation” severs Cole’s memory-manipulation chain. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is firm by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Marcus pockets the clockwork heart and commits to “deliberate, meaningful steps,” reconfiguring the warden’s program as a living redemption engine; the cost is the moral weight he now carries. Causal chain is slim but intact—because he sees the heart, therefore he reframes the mission—holding the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; storm and shop anchor by line 4. No meaningful tightening occurs mid-scene; escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing, keeping the piece below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain holds: kaleidoscope images → transliteration → aerodynamic tweaks → bell strike. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sea, workshop, and sky re-ringing to a bell no one else can hear yet, cost felt in the acid mist shudder. Orientation locked by word 30; no prop or motif teleporting. The lens is Causal throughout; no soft resets or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage is clean: each 7-14-21 sighting tightens the search vector, Hale’s lie escalates access denial, and the decrypted video rewrites the mission rules. The closure is a Decisive Change—coordinates uploaded, path foreclosed—paid for by drone pursuit and job loss. Cost is legible in the upload moment; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “Across the echo of forgotten songs” is poetic throat-clearing that could be cut without loss, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ice stilled, aurora brightened, cost implied by the personal energy spent, lens held (Accumulative/Textural). Causality is soft—fragment → empathy → calm storm—but pattern is taught early and re-weights the stake at the end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words. No meaningful tightening inside the arc; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, so cost feels diffuse rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each icy pass tightens the texture of endings until the antique boat surfaces as a pattern break. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—"she felt a flicker of something like peace"—that reconfigures her stance toward living. Causality stays clean: the parasol tip she chose to carry becomes the tool that enables the rescue; no teleporting props. The only minor slack is the off-stage euthanasia-clinic stake that never materially complicates the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causality holds: letter → conversation → walk → charged poise in rain. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no prop teleport or knowledge drift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “imperfect dance” crystallizes stakes with felt cost—both futures now narrowed, not solved. Persistent constraint: the letter’s ash still in Lila’s pocket, rain starting, last bus gone—options materially shrink.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is present—prophet arrives → parapet activates → consecration ritual—but the stakes jump from zero to cosmic in one beat (“sages demand consecration”) without intermediate tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parapet locks, the pavilion hushes, the echo is “safe,” and Mara walks on. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than felt; no forfeiture or irreversible loss is dramatized. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the field and factory already are the masterpiece, so her lens shifts from making to witnessing. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of arcs, seasons, returns—held cleanly to the last image. Cost is legible in the shift from “transmute pain” to “enough,” though compressed into a single word rather than dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s refracted light reweights the premise—growth is non-linear—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust, shelves, crystal reflections accumulate until they force the new map of knowledge; the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thickened chalk line reweights the premise—acceptance of fragmentary memory. The accumulative lens holds: driftwood pattern + fog density escalate to the resonant hum. Orientation is clear by line 3. Cost is abstract but legible in the final image. Causality remains soft—why the sound appears now is coincidence—but under an accumulative rubric that is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens: every gear-solder, every harmonic adjustment narrows options until the clock hand’s final spin literally opens the portal. Closure is a Decisive Change—Elias leaps—but the cost is conceptual (he abandons the observatory and his life’s ethos) rather than viscerally felt on the page. The Orientation Test is passed: lunar observatory, dawn quake, Elias alone are anchored by line 3. No teleporting props; the brass ear trumpet is introduced, used, and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: key-study → constellation alignment → key-turn → gateway reveal. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost—shadows condense into a time-reversed realm, reweighting the isle’s reality. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no debt. The “spoons bent reality” catalyst is confessed but not dramatized, a slight teleported-prop wobble that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly because each beat is a because/therefore link: substitute body → village panic → Mara’s return with tooth → fountain re-alignment → path opens. The climax is a decisive physical act (placing both teeth) that re-lights the fountain and re-opens the maze; cost is visible—Elias’s aged grief and the permanent slice on Mara’s thumb. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no teleporting props. Closure avoids explain-everything drift; the garden simply forgives, a quiet Charged Poise that reconfigures their options without forced exposition. A 0.1 shave for a micro-loop in mid-story description keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each polishing stroke adds density until the pool mirror and sky-dissolve reweight meaning. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the pearl’s vanishing revalues “stillness” as shared transience—yet the cost (she now owns nothing) is implied rather than felt on the page. Transitions are lyric, not causal, so the slight drift is acceptable under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant now contains living moss, materially altering the relic’s meaning and foreclosing pure mourning. Causal chain holds—because Elias names the drip rhythm, Lila trusts him to modify the amber; therefore she invites him to stay, deepening the garden’s future. Orientation is complete by word 90. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative pattern (drip map → orchid → sapling) tightens once to final image with felt cost: the brother’s amber is no longer a sealed tomb.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the deleted chapter and open door visibly rewire Clara’s creative stance with conceptual cost—“trusting the journey” is no longer an abstraction. Causal chain holds: shell-key → nexus tour → deletion → new last line, each step shrinking her options toward uncertainty. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 60. One soft spot: the woman’s dissolve is lightly deus-ex-mist, but it complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—golden threads pool, sapling trembles—so the harvest-moon crescendo can read as pattern-break rather than causal domino. Closure lands in Charged Poise: the sapling already “trembling with new stories” makes the cost of endless tending legible without declaring it. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the single transition (dusk→moonrise) is sign-posted. Persistent constraint: the spent tendril dust literally powders Lira’s lap, a tactile reminder that tomorrow she must invent anew.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the orchard’s hush thickens via sensory accretion until the silver seal crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift; causality is looser—starlight responsiveness is poetic rather than strictly ruled, but the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“guide to the heart”). Loss of three prior attempts is efficiently elided without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: broken timer → reverse-engineering via light angles → successful harvest restart; each step grows from the last with visible mechanism. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—“wonder bottled for later” reweights the premise and leaves Elias descending into a cellar that now feels like a grave. The Orientation Test is passed early; lens is Causal throughout. A crisper cost image at the final beat would have nudged this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each melted burden tightens the grotto’s ambient weight, cadence shift from metallic stench to pine air re-prices stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: final image of fractals clinking beneath starlight reweights premise—he carries patterns, not wounds—cost is the untouched locket and perpetual duty he accepts. Causality intact: every softening traced to lamp angle; no coincidences. Orientation anchored by line 4; transitions clean.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, kettle steam, and wood shavings layer into a density shift that reweights loss from void to vessel. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sleeping lion on the sill reconfigures absence into held light; the cost is felt in the cold kettle, the candle stub, the sawdust still clinging to her palms.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dropped camera and the violet rose re-weight the premise—letting go is possible—cost is the forfeiture of scavenger identity and the literal disappearance of the wheel. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fragment-collection → release → floral return; final image crystallizes meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3: “lagoon above the clouds… at dawn.” No causal break; stakes tighten once when camera is released, foreclosing repair dream.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causality holds: find sextant → reroute flows → light equation = Decisive Change with irreducible visual cost. Orientation anchor appears by word 88, beating the 120-word limit; no penalty. The lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure. One tightening beat—she commits the sextant to the crater—flips the terminal from dead to generative; the formula’s glow is the charged image, paying conceptual cost instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single causal lens: because the keep has kept her safe/small, therefore the bear-forecourt harmony offers a reversible option—she refuses full flight yet rewrites the rule-set. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 30; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of repairing clocks while listening for “silence between beats” reconfigures the meaning of both clock and keep with undeniable cost—she still hears the wild, now from within. Persistent constraint: the keep remains her compass, not her cage—this price shapes tactics and is legible on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: sundial shadow → warehouse → blueprint, each link tightening the lens from myth to media-manipulation. Closure is a crisp conceptual repricing: the “machine” that edits reality is revealed, and Elias’s world tilts. Cost is present but abstract—the captain’s warning and the dawn light imply he can never unread what he’s seen—yet the price is not dramatized on his body or future. The single-scene orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dock becomes a “temple to patience” and the glass a “promise,” reweighting the premise that preservation is the true loom. Causal chain (glass → rope → woman → renunciation) lands with felt cost: he relinquishes ownership of discovery. Orientation anchored by 120 w (“golden dock… creaked under Elias’s boots”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (knot-map → knot-stars → knot-roots) deepens until final image crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each textured return of the silver thread thickens the pattern until the final “map of lives restored” re-weights the stake. Orientation is clean—garden, twilight, thread anchor by line 4. The single causal micro-turn (thread hums → vision appears) is thin, but the design is lyric accumulation, not because/therefore. Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: the thread’s glow reconfigures Elara’s vocation from chronicling to walking, with the felt cost of perpetual loneliness legible in “she would spend her life solving.”

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing orb reweights the world’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (“the metal fading, the stone blooming”). Causal linkage is tight—each assembly tweak is reacted to by the egg—so lens holds. The −0.1 reflects the slightest over-crank in the final “we” beat, which tells the reconfiguration rather than letting the image fully own it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the released grain + coin jingle reweight “scars can sing” with undeniable social cost—she will keep carrying the arson stigma. Causal linkage holds: because she splints the bird with the coin lie, therefore Mara releases it, therefore Lira can release the grain and reconfigure her own scar-rule. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; the lyrical accumulative pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the marble’s clink ignites a city-wide re-inflation of memory, undeniable and legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breadcrumb intensifies the stained glass box’s hum—culminating in the charged image of firefly-memories swirling. The Orientation Test is met within 120 words, and the final cost is the city’s own resurfaced grief; Lira’s empty box under her arm is the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Lumin plants the gear, accepting the quieter-fire ethic with conceptual cost (ancestral guilt → future possibility). Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; urgency pings accumulate until the final crystallization. Causality stays intact, but the ghost encounter is coincidence-heavy; however, it complicates rather than resolves, so allowable. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“quiet electricity…alive”) and held: each return deepens pattern—ribbon colors, butterfly shadows, ancestral poems—until the last line reweights grief as door, not hole. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern flares/dims, ribbon is rolled, flight pattern lingers in bones—felt cost is legible without exposition. Transitions are seamless; orientation anchored by word 50. No causal reversals are needed; density and cadence do the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s slow re-start and ridge self-sealing show visible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is internal and lyrical—rake inscription meets bob runes, tide answers—rather than external antagonism; the pattern is taught early by the stalled swing and holds through the final image. One soft spot: the rake’s prior history is conjured rather than dramatized, slightly thinning the “earned” feel.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tapestry decoding delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the same threads that seemed decorative become a temporal map, reweighting Elara’s gardener role into “gardener of time.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because-therefore, but the final image of reburying the case carries visible cost—she now carries knowledge she can never share with the living—so closure lands with felt price under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from inkwell to thaw. Closure is a clean CR—the burning of journals reweights the premise, showing innovation’s price is erasure of its own record. Orientation anchor hits at word 18; no penalty. Transitions = 0 (single scene). One meaningful tightening at the equinox crack; cost is legible in the final ash image. No closure-touching slips.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each lyric fragment layers density until the final halo reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—alcove, cliff, ashen plains by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the merging glow crystallizes her role as “ghost bard” while the plains stay vast and silent; cost is the lifetime vigil she accepts. Persistent constraint—static will always fade—shapes every dial turn.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gallery exhales, the portrait blurs, and Lira exits with ash-glitter hands—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact because her decision to stop is the direct result of the gallery’s long-taught ephemerality. Orientation is secure within 120 words. The piece does not tighten a second time; one meaningful deepening is acceptable at this length, so escalation is adequate, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cog-needle assemblage reweights “time is layered” and the sewer drip/gear hum crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each sedimentary find thickens thematic density until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation (who/when above ground) is taught early and pays off in the closing heartbeat image. One scaffold sentence (“His hands bled, his back ached, but he didn’t stop”) is tolerated because it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accretive/Textural lens holds: autumn light, dust motes, and rosette glow accumulate texture that reweights the stake at the end. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the glowing rosette crystallizes options and cost under the “vanishing arts” motif. However, no persistent constraint shapes tactics; the library never limits or endangers their project. Cost is legible only as conceptual, not dramatized through forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the future-garden vision reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—each cut triggers memory-surge that shapes next action—though the “because” linking violet light to bud emergence is lightly asserted rather than mechanized. Orientation is clean by word 80; lens is Accumulative/Textural and sustains to final image. Persistent constraint (rusted greenhouse as last seed sanctuary) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → drone wreck → box discovery → riddle → wonder diagnosis → public confession → power restored. One clean transition (night-to-morning) is legible; orientation anchors who/where by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s booth sermon crystallizes a new civic stance; cost is felt in her exposure and the tower’s now-dependent fragility. Slight slip: Voss’s late “explain-everything” speech flattens causality for one beat, but Clara’s subsequent action re-tightens the through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of displaced-object finds culminates in a hush-anchoring tableau; the ripple of light is a clean Conceptual Repricing that makes “alive houses” undeniable. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; causality stays internal and legible. Cost is present as atmospheric shift rather than tangible sacrifice, so closure lands softly rather than irresistibly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the drink is a Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s quest flips from “retrieve cure” to “become vector,” with felt ecological cost. Causal chain holds: thread pry → ampoule free → ingestion → blight recedes. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the garden’s blooming density re-weights stakes. Cost is on-page in the final breath-like shudder; no orientation drift past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the staircase keeps breathing, Kael keeps climbing, but meaning flips—possession is replaced by witnessed perpetual motion, final image “pinpricks of light.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each die appearance, ozone taste, and charcoal proof thickens pattern until the rupture crystallizes the stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are late (~140 words) but the deliberate disorientation is taught and echoed in closure, so Orientation Test is waived. Cost is unmistakable: “He’d captured what he came for, not in his hands.” No meaningful escalation before the rupture beat; single intensification suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Mr. Voss recognizes his mother’s worry in the painted eyes, giving Lila a new linguistic path—but the moment is coincidence-driven (he walks in) rather than caused by her prior choices, so the causal spine wobbles. The “lost language” stake is announced but never narrows her options on-page; she doesn’t fail or adapt because of it. Orientation is clear, yet the lens toggles between accumulative lyric and situational coincidence without teaching a pattern, so the tightening feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald lens refracts torch-light over singing children, re-weighting displacement into communal continuance with felt cost in the undertone of absence (beekeeper). Accumulative/textural lens holds—density rises from water/roar/yeast to final green-gold flare. Orientation clean by line 5; causality intact. Escalation is gentle pattern-deepening rather than narrowing options; the tightening is lyrical, not tactical, which keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: found stone → reverse-engineer yoyo → mercury coil → lighthouse awakens; each step tightens options. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the island “breathes,” time slips, Elias crosses a threshold he cannot uncross. One causality micro-gap: the lighthouse mechanism is said to be dark for decades, yet gears engage instantly—no prior hint of latent power. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: curse → cloak → paradox → thread → new light. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (seared hand, steady glow). Orientation is clean by word 80. The dream-dictionary rule is introduced late yet still governs the final tactic, so causality survives. No persistent constraint is established post-victory, keeping the win from feeling priced.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each percussive layer thickens ambient tension until the night salt settles in a Charged Poise. Causality is not of the because/therefore kind but of resonance-densification; the driftwood circle’s groan under strain is the visible price, landing on the page in the penultimate paragraph. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by word 50. Closure earns its salt: the air still hums with ghost frequencies, a conceptual repricing that reweights the earlier “obstacles are instruments” premise. Minor cap: the absence of a second tightening midpoint keeps it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: mural notes → whistle sequence → tunnel opens; journal → watchers move → shells wake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by 80 words and serve closure. The single decisive change—“gate rusted shut to keep *us* in” lands with conceptual cost, reweighting premise. One causality wobble: watchers’ exact powers remain opaque yet are allowed under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inscription “Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed” reweights the premise under an Accumulative lens, making the lie’s cost legible. Causality is clean: petal-drop → tunnel → chamber → re-dated ledger → reframed mandate. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. Single transition (platform→tunnel) is legible. The −0.8 non-closure cap applies: one telegraphed twist (Tomas’s quiet follow) and one soft reset (she “smiled” without on-page forfeiture) keep the ending shy of 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink-stained inkwell lighter in her palm images the conceptual repricing—absence becomes connective tissue, not void. Causal chain holds: inkwell → note in crack → hatch discovery → desk inscription → new note signed with cost. The 120-word anchor is cleanly met; drawbridge ritual teaches isolation early. One hairline slip: the groan-under-floor is coincidence-level, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene arc taught early: blackout → vault search → truth found; each beat because/therefore linked under Causal lens. Door-open image delivers Decisive Change with felt cost (stale air, heavy journal); city’s self-betrayal reweights premise. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“sunken city,”“forgotten library”), waiving any penalty. No causality breaks; only hairline slip is off-page flood backstory summarized, not dramatized, keeping it sub-9 by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: grief → basilica trick → lantern craft → shadow confrontation. One tightening beat—lantern flares, spires shed shards—narrows options and visibly pays the cost (her trembling fingers, dissolved shadow). Closure is Charged Poise: she forecloses retreat, claims next crane; cost is legible in the charged "ready" smile.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: shard-pulse reveals veins → node → she enters. Closure lands as Charged Poise: new crystal, vanished observatory, undeniable conceptual cost—she can now “see” nodes. Orientation anchor at 90 words is clean; no lens ambiguity. Deduction for slight explanatory overload in Orion’s late warnings that don’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: pilgrim’s arrival → Lira’s pursuit → prism alignment → lever pull → chip reassembly → tonal shift to “listen.” Orientation anchors by line 4; no missteps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the decoded frequency reweights “belonging” from place to resonance; cost is the humming stones and her chilled boots—felt, not declared. Lever mechanics are foreshadowed by blueprint hologram, so final rotation feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: guilt → driftwood method → vision → decision to confess, each step tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the stopped watch and cobalt dusk reconfigure Elias’s rules—he chooses truth-telling as a new, dangerous ethic with felt cost. One minor scaffold—Lila’s off-page voice is declared panic but never concretely tests his nerve. Still, the driftwood visions are dramatized, not summarized, satisfying the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of handle-as-memory tightens through tactile reprise until Clara releases it, reweighting “neutral territory” from place to ethical stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where letting go crystallizes the cost of remembering. One transition (parapet → exchange courtyard) is legible; spatial anchors clear by 120 words. No causality break; the warden’s rule is not plot-critical, only thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the compass abandoned on the railing reweights the premise—regret is not a map but tide. Causal chain holds: fight → solo launch → compass “measures regret” → lighthouse leave-taking. The single transition (beach → lighthouse → return) is legible; orientation anchored by line 3. One hairline slip: “utility poles seemed to shift” is never explained—micro breach of world-rules that nudges score down from 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Mara vows to “read the world more carefully,” cost legible in the secret glow of the baseball. Causal chain, however, is thin—how does J.T.’s lake appearance follow from the newspaper map? Orientation clears within 120 words, but the lake’s rule-set (regret-fed bacteria) is asserted, not demonstrated. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence reweights meaning, yet a firmer cause→effect bridge would sharpen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: violet-glow spice → fox-feather → obsidian shard → feathered skin each deepen the same stake. Closure is Charged Poise: “bridge, conduit, keeper” crystallizes new identity with undeniable cost—she will never again be merely human. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (reflection on fortune) is brief, anchored to present smell, and tilts her stance—meets BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the healed saucer and new handprint reconfigure the meaning of lost time under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each card and unfastening tightens the pattern until the straight crack replaces the question mark. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation in the first 120 words pays off when the glass-city vision anchors the timeline. Cost is legible in the final image—“her mother’s, traced in onyx ink”—a permanent alteration of the birthday cloth.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the door opens, the ship reboots, and Lira’s pacifism is recast from avoidance to courageous engagement. Causal lens holds—because she confronts her shadow, the Tear dissolves and the dimension unlocks—visible cost is the shattering locket and her body’s new weightless state. Orientation is anchored by word 32; no penalty. One micro-turn (locket dim → flares) tightens stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the release of each bug intensifies pattern and cadence rather than causal chain. Closure lands as Charged Poise—constellation-map footprint and quieted volcano re-weight her premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no penalty. The prophecy mechanics remain off-stage (“verses in a poem written centuries ago”) so the Decisive Change feels slightly abstract; cost is felt but not specific enough for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal chain is clear: blackout → quill test → stair reveal. Orientation anchors land before the 120-word mark; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the Council will soon see the new basement—so cost is social rather than personal; still legible. One minor lapse: “the grooves match” knowledge is asserted, not demonstrated, a hairline causality nick.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian heart-rock dims the dust, eels weave a sigil, and Lira’s stance flips from solver to witness—cost is the foregone certainty of control. Causal chain (rock sequences → dust pulses → pattern visibility) holds; the borrowed-dawn lens stays accumulative/textural and pays off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed poem crystallizes both stance and risk—publisher gamble under Ministry threat—cost felt in the storm-lit wax seal. Causal chain intact: envelope → cartographer’s poem → mirror moment → Kael’s counter-poem. Orientation anchored within 120 words (observatory, storm, gas-mask). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “rarefy” images tightens until final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the card’s star-map reweights the duel from victory to translation, cost felt when they sheath blades and accept open questions. Causal lattice holds—every parry angles off the sundial code—but the “debate gone wrong” backstory arrives untethered to any present stimulus, a mild causality blur.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the new poem reweights the rule-set—no longer rebuilding identity but growing *through* anarchy—with felt cost in the smile that concedes perpetual loss of stable self. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of tin/hand/spine imagery layers until the final line crystallizes the shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 30; no penalty. One micro-turn—finding a poem in his own unknown hand—tightens stakes without breaking causality. Cost is undeniable: he forecloses the fantasy of ever finishing the rebuild.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the descent to the secret room, the ticking unbroken clock, the decision to leave the keys vibrating constitute an Earned Stasis that forecloses her earlier paralysis with tangible cost (the compasses outside spin unchecked). Causal chain holds: film reel → hidden hatch → playable score → new stance. Orientation is secure by line 6; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands: the seed’s surrender + mirror re-formation create a Charged Poise that reweights the island’s future. Causality is lyric-accumulative: seed → dream → mirror-test → resealed memory; each step is legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The “cost” is collective (possible amnesia averted) rather than personal, so the price feels faintly external, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft-edged Charged Poise: the sea calms, the ship vanishes, and “hearts are finally at peace,” but the severance-door rule is introduced late and the compass-lace mechanics are asserted rather than tested; causality is lyric rather than earned. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 60, satisfying the single-scene window.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines scientific value through dust patterns and chrysalis spirals, with tangible cost—the institute’s confusion, professional isolation.

The monarch’s emergence provides a decisive intensification, its spiral dust pattern becoming the story’s resonant image. Orientation is clear by line 30, and every shard feeds the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirael redefines her art not as object-making but as marking “quiet intervals,” with visible cost—abandoning vases/mirrors for ephemeral teaching. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: frost patterns, ledger lines, and glass shard coalesce into a star map that reweights her purpose. Cost is legible in her warm-pocketed shard and altered studio plans. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; causality flows through pattern recognition, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined from absence to expressive medium, with tangible cost (permanent voice loss, social invisibility overcome only through invention). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each heat-mapped memory layers emotional density until the lullaby breakthrough crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; the conservatory’s stasis becomes the pressure chamber for transformation. Cost is legible in Lirael’s “gratitude” for the capsize—a reweighting only possible after enduring its erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias chooses to stay, foreclosing his former life with visible cost (“traded his shovel for a quill”). The drive lens is Causal—each beat follows because/therefore (dream → voyage → repair → activation → stay). Cost is legible in the final image: two aged figures in a thriving library, the lens now broadcasting belonging. Orientation anchors immediately (“undertaker… doorstep… crate”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pattern (anonymous aid → named reciprocity) taught early and broken decisively at the solstice gathering. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the community shifts from hidden interdependence to declared kinship, with cost legible in the cessation of anonymous donations and the vulnerability of public need. The “amplified quiet” evolves from oppressive silence to shared language, satisfying Conceptual Repricing. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate and sustained.

The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern intensification (chalk codes → fountain light → microchip) culminating in the hologram. Cost is legible in Lira’s tears and the irreversible commitment to continue her grandmother’s work. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact despite coincidence (the carrier’s timing), which complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (flame, silk, stars) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy chart transforms from decorative artifact to living map when illuminated. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt observatory, autumn winds”), and the closure—a shimmering reconfiguration of the spiral into a straight line—carries conceptual cost: truth is legible only through sacrifice of surface appearance. The eternal flame’s role as synchronizer pays off cohesively, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lirael exits with clarified stance (“Go. Live. Speak”) and visible cost—the unsent letters now integrated, not erased. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spirits’ songs intensify, condensation forms words, moonlight fades—all deepening the dominant stake without causal turns. Cost is legible in the shard’s transformation (sharp → smooth) and her lighter steps. Orientation anchors instantly (“mangrove labyrinth,” “Lirael,” “moonlight”).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lira redefines translation as alchemy, crystallized when she places the coral on the negotiating table—“This grew from ruin. So can we.” Cost is legible in the scarred general’s hesitant touch and the lingering ache now “lighter, a seed waiting to sprout.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, coral, cast, and translations accrue density until the final image reweights all prior fragments. No causality breaks; disorientation from anesthetic serves thematic blurring then resolves into clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory fragments, communal memory, and light-painting until the fresco fragment becomes a catalyst for resurrection. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard shifts from “lost” to “found,” with cost legible in Lira’s trembling hands and the fog’s retreat. Orientation is clear by line 30; pattern (fog → light → memory) taught early and paid off cohesively. The only flaw: slight vagueness in how the knowledge network functions, though it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory detail and conceptual echoes until the mural’s memory awakens—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence, restoration, and inheritance.

The nested structure (“awakenings within awakenings”) pays off cleanly without retroactive patches. Orientation is immediate and sustained, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered patterns (Fibonacci gardens, QR-code moths, fractal seeds) until the glowing “RESIST” mosaic crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the secret language becomes visible, reweighting surveillance vs. resistance with social cost implied by media buzz. The greenhouse-to-garden transition is smooth, and the final image (“defiant pulse in the heart of the city”) delivers earned resonance. Minor deduction: the club’s acceptance feels slightly abrupt, lacking a decisive test beyond moth-swarming.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s insomnia ends not through cure but surrender to coexistence—pain and beauty no longer at war. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via recurring motifs (wind, lullabies, moss) that reweight the stake by the final image. Cost is legible: centuries of vigilance relinquished for fragile song. The shell’s migration frames a coherent before/after, and the postcard’s disappearance proves price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chime’s crack becomes a conduit, not a flaw, reweighting preservation as collaborative evolution. Cost is legible in the director’s flickering doubt and Lirael’s unspoken grief for lost names. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density and cadence shifts (humming → singing → silence → new harmony). Every beat tightens pressure toward the charged final image of rainbows cast by remade sound.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each discovery (“Gwennol” river → Cadogan mill → mead recipes → wedding vows) logically tightens the path toward understanding trust as linguistic vulnerability. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: “Even when we’re silent, our hearts speak in the language of belonging” reweights Elara’s entire arc, making silence itself legible as communication. The cost—years of estrangement—is crystallized in the final call, where Elara chooses vulnerability over archival safety. Orientation is immediate (archive, linguist, sister conflict), and the single transition (night to dawn) serves the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)

Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality isn’t linear but pattern-coherent. Cost is legible in the line: “I fear my heart will break, but I trust you to mend it.”

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walks toward Dr. Voss, the meteorite in his pocket, the echo humming in his veins—options crystallized, cost felt (abandoned courier life, confronting buried truth). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered echoes—song, dust, ledger, dream—until the map emerges from chaos. Every beat links via pattern accrual, not causality, yet the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable weight. The “space between” revelation pays off the taught motif without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: thresholds are redefined not as places but as acts of crossing, with the cost being Lira’s permanent relinquishment of the past. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through patterned sensory and symbolic density (prisms, grain, codes) that culminates in a charged final image. Orientation is immediate and functional; disorientation serves the mirage-like terrace and pays off at closure. Every beat tightens the thematic spiral toward the decisive act of stepping through.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: bioluminescent pulses intensify via pattern density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where “belonging” is redefined as participation rather than place. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“forgotten underwater city research facility… pressure of the sea pressed like a gentle hand”).

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira crystallizes her role as conductor of chaos, transforming the arcade into an impromptu ensemble. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density and rhythmic shifts until the fountain’s flare triggers collective realignment. Cost is conceptual: she foregoes solo performance for communal improvisation, visible in the crowd’s unified drift. Orientation is immediate (“tidal arcade,” “Lira,” “violin”) and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lirael endures elective exile, foreclosing rebellion but affirming her dual nature, with visible cost (verse fades by dawn, ban remains). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases through sensory layering, cadence shifts at climax, and the garden’s retreat reweights the stake. Cost is legible in “her heart full of obsidian grace”—a resonant, constrained stance. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered sensory detail and refracted light imagery until the mist thins into clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant reframed from external pact to self-binding via curiosity, with visible cost in relinquished certainty. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of symbolic detail (reliefs, tiles, constellations) intensifies until the final reweighting. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality holds through Elara’s active decoding. The wall’s tremors and voice serve pattern payoff, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: each visitor deepens the pattern of release-through-mending, culminating in Kael’s fragile smile as Charged Poise closure. Reality’s shifting backdrop and the pin’s reappearance create a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the lesson won’t last, but “for now… that was enough.” However, the mosaic structure (four+ visitors) isn’t fully taught by 25%; transitions blur individual stakes, and the sanctuary’s rules (e.g., pin vanishing/reappearing) lack consistent mechanics, slightly muddying causality. Still, the ending image legibly reweights the premise: grace is temporary, scarred, and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines his mirrors not as erasers of boundaries but as navigational tools, with cost legible in the reversed sextant and inward-pointing needle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through frost, breath, glass—and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: inheritance redefined as active choice, not lineage, with legible cost—Elara surrenders museum credibility (“They’ll never believe me”) to claim her place in the orchard’s continuum. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: swirling patterns, shifting shells, and fractal cameos build density until the bark-fusion crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; causality remains intact despite nonlinear conceit because rules are dramatized early (singed letter, pulsing soil). Final chime and glowing blossoms provide resonant payoff without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: each beat logically triggers the next (“because she understood the cipher’s gaps, therefore she hummed the tune”).

Cost is legible—the chamber vanishes, leaving only Elara’s copied knowledge and altered self-conception. The causal lens holds: each step (seal → rope → door) follows from prior logic. Orientation is immediate (“clock tower’s mechanism room”), and the single shard structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the caves regain balance not by banishing the energy beings but by integrating their noise into a new equilibrium—“a duet of hush and hum.” Cost is legible in the mapkeeper’s physical pain (“ribs ache,” “teeth ached”) and emotional labor, paid before the bloom manifests. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: pressure escalates via sensory density (static → hum → tidal wave of noise) until the spiral’s activation triggers a cadence shift into lullaby. Every story beat tightens around the central act of listening-as-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s true purpose shifts from navigation to existential reminder, reweighting all prior effort.

Cost is legible in evaporated puddles (lost rain-memory) and the forecourt’s lingering hum—what remains is transformed relationship to time. Orientation anchors instantly: “summer-quill archivist,” “observatory above clouds,” post-fog-solidification.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “shadows” redefined as unlit potential, with Lira’s self-forgiveness crystallized in the blooming chamber. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the fortress’s glow intensifies through sensory density until the chain-reaction bloom reweights her failure as fuel. Cost is legible in her raw laugh and the vanished mentor’s absence; the knot’s warmth evolves into active ignition. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3, and the mosaic note tightens stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic recurrence until the final Charged Poise: Elara’s reframing of transition via the cicada crystallizes stakes without resolving the conflict outright.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara crosses a psychological threshold by inviting Kael in, reconfiguring her stance from solitary guardian to collaborative keeper. Cost is legible—the sanctuary shudders, thresholds pulse, and she admits error (“I was wrong”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated sensory motifs (ash, starlight, scars) intensify until the final image of shared breath. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality flows through embodied ritual (knocking → summoning → crossing).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with conceptual pressure building through sensory and linguistic density until the bolt-turn dissolves diamonds into mist—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights “pressure” as metaphor.

The spiral anomaly triggers a decisive intensification that narrows no options but reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vase shard shifts from symbol of destruction to map of buried truth, reweighting the Luminari myth with undeniable social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (shard, fungi, mirrors) until the storm vision crystallizes meaning. Causality holds via Kael’s plan → storm → bloom → revelation; each beat tightens pressure without coincidence. Cost is felt in his heretic status and the irreversible exposure of historical fraud.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the box wasn’t broken but “distracted,” reweighting the entire premise with emotional cost legible in Lira’s admission and the stone’s flare. Orientation is immediate (Elias in resonance chamber by line 3), and causality holds under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative (sound thickening into syrup) fused with Causal (truth realigns purpose). The covenant’s creed pays off structurally, not just thematically. Cost is crystallized in Lira’s confession: “He left me to face the debts alone.”

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until the lagoon’s hum reweights everything.

Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 30, and the compass’s arc pays off without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with layered imagery intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: Lira reinterprets the island as a tapestry, not a labyrinth. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“storm-tossed archway,” “Lira,” “after the GPS failed”), and disorientation serves closure. The archway transition functions as a taught pattern payoff, not a causal break. Cost is legible in the final image—her art now carries temporal weight, foreclosing naive creation for guardian duty.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns deepen through light shifts on etched glass, postcards, and seasonal transitions, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—flowers bloom not in defiance but “in communion” with the hush. Orientation is immediate (“amber pavilion,” “autumn leaves,” “Mara… knelt”), and the closure lands as Charged Poise: the window’s final layer remains “etched but unbroken,” crystallizing stakes (mystery as ongoing practice) with conceptual cost (truth deferred, not possessed). The “dawning hush” functions as both temporal compass and thematic pivot, tightening pressure without causal linearity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara accepts partial loss (blank diary, delayed truth) to foreclose immediate erasure, crystallizing Charged Poise at dawn’s edge. The Causal lens holds tightly—each beat follows because/therefore logic (diary → lagoon → tunnels → trapdoor). Cost is legible in the blank pages and Mara’s exhausted emergence. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the cove revives not physically but through collective memory made visible, with the amber bottle as lens. Cost is legible in Elias’s tears mixing with salt spray—emotional toll of carrying remembrance. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via density of recovered artifacts and intensifying sensory echoes until the lanterns brighten and ghosts materialize. No causality breaks; every turn stems from Elias’s sustained attention and micro-choices (scavenging, arranging, focusing).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sound, memory, and botanical imagery until the harmonic hum beneath the shriek reweights everything. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the “accidental prophecy” reframed as awakening, not doom, with clear cost—Voss accepts he cannot prevent but must witness. The foghorn’s silence functions as both temporal anchor and thematic pivot, and the phonograph replay serves as the single, necessary tightening that crystallizes meaning. Every beat feeds the final reconfiguration without causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sapling reweights the vortex inheritance from abstract duty to tangible renewal, with felt cost in the melting ice and shattered diamond dust. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through spirals, seeds, light—culminating in a cadence shift at “Now.” Orientation is immediate (“icebound atrium… Lirael Veyra knelt”), and the egg’s hatching provides a live clock that tightens decisions without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative/Textural in its atmospheric buildup, Causal in Lira’s interventions—and sustains it coherently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the solstice hush returns, but now harmonized by Lira’s attunement, with visible cost in her aching arms and altered relationship to the sanctuary. The bell’s tone shift triggers a decisive chain: agitation → recognition → recalibration. Every beat links because/therefore, and the sundial anchors time without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through recurring images (lantern, stardust, stillness) until the final speck of stardust reweights everything. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Zara’s stance crystallizes in the final exchange, foreclosing scientific compliance in favor of spiritual attunement, with conceptual cost legible in Veyra’s cracked facade. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single transition (station to crater and back) is seamless. The only hairline flaw: time blurring (“hours or minutes”) slightly mutes pressure but serves theme.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who: Elias; where: abandoned beekeeping oasis; when: post-collapse, after ghosts appear) within 60 words. It follows Track A defaults cleanly—single POV, one scene, two characters (Elias + ghosts as collective). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): silence is renounced, ghosts fade, and the box shatters, marking a decisive before/after. Cost is felt—the decades of burden lifted—but the causal chain leans slightly on supernatural revelation rather than strictly character-driven pressure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time’s “true shape” is redefined not as measurement but as a mosaic of fragile, infinite moments—charged by the reappearance of his wife’s laugh. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via object descriptions that layer meaning. Cost is legible in Elias leaving the urn fragment behind—a tangible forfeiture. Orientation is sharp by line 30, and the silo’s logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern (storm debris → tapestry → dissolution), culminating in Conceptual Repricing—beauty as process, not permanence. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the woven dawns *will* unravel, yet Lira affirms creation anyway. The kite string’s snap initiates the cycle, and the drake feather’s resonance ties memory to action. Every beat feeds the final reconfiguration without causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s death is foreclosed by her choice to stay, with visible cost (“six months left”) crystallized in the final image of her breath held by the orchard. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (copper’s gleam, stone’s hum) until the dusk climax reweights harmony as shared language. Every beat links through “because” logic (e.g., wire wrapping → pillar warmth → spirit appearance), and the Orientation Test is waived by early, vivid anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the sculpture path, amber, and “bronze quiet” layering toward a Conceptual Repricing: homecoming as self-recognition, not chemical replication. Orientation is immediate—Lirael at the tower’s base in spring drizzle—and the closure lands with felt cost (her buried longing resurfaces). The amber’s dissolution triggers a resonant reconfiguration, not a mechanical payoff, and the final creaking door implies consequence without over-resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jetty garden’s fragile bloom crystallizes hope amid ruin, with conceptual cost (the dead reef, lost languages) legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory layering, bird calls, and seed-scattering until twilight deepens into indigo and storm gathers. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. Cost is undeniable: “fertilizer mixed from memories of the reef’s final gasp” ties loss directly to rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered riddles that reweight the settlement’s understanding of memory, connection, and history. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: “love” as what grows when shared reframes all prior artifacts. Cost is legible in the communal shift from silence to murmur—felt, not stated. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the phonograph-to-leaf pattern pays off cohesively at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail, recurring motifs, and temporal distortion until the “glimpse” crystallizes into a Conceptual Repricing: confusion redefined as exploration. Orientation is immediate (“time dilation observation deck,” “Elio Voss,” “after the shutdown”), and the closure lands as Charged Poise—Elio steps into light, quill ready, with visible cost (exile, solitude, smudged ink). The compass needle’s reorientation embodies a before/after legible without dialogue or action beyond choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each chess piece swap directly alters the spire’s stability, culminating in a Decisive Change when the king is replaced and the sky clears. Orientation is immediate (“icebound spire,” “Kael… crept”), stakes are concrete (prevent collapse of Aetheria), and escalation tightens logically—from pawn to king—with rising physical consequences (groans → tremors → violent shaking).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Home isn’t a place… but the shape of what you carry,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost (the stone shatters, embedding in her skin). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring images (feather, mercury skin, stone) until the cadence shift at the climax dissolves the bookstore into the cavern. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyric compression. Cost is legible in the final image: Lirael’s hands flecked with obsidian, the feather dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Alaric accepts his failure as part of a larger corruption, reweighting his self-blame into wisdom. The causal lens holds—each action (tracing threads, entering labyrinth) directly enables the next, culminating in the woven hush that unfreezes time. Cost is legible: he forfeits the illusion of total control, symbolized by the fading platinum lines. The thunder’s lull-to-fade cadence tightens pressure without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (bone towers, spire, echoes) until the climactic light burst reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “scars could be maps too—if you measured them just right” reweights the crash’s devastation into reconstructive possibility, with clear conceptual cost (decades of lost wealth, fractured elite). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (tape, rain, cards), culminating in dawn’s “bleed” that crystallizes the loft as archive. Orientation is immediate (“rain-beaded skylight loft”), and the single scene tightens through Mara’s arrival, forcing Elara to demonstrate her method. Cost is legible in the tape’s hiss rewinding—a sound that embodies labor over hope.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory layering and conceptual recurrence (“atoms of nostalgia,” “avoiding patterns”), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the archive transforms from tomb to seed. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands with undeniable cost—the loss of innocence, Kael’s departure, Lirael’s embrace of uncertainty. The resonant reconfiguration (“past as choice”) carries emotional and intellectual weight without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): hope regains shape via Lirael’s spoken word, with conceptual cost legible in the shadow’s fragility (“one wrong move, and it’ll shatter—along with hope itself”). The Causal lens holds—each beat links by “because/therefore”: stone shifts → she investigates footage → superimposes images → speaks the word. The river stone’s transformation from artifact to key drives the decisive change, and the library’s rearranged books show irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira’s reconstructed tail reweights her moral compass under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in her shed guilt and recalibrated purpose. Orientation is clear by line 3; the misty workshop, starlight, and con backstory anchor time/place/motive. The single meaningful deepening—linking chameleon’s survival tactic to her own transformation—tightens stakes coherently. No causality breaks; the reflective block is anchored to the tail and alters present action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mara reinterprets scars not as maps of loss but as bridges to understanding, with tangible cost—the raw vulnerability of reliving her mother’s death. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with coffee rings functioning as a taught pattern that deepens meaning beat by beat. The tunnel sequence escalates pressure coherently, each vision tightening emotional stakes until the final reconfiguration. Dawn light and melted frost crystallize Charged Poise without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s decision to carry the film strip reconfigures the Alhambra from tomb to archive, with emotional cost legible in her trembling hands and tears. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (rain, lilacs, flickering bulb), culminating in a cadence shift when the crystal flares. Orientation is immediate (“projection booth of the old Alhambra Theater”), and causality flows through psychometric contact, not coincidence. The snapped film-to-black beat mirrors Elise’s rupture, making past/present stakes inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (stardust, aurora, sextant), and lyrical cadence build to a Conceptual Repricing—creativity as dormant, not lost. Orientation is clear by line 30 (Kael at archway, night, sextant). The chamber reveal and stardust ingestion form a coherent escalation that reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael stands renewed, mind buzzing, choosing to chase auroras again—foreclosing passive despair with visible cost (years of smog-choked stagnation) now transcended.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s act reweights the archive’s purpose from storage to cultivation, with visible cost (the fading sparks) and earned change (he dreams). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds sensory density until the dune’s glow “seeps into his skin,” triggering collapse into white light. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality holds via symbolic logic internal to the world. The frozen clock’s resolution ties directly to the inciting object with no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the forest reweights from machine to brain, then to living organism, with the gear revealed as seed—not key. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquishment and the forest’s exhale. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, escalating via sensory density (ironwoods’ lament → bioluminescent moss) rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vigil continues, but Jorin now sees courage as iterative choice, not destination.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elric’s voice redefines safety, foreclosing his old silence with tangible cost (dimmed walls, strained healers). The causal chain—neglected bolt → scream → spiral staircase insight → spoken truth—is tight and motivated. The cobalt fortress’s rules hold, and the final image (child playing) reweights prior silence into active hope. Cost is legible in the “frostbitten hope” that thaws the walls.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the throne is revealed empty, courtiers bow in recognition, and Veyra claims heirship without violence. Cost is conceptual—centuries of deceit dissolved, legitimacy restored through truth alone. The Causal lens holds: each step (messages → ink → convergence → trapdoor → sundering) links via “because/therefore.” Constellations’ pause functions as both clock and key, shaping tactics with irreplaceable timing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned repetition (tapping, atlas, bleaching) building toward a Conceptual Repricing: the ocean isn’t healing linearly but cycling through realities. Closure lands via Charged Poise—their departure reconfigures the atoll’s meaning, with cost implied in the abandoned station. The storm revelation is earned through prior data assembly, not coincidence. Orientation is clear by line 3; lens holds coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)

Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory density and symbolic layering rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: reality is rewoven, not repaired, with the final image (“we’re all just waiting to be rewoven”) reweighting every prior fragment. Cost is legible—the abandonment of control, the surrender to chaos-as-material—and the lighthouse’s hollow lens mirrors Elias’s internal void now charged with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sensory and conceptual patterns that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: time fragments, doesn’t slow. The closure—a Charged Poise as Lira steps into the tower—is earned by prior beats (ink patterns, child’s circles, hologram) and carries undeniable cost: the risk of vanishing like her brother. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality is maintained through symbolic but consistent rules. The final image reconfigures the entire premise with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: Lirael’s discovery → decision → awakening → alliance. Closure is a Charged Poise—truth is released, Council pursuit looms, cost is felt but not yet paid. However, the “within the blink that follows surprise” time cue isn’t dramatized as a constraint; it’s decorative. Cost is legible (her archival sanctity sacrificed), but the tightening is modest for elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs—sand, quiet, the dome—that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence as active focus, not absence. Orientation is immediate (“beneath the glass dome,” “desert rose,” “Lira”), and the closure lands with undeniable cost: she inherits not just a farm but a revolution of meaning, foreclosing violence permanently. The ballast scrap’s burial enacts Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes options without action yet radiates irreversible commitment. Every shard of memory serves the ending’s reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dissonance intensifies into static, then resolves through Kael’s ritualized action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the garden stabilizes, constellations freeze, but the goddess is lost, her essence absorbed into the soil. Cost is legible in the shimmering earth and Kael’s slumped posture. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; every beat tightens the pattern toward its breaking point and reintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara’s final stance—dancing in the gravity of regret while writing op-eds—reconfigures her family’s legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal drive lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (call → search → discovery → exposure).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: guilt dissolves into understanding, dissonance ceases, and the amber dims—charging the final image with conceptual cost (silenced cries now heard). The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (amber pulses → firmware restless → letters retrieved → nursery entered → letter read → code rewrites). Orientation is immediate (“laboratory of lost sounds,” “Lira Voss”), and the single transition (into firmware memory) is legible. Cost is unmistakable: Lira must relive her trauma to heal collective dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (mist, glow, sand, hum) intensifies until the mandala triggers a Conceptual Repricing—the emergent hush is revealed as language. Orientation is immediate (“grotto,” “Mara,” “tile flake”), and closure lands via CR with conceptual cost (truth requires collaboration, not solitary art). The sand mandala’s transformation and bell toll reweight all prior silence as meaningful. One flaw: the directive “Interject” arrives without clear causal setup, leaning slightly on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs, and cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake—renaming through remembrance—with conceptual cost.

Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden converges, timelines knit, and Elias fades—but the blank tarot coin and lingering applause reconfigure possibility as collective, not personal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with echoes thickening into a chorus that reweights stakes via cadence shift and density increase. Cost is legible in the final image: Elias’s form dissolves despite success, proving reconciliation demands sacrifice. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (“orchard garden,” “stage ghost,” “after business closed”).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: the static shock *because* it altered Elias’s perception *therefore* he devises a new method. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias and Mara commit to showing the world an alternative, foreclosing the corporate path with visible cost (no refunds, no therapy). The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (neon-blue light, static aftermath) pays off in the geode’s alignment climax. Cost is legible in the neural map’s “constellations” and the warmth of the geode against his palm—a physicalized price for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)

Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The future is a tapestry woven from the threads of the past” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—prophecy is not fate but raw material. The hourglass’s sand, the buttons, the jar all accumulate meaning that crystallizes in the final image without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara doesn’t recover her father or solve the mystery, but reconfigures her relationship to courage, choosing action despite fear. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered imagery (mist, snow, engraving, ink) that culminates in the soil transcription, a temporary act that embodies thematic stakes. Cost is legible: she risks exposure, trusts no one, and accepts that truth is transient. Orientation is immediate (“At the tilt of the earth… Zephyr Bluff”), and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with fog, needle, river, and ticking gutters layering meaning toward a Conceptual Repricing: the palimpsest promise is not about passage but about stripping noise to reveal essence. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Thaddeus stepping ashore as rain begins, the promise “safe” in shared silence—carrying conceptual cost (endless waiting, unspoken burdens). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact through sensory accumulation rather than plot mechanics. A hairline slip: the rain gutters’ “ticking” resolves too neatly without prior sonic buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the oasis isn’t resisting change but choosing which timeline to nurture—a reframing that reweights every prior image with cost (the loss of other timelines). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via phototropic motifs until the thrumming climax fractures perception. Cost is legible in the final image—Mara carries warmth but leaves behind all other possible pasts. Orientation is crisp by line 30; causality remains intact despite nonlinear vision.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara opens the shutter and closes her eyes, letting moonlight in—a legible reconfiguration where vulnerability becomes possible, with the cost being years of sealed-off grief now exposed. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: rhythm, recurrence (petal → stem → bloom; gauge taps → oar rhythm), and sensory layering intensify until the final image reweights the entire premise. The rosebush waiting for spring ties back to Elias’s opening gesture, creating a resonant loop with emotional consequence. No causality breaks; every beat accrues meaning toward the ending’s quiet transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating sensory and emotional density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: Lirael redefines survival as independence, not reincarnation or remembrance. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—the library stilled, the spiral symbol, the new book—making a before/after legible with conceptual cost (she forgoes ancestral chorus for authorship). Orientation is immediate and vivid (“tidal library above clouds…”), and the pattern of tidal shifts, hum, and reflection is taught early and paid off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and symbolic density building toward a Conceptual Repricing: secrets must be shared to reconnect. The closure—Lila dissolving her secret into the pond and resolving to change her practice—is resonant and legible, with cost implied in her vulnerability and tears.

Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal + Accumulative/Textural), with clear because/therefore links: compass guides → organ activates → vision appears → corridor twists → compass stabs wall → key yields. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps into the unknown, the nexus transformed from prison to gateway, with felt cost in sustained dread and physical strain. The starlight motif anchors orientation early and recharges at closure. One tightening—spatial mutiny forcing a tactical shift—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (ribbon, mist, stone) until the locket’s discovery crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Lila shifts from cold-case statistic to humanized presence, with cost felt in Clara’s tightened throat and Voss’s weary resolve. Orientation is immediate (“quarry,” “Clara,” “ribbon”), and causality remains intact despite lyric pacing. The handprint beat tightens options without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s stance on the roof crystallizes options (“some truths were worth the risk”) with undeniable cost (abandoning evacuation, risking disaster).

Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the flickering station lights.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (flake, fiddle, scaffold flutters), and cadence shift cohere into a Charged Poise closure—Elias stands ready to play, options reconfigured, cost felt in the loss of the “never.” Orientation is immediate (mountain pullout, van, hitchhiker vanished), and the transition to the new space is earned through musical ritual. The flake’s transformation and Marisol’s reappearance deliver a Conceptual Repricing with legible cost: the pixelated amnesty demands active participation, not passive discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (foreign bills, circling paths) that culminate in Conceptual Repricing: greed’s futility is reweighted via symbolic artifacts. Orientation is immediate and sustained; closure lands with Earned Stasis—Elias forecloses his father’s path by transforming stolen currency into moral talismans. Cost is legible in his solitude and the weight of memory, though the startup founders’ off-page unraveling slightly softens on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirael’s understanding shifts from decoding inscriptions as puzzles to receiving them as shared burdens, crystallizing in the glyph-map of empathy and the skin-etched lullaby.

    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with escalating sensory and symbolic density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant becomes internal, not external. Closure is decisive—the labyrinth vanishes, scars glow, two moons appear—and carries clear conceptual cost (loss of old identity, acceptance of dual-world pain). Orientation is immediate (“cobalt glade at dusk,” “Lirael… knelt”), and causality holds: every vision and scar-pulse stems from prior action. The only hairline slip is the slightly abrupt throne dissolution, but it doesn’t undermine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirael emerges not “healed” but reconfigured, her soul patched yet still idealistic, now guided by earned doubt. The cost is legible—the burned Fool card, the memory of the boy reframed as lesson—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: meaning accrues through sensory density (bioluminescent fungi, pulsing fruit) and ritual action (sewing), culminating in a vision that reweights her past. The orchard’s rules are consistent, and the keeper’s bargain pays off causally within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory detail (mildew, dynamite echoes, gold-crimson threads) deepens Lenny’s emotional stasis until the phoenix logo triggers reconfiguration.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening through recurring motifs (scallop, hairpin, climbing) that coalesce into a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lirael’s realization that contentment is a practice, not a destination. The closure image—Lirael at peace in the vineyard hush with the hairpin restored—carries conceptual cost: years of isolation, broken trust, and emotional labor. Backstory is anchored by present stimuli (the shell triggers memory), and the single transition (tree perch to ground and back) is clean. Orientation is immediate and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s removal of the maple chime crystallizes agency, reconfiguring doubt from haunting to harmony, with emotional cost legible in her frayed voice and hardened resolve.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via coins, static, holograms until the spiral vision coalesces. Orientation anchors immediately (“ambered observatory deck… Kael”), and the single scene tightens meaningfully toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “We are the tide that drowns the unspoken” reweights silence as complicity, with cost legible in Elias’s “ache of knowing.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (light, whispers, temperature), culminating in a cadence shift at the climax. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when echoes coalesce into agency-altering knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rift stitches shut, the bell works imperfectly, and Elias accepts ongoing labor—foreclosing easy resolution with felt cost (“constant adjustment”). The Causal lens holds: because the bell’s drip syncs with the viaduct’s hum, therefore harmony returns. Orientation anchors instantly (“sapphire viaduct,” “Elias,” “dawn”), and the drip-rate logic drives every beat. Cost is legible in Elias’s shaking hands and the bell’s widening cracks—physical stakes earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town resurfaces not in stone but in stories, reweighting memory as communal act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (label, photos, liqueur) until the final trail crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each action triggers a reaction (Kael’s energy surge → clone’s counter → brain flickers → merger). Closure is a Decisive Change—Kael absorbs the clone, achieving Earned Stasis by rejecting fear’s version of himself. Cost is legible: emotional rawness replaces numbness, and the silent brain signifies irreversible loss. Orientation is immediate (“floating rock dojo,” “swirling vortex”), and the single-scene shard fits 600–800-word scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the key redefines “escape” as organic emergence rather than mechanical unlocking, with cost implied in Elias’s relinquished control. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the spiral motif, seed-to-key transformation, and brook setting accrue meaning without causal linearity. Orientation is clear by line 30; the envelope’s watermark seeds the payoff. Cost is legible in the final image: the world shifts because Elias accepts mystery over mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)

Cost is legible in final tremors and quiet hum of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias doesn’t relight the lamp but sustains its purpose through ritual, foreclosing mechanical restoration in favor of communal endurance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—each note deepens the pattern, culminating in a final image where connection replaces flame. Cost is legible: the ache of darkness remains, but now carries meaning. The sea glass’s hum and vanished stones provide motivated ellipsis that tightens stakes without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dawn redefined as a “choice,” not just a time, with undeniable conceptual cost (the burden of shaping futures alone). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through shadow imagery, cadence shifts at the climax (“world inside the glass went white”), and stakes reweight via color mosaic. Orientation is immediate (emerald lighthouse, cliff, stars), and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly. Cost is legible in the final image: her smallness against cosmic responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light patterns, the wing’s iridescence, and Lin’s perception deepen until the wing vanishes, triggering a Conceptual Repricing—she now sees stories as light-refracted phenomena.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (bread, seeds, saplings) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: creeping normality is reframed not as loss but as a map to hidden sanctity. Closure lands decisively with the sunflower seed replacing the vanished bread—a resonant reconfiguration charged with conceptual cost (the bakery is gone, but growth persists). Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Elias,” “streetlights,” “autumn”), and the single transition (tea house → courtyard) tightens pressure coherently. The final image crystallizes stakes without exposition, fulfilling Charged Poise with undeniable emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures, reconstructs vows, and briefly reignites the library’s magic—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (exhaustion, near-failure). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: pressure builds through fading light, static, and narrowing time, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. The final image reweights the premise—meaning persists through labor, not permanence—with conceptual cost (knowledge remains fragile). One tightening (the incomplete vow) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira destroys the device, accepting the loss of her father’s last token to uphold “hush,” with cracked glass symbolizing irreversible cost. The causal chain holds—each false start tightens pressure, culminating in a midnight deadline that forces decisive action. Orientation is immediate (pier, tide, lanterns), and the drive lens (Causal) is clear by midpoint and sustained. The only hairline flaw: the lisp-man’s sudden recognition feels slightly convenient but doesn’t break escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara-7 achieves Earned Stasis by integrating her fears, foreclosing the path of suppression at the cost of permanent static—but now it sings. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: magnetic drift intensifies sensory and emotional density until the box’s fraying seals catalyze the climax. Cost is legible in the line “her joints still ached, and the static wasn’t entirely gone—but fragmented wholeness.” Orientation anchors instantly (“desert rose farm under the glass dome”), and causality flows through embodied pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Clara’s listening leads to gathered lore, which yields the combination, which opens the mailbox. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Clara Voss,” “Willowbrook Thrift Shop,” “dawn”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the mailbox’s secret reframes love as enduring beyond death—and cost is legible in the soldier’s unfinished letter and Clara’s tears. The locket-to-mailbox causality is tight, though the triple-date combo risks slight contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: vulnerability redefined as strength through lived action, not theory. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (dice, dance, web) that culminate in Charged Poise.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (coin, sand, scars) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: compassion as carrying weight, not erasing it. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the black sand grain released into the lagoon symbolizes acceptance of unchangeable past. The structure is taut, one continuous scene with no orientation drift; every beat deepens the central tension without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s fountains roar back to life, memories liberated, while Lira walks away with an empty box—a Charged Poise where defiance meets earned stasis. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: each breadcrumb intensifies the hum, deepens color, and tightens the pattern toward eruption. Cost is legible in raw fingers and the skeptic’s unresolved doubt. The “pause of migrating geese” frames time poetically but doesn’t pressure decisions—minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pinging intensifies, petals fall faster, light patterns converge, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—“generational patterns aren’t chains but bridges.” Orientation is immediate (“Lumin stood beneath a canopy…”), causality flows through sensory escalation rather than plot mechanics, and closure lands with undeniable cost: the gear left behind symbolizes relinquishing control for trust. The ghost’s appearance functions as resonant echo, not deus ex machina, because the garden’s sonar has primed supernatural communion from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: grief redefined as a “door,” not a “hole,” with visible cost in Marlow’s prior silence and isolation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via ancestral stories, butterfly migration, and ribbon imagery—culminating in a Charged Poise where options (to speak or stay silent) are crystallized. Orientation is immediate (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”), and the final image (faded but vibrant ribbon) legibly bears emotional cost. Minor deduction for the voice’s near-expository clarity, which risks feeling engineered rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lirael restores balance not by restarting the machine but by accepting incremental absolution as method, foreclosing any future reliance on pure mechanics. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory and symbolic density (obsidian, tide, runes), culminating in a cadence shift when the bob stirs “not in a sudden jerk but a slow, deliberate arc.” Cost is legible in her “raw” hands and the villagers’ relieved faces. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (fractured reflection) pays off in the closure’s reconfiguration of self and world.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets silence not as absence but as “echoes” carried through time—a legible before/after with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dust, mist, glow) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: “the dust itself would stir and listen.” Cost is legible in Lira’s physical tremors, the fading signal, and the pooled cloak—symbols of effort and sacrifice. Orientation is anchored immediately (“ember alcove,” “Lira,” “shortwave radio”), and the closure crystallizes her stance without tidy resolution. The broadcast’s ephemerality and her transcription ritual form a coherent pressure arc that tightens via cadence shift from hum to dirge to static.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ash, absence, and perception until the final Charged Poise: Lira walks out, leaving the portrait to vanish. Cost is legible in her smudged hands, the biting mask, and the gallery’s inevitable erasure—everything matters precisely because it won’t last. The rocking chair’s opening and closing bookend a resonant reconfiguration where endurance becomes art.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
