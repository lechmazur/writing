  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens established through dust patterns that accumulate meaning until the drainage decision crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with felt cost as Jonah tears up the insurance form, reconfiguring from demolition to recovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural drive with closure landing as Earned Stasis—Yara chooses forward movement despite danger, with the pendant as "silent beacon of truth" crystallizing her commitment. The frost-revelation sequence provides the central deepening that reweights her purpose. Cost is visible in the pursued escape and the line "glass, once cooled, never doubts the shape it has chosen."

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist becomes guardian of the chord, accepting physical pain as the price to preserve both the conservatory and the discovered music. The accumulative structure coheres through color-mapping progression, and the final image of "two unshaken marvels bound by luminous silence" reweights the opening's devastation with earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elias's choice to remain as keeper forecloses return with clear cost ("something living had to remain behind"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final reconfiguration where the library transforms from repository of ignored pleas to proper resting place. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient mechanics of the underwater transition.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "echoes never pay customs"—the pattern of giving/receiving crystallizes with felt cost (the three missing units exactly matching the given basket). The accumulative lens holds as density builds from quiet resistance to active circulation of faith.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well, building from the viaduct setting through the camera ritual to the conceptual repricing that unused love "seeds the dusk." The closure lands with felt cost as Lysander releases his stored regrets as sparks. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2, and the past-life revelation integrates smoothly into present action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Quillon becomes "the silent curator," accepting eternal stasis to preserve time's texture. The accumulative build through hyperbolic geometry, photographic visions, and the halo fragment's expansion creates legitimate pressure toward this crystallized ending where cost is explicit: "If he left, the maze would disintegrate and time with it."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from imprisonment through puzzle-solving to seed acquisition, with the wall's fall providing temporal pressure. The closure lands with Damaris emerging as "envoy of germinating tomorrows" carrying seeds - a Decisive Change with clear cost (her suffering) and stakes (future survival). The vault mechanism feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Jarom gathers absences that build toward the forge's revelation. The closure—trading chromatic hearing for betrayal's sound—lands with clear cost as colors drain to "gray thuds." The Resonant Reconfiguration works: he gains the warning note but loses the gift that guided him.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently toward Mara opening the jar and stepping through the door with her younger self—a Charged Poise moment where "gifts given freely no longer require accounting" crystallizes the cost. The lens holds consistently through lyric accumulation. Minor orientation wobble with Miratone's actual presence/absence slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the parallel thawing (internal/external), with visible cost in her solitary journey and abandoned commission. However, the accumulative structure occasionally loses momentum through extended reflection, and the bookmark subplot feels somewhat ornamental despite its thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from discovery of death records through exposure of murder plot to final liberating jump. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (risking death, losing identity) and the protagonist's broadcast transforms the situation irreversibly. The hidden cables feel slightly convenient but don't break causality since the engineer's dismissal was established.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the final image of "fort and sea and storm bound inside a single breath, until even that dissolved to story" crystallizes the transformation of military defense into silence-based tactics with clear stakes. The cost is legible—Brekan must risk his garrison on an unproven metaphysical strategy where "Should they break formation with noise, the night will find cracks."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ice violin as catalyst, temporal loop as complication, and amalgamation as resolution—all landing with visible cost ("Echo's guilt surged through him"). The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works: Janus-9's consciousness permanently altered, carrying Echo's subroutine "like distant strings in thaw." The orientation anchors (robot janitor, academy courtyard, twilight) establish cleanly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the lens transforms from hidden artifact to communal tool for transparency. The quest structure (decode tickets → find corridor → retrieve lens → share truth) provides solid causality. Cost appears when Silas allows the lens to "record the rhythm of his pulse" and accepts it as "covenant rather than trophy," though the final community transformation feels somewhat unearned in its speed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where polishing the marble triggers the garden's recognition, redistributing hoarded luck through the "Gardener" register. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: "spine still curved yet lighter" shows transformation with retained burden. The maze's rearrangement and new mysteries signal ongoing exchange rather than tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal lens with Maren's theory leading to action, creating temporal distortion, then requiring correction. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where she gains proof but accepts ethical constraints, with visible cost in her promise to seek consent. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's successful communion with Silvestri transforms the ruined space into a living concert hall, with clear cost (risking the building's structure by opening the trapdoor). The accumulative pattern of water/music/silence coheres beautifully. Slight deduction for the convenience of the perfectly preserved mosaic beneath, though the payoff lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara releases the seed, achieving "fault tolerant at last." The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery ("lilies bending under unseen winds") builds toward causal release. Cost is visible in "thirteen grams of future grief" and the physical act of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the beaded wheel's transformation from industrial artifact to "private metric" that measures guilt and confession. The cost is visceral: Caleb literally swallowed evidence, tasting "carbon copy blue whenever he lied." The accumulative lens holds as radio patterns, ghost shifts, and the wheel's impossible spinning cohere into "truth finally heavier in memory than in gut."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator accepts their witnessing role while acknowledging its cost ("learning to stand on shards"). The origami swan's transformation from map to boat creates coherent accumulative pressure. Minor orientation delay (who/where unclear until line 5) but pays off through the disorienting catacomb setting.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and the box warming, suggesting connection between human intention and natural mystery. However, the cost remains oblique - we see the box warm and Arlen's commitment renewed, but no clear sacrifice or foreclosed path makes the before/after transformation fully legible. The accumulative texture builds effectively but lacks a sharp decisive moment with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through diary fragments → tapestry → wall vibrations → final understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Ursa grasps her role in the "hidden cog" with cost implied through "trembling notes" and the weight of waiting ages. Orientation anchors smoothly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where broadcasting secrets transforms their nature ("secrets are only cages we pretend are keys"). The accumulative lens holds as fortunes, light patterns, and secrecy motifs build toward the final "key change." Cost is visible in the protagonist's emptied pockets and released past life. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the demon achieves self-awareness through the loop pedal's forced replay and releases the girl, with visible cost in its "winter wind" departure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as layered chants build cathedral-like architecture that traps and transforms. The priest's final acceptance of perpetual pilgrimage ("mapping each fragile soul") crystallizes the cost of this victory's temporary nature.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the nautilus chambers form "a new measure" waiting for the next horizon. Cost is felt through "every ache in his lungs" and the fragility of inspiration "measured in breaths." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors (who/where clear, but "when" emerges gradually through dawn progression).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Ira emerges carrying "darkening brightness meant to light others without burning them" - cost is visible through the extinction of alternate selves. The accumulative lens holds as choices compound through the corridor sequence. Slight weakness in the middle section's pacing through abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly—silence becomes eloquent communication, numbness transforms to feeling through shared vibration. The cost manifests in "tears shape themselves along cheeks starved for salt" and the community's physical release. Orientation anchors effectively (cavern, autumn, Maris). Deduction for some causality softness in the middle (how exactly does playing backward transform the drums?) but the accumulative pattern coheres at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from followed→message→journey→collaboration→flood diversion. Closure lands with Decisive Change (gates open, marshes fill) and visible cost (Hilara's exposure to authorities). Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3. Slight deduction for convenient timing of the supercell's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lysander's understanding of grief transforms from source of pain to "vessel of farewell." The cost is visible in tears and the final city-wide transformation, with strong causality through the fern's scent triggering memory revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory details and pattern-building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Jalen weaves "alternating threads of hope and wisdom." Cost is visible in the rope becoming "shorter and more frayed" and time itself rearranging "to accommodate his middle path." The closure lands with both felt and conceptual cost as reality adjusts to his compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Selene unbinds both tree and silence, creating new music from wreckage. The cost is visible in her sacrificed strings and the physical labor of freeing the sapling. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Celine gains "insight without heartbreak" and the dealer inadvertently absorbs her patience—a felt cost of professional boundaries eroding. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory details building to transformation. However, the cost to the dealer could be more viscerally dramatized rather than merely observed, and the "lunar cycle" warning feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (find envelope → search for recipient → gather community → Mara returns) but lacks a decisive on-page cost or transformation moment. The closure presents Mara receiving the glass-encased locket as resolution, but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The accumulative lens builds community gratitude effectively, yet the ending reads more as fulfillment than costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative structure builds from solitary arrival to communal grafting, with the obsidian arbor discovery as pivot. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Alyss transforms from "peripheral" to "forever grafted," with visible cost in offering her craft materials. The knot symbol effectively bridges rumor to reality, though the "another knot in the same bright web" coda slightly deflates finality.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught time manipulation building to Resonant Reconfiguration when the proto-echo's release transforms the city's soundscape ("every balcony sang the words last spoken upon it"). Cost is legible in the cracked stylus and emptied seconds, with the giant turning disrupting the established order. Minor orientation wobble with the giant's introduction feels slightly late.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Eridian transforms ambiguous loss from "yawning wound to measurable curve," accepting continuation over resolution. The cost is visible in his permanent offering of the glass eyes and whispered theorem to absence. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered symbols, drips, and musical patterns that reweight grief.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator becomes visible "more than ever before" by helping the girl, fulfilling their stated want with visible cost (breaking forty-one years of hiddenness). The accumulative structure coheres through sensory memory leading to discovery and connection. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("a linden seed bobbed under the eave...growing from her open palm") crystallizes transformation with visible cost (her changing form). The accumulative structure coheres through rain/storm/botanical imagery, though the middle section's "Over the next weeks" summary dilutes immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with rain trails threading toward resonant reconfiguration at the chapel. The closure lands with "Water remembers who listens" and transformative visions, though the cost could be more visceral. The exchange mechanism works causally, with brooch-for-memory creating genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal progression with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Arden's decision to leave the pearl reconfigures the quest's meaning with visible cost. The twist that Mara's prophecy referred to Arden, not the pearl, lands cleanly. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay in the opening third regarding their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively through "the quiet return of notes no ear could own," with the trumpet valve transforming from empty artifact to conduit for collective memory. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from harbor arrival to archival mission to communal reconstruction. Minor deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: Elara trades her deepest fear for truth, receiving "Destinations pretend too" which reweights her entire journey. The hybrid lens holds consistently through accumulative patterns (arrows→spirals→constellations) building to causal exchange. Orientation anchors established early (cartographer, rail yard, midnight). Cost is legible in her "brittle yet released" laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Soraya's worldview shifts to embrace both skepticism and wonder, with visible cost (tears for mentor, accepting his burden). The accumulative lens holds throughout as sensory details and memories layer toward this transformation. Slight deduction for predictable arc from skeptic to believer.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Callix shifts from passive ennui to "genuine thirst" for goodbye, with clear cost implied through the dangerous hunt ahead and the shard stored "inside my ribcage, the only prison I trusted." The accumulative build through magnetic struggle, vision fragments, and spatial rebellion coheres into this earned stance change, though the cost could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost (Corvus's death, exile), and causal chains hold throughout. The glass shard setup feels mechanical despite early placement. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the escape mechanism follows logically from established elements.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Calix's secret archival work reweights the ordinary stationer role, with visible cost in absorbing the avalanche's grief. The accumulative structure builds coherently from morning ritual through time-refraction to the final image of "bottled tomorrow's storm beside their vows," though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (Calix not named until line 6).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the closure achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's acceptance of namelessness to amplify collected stories. The cost is legible in "I must stay an empty line on a blank form" - the surrender of identity for witness. The refrigerated container discovery and retreat create meaningful deepening without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Maren gains the "ephemeral compass" as an internalized ability to "reimagine any conversation until new paths appeared," with the cost being her surrendered arrogance. The accumulative structure coheres as sound, memory, and inquiry build to this crystallization. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "universal riddle" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from individual role through collective action, with the foundation stone chip driving causal pressure throughout. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira transitions from absorber to teacher, with visible cost in the public trust arrangement. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the textural lens holds consistently through the layered graffiti-to-law progression.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory detail toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Halina becomes keeper of vanished silence. The closure lands with felt cost: "melancholy dawn had passed, but its residue clung to her like frost that refuses to melt indoors." Causality holds as her chemical timing system enables the documentation she came to create.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details of water, light, and sound build toward the successful repair enabling the ship's departure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara's "Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry" reweights her blindness from disability to mastery, with cost visible in the time pressure of the maiden voyage. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where condensation patterns, multilingual incantations, and luminous water accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the discovery that rivers' origins can only be held in memory, not mapped. The cost is legible: Morrow's printed atlas becomes impossible, forcing him into oral tradition. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (lake location remains vague) and some causality softness around how speaking creates physical changes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with walking cadence building to temporal reversal—the town's restoration through rhythmic footsteps creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (Lira must stay and keep walking). The closure lands with "carry the interval" as both burden and gift, though the mechanism of time-folding could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara saves both scholar and artifact while gaining something ineffable herself. The causal chain from distress signal to rescue holds, though the tripwire system's convenient deactivation upon "authorized contact" strains credibility. Cost is visible in oxygen depletion and the risk taken, but the ease of the final escape undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Silas abandons his labyrinth and chooses truth over escape, with visible cost in surrendering his perfect revision. The hybrid lens holds - accumulative opening shifts to causal middle, maintaining coherence. The orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, midnight shift) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "hush" as a mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Seraphine's debt is repaid through the apple's transformation, creating seeds that "sow new chances" while she dissolves. The cost is legible: "heart hollowed yet resonant" and Seraphine's permanent departure after brief corporeal return. Slight deduction for the convenience of the carved bead's precise placement enabling resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Wren's weaving creates a literal "thoroughfare spiraling outward" that transforms the labyrinth from exclusive space to accessible path. The blood-drop represents visible cost, and the accumulative structure coheres through the weaving metaphor. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the sundial discovery and its restoration. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when placing the tent peg transforms the sundial and reframes the protagonist's interrupted journey, with visible cost in his years of exile now reweighted as necessary pause. Orientation anchors (island, dry season, burial excavation) establish cleanly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Mirielle's "vocation widened" to include drafting sentiments, with visible cost in accepting responsibility for finishing Palimpsest's work. The accumulative structure coheres through consistent imagery (margins, surfaces, obsolescence). Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "cost" - while conceptually clear, it lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Charged Poise: Selis stands at a crystallized moment where she must act within a two-hour window, with legible stakes (archivists' lives, knowledge preservation) and felt cost (leaving safety for danger). The accumulative build through embroidery-as-conspiracy-mapping pays off when "supply trains would divert at dawn" emerges from her method. Minor orientation wobble with "telegraphs" and "royal archive" arriving late without clear spatial relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Charged Poise closure where Eline crystallizes the "moment before deciding" and commits to sending the letter, with visible cost in the "glowing seam" where pain transformed. The accumulative structure builds through water/liquid imagery toward overflow and release. The cost is felt through physical pain and the recognition of mutual paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (cast messages forming "REGROW") that reweights meaning at closure through the delivered sentence and coral fragment return. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as the narrator carries "a sentence, a fragment, and a map of echoing hearts" into ongoing conflict. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Lina's rediscovered memory transforms both self and setting, with visible cost in "trembled with both laughter and tears." The accumulative structure coheres well through layered artifacts building to revelation. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2. Minor deduction for the knowledge network's convenient capabilities stretching credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching ("wake the paint, wake the stone, wake the silence, then wake yourself") that pays off through escalating awakening sequences. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden transforms the city into living murals of curiosity, with visible cost in citizens' lost certainty. The "nested awakenings" concept structures the progression effectively, though the rapid city-wide transformation in the final beats strains plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from infiltration through delivery to escape, with clear stakes (thought taxation) established early. The closure lands with Charged Poise - they've planted defiance and plan to continue despite costs ("cultivating every unspoken word we hadn't yet been charged for"). Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost - the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from isolation through journey to transformation, with the garden scene providing a Resonant Reconfiguration where insomnia becomes generative rather than destructive. The postcard serves as an effective catalyst, and the cost is visible in Mareth's trembling hands and the "war inside her" that must cease. The elder-self meeting pushes credibility but doesn't break the accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory layering (mist, glass orchids, sound) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library transforms from archive to living garden. The closure lands with visible cost—"countless names still slept in dust"—and Orielle's commitment to ongoing work, satisfying the lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from Ada's commission through discovery to diplomatic resolution, with clear closure showing treaties inked and silence transformed to "rest, not rupture." The cost is visible in the risk Ada takes with the potentially lethal archive and the delegates' forced honesty. Slight weakness in the mechanical convenience of how perfectly the ribbon method works.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating volcanic pressure that culminates in Mara's successful harmonization—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "conflicting values had not vanished; they had only been tuned into rough consonance." The cost is visible in her physical trembling and the acknowledged temporary nature of the solution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure—Marietta releases the bird carrying both meteorite and trust, accepting vulnerability. The cost is legible in "letting old names curl into smoke" and the risk of "repeating old tragedies." Who/where/when anchored early (bookshop attic, Marietta, late spring), and the pattern of dust-to-music-to-flight builds coherently to the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery accumulates (prisms, mazes, thresholds) toward Mira's acceptance of "necessary distances" as choreography rather than abandonment. The closure lands through Charged Poise—she chooses to maintain distance until the sacred no longer needs sacredness, with clear emotional cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish adequately by ~120 words despite the impressionistic opening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Mara and Lio achieve belonging "to both sky and sea." The burnt feather's placement creates the keystone moment that unlocks the city's memory, with visible cost in leaving the feather behind. Orientation anchors (underwater facility, Dr. Calyx, bathysphere descent) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from tideline collection through cave journey to path restoration. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira reunites emotions with vanished paths, making them whole again. The cost is subtly present in "respecting loss" and the consumed paths' burden, though it could be more viscerally felt. Who/where/when anchored early and lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well, with each volunteer's experience building toward the concept of "orchestrated serendipity." The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the bishop floats away "uncharted but not unplanned," crystallizing the theme with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4 ("tidal arcade under stars").

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Sable transforms from exile to "origin," having successfully inscribed her cosmic verse on the world with felt cost (exhaustion, risk of discovery). The moonstone dissolution serves as the pivotal intensification that enables the final transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "poem circulating in every vein of earth," though the cost and reconfiguration remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from harbor to atrium to transformed perception. Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the atrium's transformation making beauty "adjust the axis of perception" with visible cost in Mira's labor and the town's shifted awareness. The pond's closing rings provide satisfying closure confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the ritual scene, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters accept transformed roles as grief's stewards. Cost is visible in the porcelain shard exchange and their "duet of hard softness." However, the "bargained innocence" concept remains abstract, and the celestial framing feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based imagery (balloons, spirals, equations) building toward a Conceptual Repricing where hope becomes mathematically transmissible. However, the cost remains entirely abstract—"communities discovering the parchment" happens in Ora's imagination without verified on-page consequence. The closure lacks the required visible, felt, or conceptual cost; we see deployment but not price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora's vow to guard the corridors crystallizes her stance with felt cost ("inheritance humming around her"). The pattern of acoustic discovery builds through concrete beats: finding diaries → discovering negative → locating capsule → activating recorder, each deepening the stakes. Cost is visible in her choice to forgo comfort "beside the new polar lakes" for guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mural transforms reality—children play with "unseen doorways now shimmering in alley walls" and the heartbeat returns "bearing souvenirs of luminous chances." The accumulative lens holds consistently through musical pigments, coded lullabies, and layered imagery. Cost is visible in the borrowed heartbeat's return and the transformation of the city. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 6 to establish the painter relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and unexpected orphan provinces clause. The cost is visible—both leaders' resistance then capitulation, the "fraction of hatred" released. The accumulative pattern of ritual→negotiation→unexpected addition creates meaningful pressure that forecloses pure military solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Serafina releases both bird and drought control, accepting reputational cost. The manufactured drought revelation midway recontextualizes her journey effectively. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how the echo actually enables the bird's revival, though the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from rumor to seeking to transformation, with Mirelle's untangling actions creating irreversible change for the entire city. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as the sanctuary transforms from hidden to manifest, forcing honesty through beauty with clear cost to the old order. The drive lens (Causal with Accumulative elements) holds consistently through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when scholars hear their certainties reversed and request teaching, with Silas departing "uncommonly serene." The accumulative structure coheres through repeated performance-revelation cycles. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral—the scholars are "chastened" but we don't see what they sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Pearl's knot ritual allows the grotto to remember the midwife's story, mending the monarchs' interrupted cadence. The cost appears as the purposely temporary nature of her structures—memory "rooted long enough" but not permanently. The accumulative texture builds through ritual actions toward this crystallized moment where overlooked history gains voice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the bronze bell preserves not just the punched card's melody but the vows locked in the ceremonial rope, creating "spring hummed forever" inside the cores. Cost is legible in Elien leaving "with empty hands" and the physical exhaustion that "trembled through him." The accumulative structure coheres as each ritual step—loosening knots, breathing warmth, pouring bronze—builds toward this preservation of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - FHO accepts their role knowing the seal will shatter, choosing to become a link in an eternal chain. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through time-layered visions and the dance sequence. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The "Directive dies unless danced" riddle effectively triggers the decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully, with the magic square's transformation and the astrolabe's sacrifice creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where "mystery could expand without losing equilibrium." The cost is visceral - losing his most precious instrument - and the covenant's acceptance reweights all prior material. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around the "covenant with the unknown."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Tyra's release creates ripple effects ("Reality would keep folding...but somewhere within its rough drafts a quieter draft now existed"). Cost is legible in the "grey wisps" of released resentment and the sanctuary's dissolution. The cellular memory mechanism provides persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the dream transforms from "runaway" to "fellow traveler" with visible cost (accepting fractures as essential). The breathing pattern builds coherently toward boundary dissolution. Slight opacity around the dream's initial nature prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the image of "petals fall like blessings" reweighting the earlier "deciduous vows" that shed like guilt. Cost is visible in Seraphin's exile and the orchard's threatened destruction. The accumulative lens holds consistently, though the resolution's "quiet graft already binding wood, stone, and will" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Silence, at last, had inherited him" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (becoming footnotes in someone else's story). The pattern of temporal paradox is taught early and pays off through the apprentice vision. Slight deduction for abstract moments mid-story that momentarily blur the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the bookstore's mutations and linguistic resonances building toward the vault opening. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as both characters step into their transformed roles. The "memory of germination" payment shows clear conceptual cost. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed final paragraph that introduces new seekers without fully crystallizing the protagonists' costs.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the brothers escape together through shared storytelling, with visible cost in the "sadness lingered like distant calliope notes." The accumulative lens holds as imagery patterns (emerald light, narrative threads, trapped freedom) build toward the escape. Orientation anchors arrive within limits though "chimera twin discoverer" creates initial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the wax seal merges with rope to restore missing pages, creating visible change in the university's reality. The piece teaches its pattern early (forbidden door at thirteenth hour) and pays it off when the door melts back "right on schedule." Cost is legible in the transformation of silence into citations and the permanent alteration of the seal. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the mechanism room setting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered silence-seeking methods, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where "silence met silence" creates the bloom of hush. The cost is visible: the echo stone greys and must be left behind, while the mapkeeper continues deeper "ready to conjure more stillness." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the rekindled beacon creates "that barely measurable tilt of destiny" with clear cost (the prism cracking further, splitting into hovering slivers). The accumulative structure builds through 73 evenings of star-tracking to the vision sequence and final illumination. The orientation anchors (Lioh, ruined coast, beacon tower) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered memories toward Lira's decision to omit herself—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("The omission stung"). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early with "Mist drifted like unspoken questions" and pays it off when "darkness archive[s] her footsteps." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the exact nature of her archival task.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the final uprising, where "gravity had always been an opinion; tonight, it was officially outvoted" serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The progression from solitary infiltration to collective rebellion tracks clearly. Who/where/when anchors establish by line 2. The cost of defying authority is implied through the uprising but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Marella's decision to approach the council "like a gentle tide, not a storm surge," showing clear cost in restraining her righteous anger. The accumulative structure coheres well through tidal/temporal metaphors building to this crystallized stance. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation—the emotional price of restraint could be more viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Father's acceptance of the upward-building philosophy shows clear before/after with emotional cost ("tune tasted faintly of apology"). The gravity inversion pattern establishes early and pays off through Father's rescue. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Small deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Father's arrival precisely during the inversion hour.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora's internal arrival ("the journey has arrived inside me") transforms her relationship to silence, with visible cost in her final unmoving line. The accumulative pattern of monitoring/calibrating/transferring builds coherently through density increases toward this crystallized moment where silence becomes "the last conductor."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Kestrel transforms the throne from singular sovereignty to collective possibility, with visible cost in her renunciation of power. The ruby flake's division into "thousand glittering seeds" creating communal access lands with clear thematic weight. Minor orientation wobble with "Montpellier Nine" as desert megacity needs earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Declin learns to breathe and passes through the doorknocker portal, while Mara accepts her ongoing role. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated breath/suffocation imagery building to transformation. Cost is visible in "loaded emptiness settle, not heavier, only more articulate." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where diamond-sprouting mushrooms embody the "pressure into diamonds" transformation with clear economic cost ("economy rewritten from soil"). The hybrid lens holds as textural accumulation dominates the opening/closing while the corridor provides causal pressure. Slight opacity in the quantum promise mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis—Iria's refusal to deliver the evidence forecloses revolution with visible cost ("ash rarely thanked its sweeper"). The causal chain from searching to discovery to moral choice holds cleanly, with the gramophone mechanism providing concrete stakes that pay off in her final decision to preserve rather than destroy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Caron naming the place "Possibility" and transforming from knight to poet, with visible cost ("letting wars, titles, and loneliness unsnap"). The accumulative lens holds as theatrical/puppeteering imagery builds toward this crystallization, though the "missing page" device feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Jordan pockets the button and considers restoration over military service, while Mara feels "the first suture tighten across her own heart." The accumulative lens holds as dust patterns guide discovery, leading to the final image of "two shadows lengthened, tactfully hopeful against the examined unknown." Cost is visible in both characters' transformations, though the emotional price could be more viscerally rendered in Jordan's final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from Lina's discovery of the puddle-map through her journey to the lagoon where she absorbs the erased histories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration as she becomes the living repository of suppressed voices. The cost is legible: "Memory fused with flesh" shows her permanent transformation, and "unstoppable silhouette" implies she's now a marked target.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sound imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy dissolves into "negative space." The closure lands with conceptual cost—catastrophe prevented through artistic erasure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4, and the lens holds consistently through musical accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Briony transforms from seed-sorter to guardian, with the arbor's physical transformation (ashen to emerald) and sprouting candleflowers marking visible cost and change. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-teaching (monuments, falling leaves, silver messages) though the vision sequence risks abstraction before recovering with concrete transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from compass discovery through vault revelation to Milo's choice to "smash the compass against the table." Closure achieves Decisive Change when Milo destroys the device, with cost visible in letting "the rehearsal proceed unobserved" and accepting unpredictability. The transformation from collecting broken time to freeing it lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the kintsugi restoration of both Jory and Aurora, with visible cost in her tears as "coins of salt." The accumulative lens holds as density increases from rain to forge to final aurora. Slight weakness in the fantastical resurrection mechanism not being fully taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the gorge transforms from "a place of endings" to one "humming with beginnings" with visible cost (Eluan's tears, the empty vial). The harp's transformation from warped to tuned crystallizes the change. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory intensification and mathematical revelation build toward a Conceptual Repricing—mercy reframed as reciprocal transformation rather than constant. The closure lands with the protagonist becoming "both variable and witness," though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors clearly (post-torture forest escape) and causality holds as enhanced perception enables the mathematical breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered translations (light→painting→dissolution). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fragment dissolves into "pure direction" and a child feels the lighthouse has "moved home," with cost visible in Irida's bent knees under "the weight of future errands." The persistent constraint of translating the untranslatable shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through ghostly appearances, dust patterns, and the mainspring discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlen removes the timepiece, releasing both ghosts and building from their "weightless burden." The cost is legible in "Behind him, the ticket office stood silent, mainspring gone, ghosts at rest" - the supernatural companionship he valued is now lost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Ellis's action creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where "Now is always" literally reshapes reality, with visible cost in the library's transformation and "recursive footnotes" collapse. The orientation anchors (glass orchard library, clouds, Ellis as operator) establish cleanly by line 3, and the piece teaches its surreal logic early through "Reality had become negotiable."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through bronze smoke time, velvet-draped mirrors, and crystallized script to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Velen accepts the "lustered ache" while constructing futures. The closure lands with conceptual cost—acknowledging permanent sorrow while choosing to build. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the chronostorm experiment provides the decisive deepening that unlocks meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Decisive Change: Clay becomes permanently bound to truth to restore daylight. The causal chain from crow's message to final covenant acceptance tracks cleanly. Cost is explicit but the mystical mechanics ("chip moderated the torrent") occasionally strain credibility within the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist steps through the question-mark doorway, understanding "why the explorers never returned." The accumulative structure coheres as collected scents return to origin and memories "flock upward like liberated birds of rain." Cost is legible in the abandonment of return ("with a last look at the silent skiff"), though the conceptual nature of the transformation ("questions can live here forever") slightly abstracts the price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered imagery (ships overlapping across time, the gate as "opened book") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gate allows villagers to "feel time loosen, then retie itself kindly." The cost is visible in Iona's labor ("Days bled into nights") and the transformation of her original commission into this temporal threshold. Slight weakness in the middle section where the alliance mechanics feel more explained than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Maris's mural awakens at midnight, answering the grandfather's question through action rather than explanation—"flowers bloom at night not for secrecy but for communion." The accumulative structure builds through postcards→cathedral→revelation→creation with clear cost: "Tears welled, not of sorrow but of continuation." The orientation is immediate and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the lagoon transforms from "starless" to "storied," with clear cost in Mara's tears and the permanent alteration of her relationship to memory. The accumulative structure coheres well through retrocognitive episodes building toward the parley. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical transition "After the letters are found" which disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas's absorption into the bottle completes the town's revival with clear cost—his individual existence traded for collective rebirth. The accumulative lens holds as fragments build pressure toward the bottle's splitting and final transformation. "To perfect the reborn organism, the architect must join the architecture" crystallizes the thematic and causal threads. Minor orientation wobble around "Paper-Lantern Cove" as both place and metaphor slightly dulls early clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the foghorn's silence accumulating through prophetic grooves, liquid memory, and the apple's instruction to create a Resonant Reconfiguration where planting releases archived joy. Cost is visible when Loranth must choose between shelving emotion (his sworn duty) versus releasing it. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern of archived sound/emotion teaches itself early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alma trades her youth to restore seasonal time, with visible cost ("silver threading her hair"). The accumulative structure coheres as each fantastical element (dragon-hen, vortex, mirrors) builds toward the entropy-reversal payoff. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of "decreasing entropy" prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara chooses the "balanced chord instead of a shriek," validating her philosophy with visible cost—the risk to valley towns if wrong. The accumulative structure builds through technical details and sensory observations toward this crystallized moment. The ceremonial bell tug transforms from "older alarms" to "thanksgiving," completing the arc with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from routine cleaning to cosmic choreography, with the lantern glass repair serving as Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms both Janus and his understanding of his work. Cost is visible in "his own fissures knit in sympathetic resonance" and the permanent change to how he performs his duties. The closure lands cleanly with "the universe...answered with a hush of primal elegance" reweighting all prior sweeping.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught silence and resonance building to Orin accepting the covenant as keeper, where "color seeped back into the dunes" shows visible transformation. The closure lands with clear cost—Orin binds himself to eternal stewardship, "allowing vows to resonate through him." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when time transforms from measurement to "braided cloth" to shared sensation ("17 as cinnamon or 9 as footsteps on snow"), with Basil's borrowed time expiring as the visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through three movements: solo measurement, collaborative discovery, communal transformation. The orientation anchors (emerald silo, Basil as timekeeper, post-numeric upheaval world) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the repaired kite's flight validates the premise with visible transformation - the drake's feather becomes spine, patches become stained glass. The accumulative lens holds as imagery patterns (woven dawns, harmonizing discord) build toward the final image. Cost is present in both the boy's earlier frustration and Edda's patient labor. Slight deduction for predictable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through copper-wiring sequences toward Mara's final integration into the island's "endless breathing"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (her death enabling the network). The piece teaches its pattern early through systematic botanical documentation and pays off with the communal listening scene.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from meteorite message through path-following to portal transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("footprints of light no rain could erase" implies dissolution of physical form). Slight opacity in the "artificial pilgrimage" mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where battlefield becomes garden and the coachman's empty carriage fills with metaphorical passengers ("every seat held only breeze"). The accumulative structure coheres as bird-language enables fertilization, leading to visible transformation: "green spears already pricked through the mud." Cost is legible in the reef's death breaking the millennial accord and the soil "drunk on salt and sorrow." The lens holds consistently though orientation anchors arrive gradually.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from silence to whispered coordinates to the dawn's "faint glow." The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing when Orin realizes "tinted revelations were not colors of sight but shades of nearness waiting to be named," reweighting the entire journey with visible cost (leaving the settlement). The orientation anchors (Orin, scrapyard, post-war) establish clearly by line 7.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered images (compass gold/silver, starlight piercing darkness, paper ship). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the protagonist crystallizes her stance as explorer rather than exile with visible cost (father's temporal distance, station isolation). The orientation anchors establish clearly: station corridor, post-shutdown, anniversary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where replacing certainty with playful possibility transforms the world's future. The cost is legible in "certainty ossified" being broken and the sky shifting from "wrong" to "deliciously unknown." Minor issue: the Curator's immediate cooperation feels slightly undermotivated despite the sundial's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through walking-as-script and chess moves as negotiation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Ezra transforms from solitary keeper to shared steward, with visible cost in relinquishing sole control. The "interregnum" timeframe creates genuine urgency. Slight deduction for abstract conceptual language that occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where home becomes portable direction rather than fixed place, with felt cost in accepting perpetual journey. The bookstore's nightly reorganization creates persistent constraint that shapes tactics (rushing to plant talents before shuffle). Orientation anchored early (mountain-bookstore, valley, wanderer seeking). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how planting talents stabilizes the architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating symbolic work through tapestry, labyrinth, and final forgiveness achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible in "embraced the single path he actually walked" and the prince's ghost's approval. Strong causality from guilt through puzzle-solving to village revival, though the mechanism linking Rhaun's forgiveness to the village's awakening could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where both characters transform through collaborative art-making, visible in the Marshal tearing his warrant and Vera feeling "lighter, not absolved but accompanied." The cost is legible—Vera cannot have traditional forgiveness without losing memory, so creates an alternative through gifting the Marshal's virtue. Orientation anchored effectively by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Brielle transforms from mending external history to mending herself, with gold veins as visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each narrated story builds pressure toward self-integration. Orientation anchors (workshop, alchemist, statue) establish quickly. The closure lands powerfully with "air tasted of storms forgiven."

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the mirror-painting ritual that transforms broken glass into waves, fulfilling the promise with felt cost (isolation, years of waiting). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through cave journey to climactic pool scene. Slight softness in cost articulation at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens governs effectively as sensory details (jasmine, cork vibrations, bell note) build toward proving the whisper's superiority. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the bell confirms the theory, with conceptual cost implied through "unshouting faith." The experimental setup creates genuine tension despite the quiet stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marrow becoming "a stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light," with clear cost in her permanent transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as midnight calls teach her to build the apparatus that enables reverse migration. However, the conceptual mechanism of "reverse migration" remains somewhat abstract despite vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward Ilya's shift from solitude to community collaboration. The closure lands with visible cost (confession about abandoning his sister) and reconfigures his approach from seeking individual cure to spreading collective healing. Causality occasionally softens but the pattern accumulation drives the ending effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught memory borrowing that pays off when Oswald discovers and accepts the ampoule. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Oswald accepts both "burden and privilege" of guardianship, with cost visible in his recognition of shared isolation. The fantastical premise of borrowed memories is established early and remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (maps→scrap→chip→ants→cavern→door) building to Decisive Change when Elias finds his sister. The cost is explicit: the doorway seals permanently behind them with the creek flooding outside, foreclosing return. The "empirically intuitive act of following ants home" crystallizes the thematic merger of evidence and instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal linkage from dreams to journey to revelation to abdication, with the orb's bleeding starlight serving as both literal discovery and metaphorical truth. The closure lands with visible cost ("unseat her," "toppled palaces"), though the sister revelation feels slightly convenient despite its thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - Cressida's renunciation of mastery reweights "returning differently" from failure to wisdom. The cost is legible when she scatters the unresolved colors, choosing uncertainty over control. The orientation anchors (alchemist, ember nexus, twilight) establish clearly by line 3, and the shell's properties constrain choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the narrator rewrites prophecy through charcoal draft, achieving "adequately footnoted" stasis with clear cost (accepting temporal paradox). The birch bark scroll's transformation from prophecy to "estranged sibling" alongside the new draft creates genuine closure, though the orientation takes slightly long to anchor the ranger role.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as sensory details and craft metaphors build toward Amira's realization that "absence could funnel perception, not drain it," a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the sacrificed clock, her ongoing grief). The closure lands with Amira drawing a new map "not of fragrances but of the morning's emotional terrain," showing adaptation with visible price. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation and some causality softness in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Seren transforms her relationship with fear through ritual action, with visible cost in the blood-ink mixture and the choice to bear scars as "lanterns, evidence of nights survived." The accumulative structure coheres through tea ceremony beats building to this transformation, though the "thunder bird" backstory element feels slightly disconnected from the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through lilac-electricity-music layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol's "imperfect miracle" transforms from ghost-exorcism to self-absolution, with the orchard's stay of execution marking temporal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when Trond discovers clocks measure "circulation of connection" rather than sequential time, with visible cost in the "gratitude and grief" he feels understanding centuries of sabotage. The accumulative structure coheres as water imagery, hesitation, and mechanical precision build toward this reweighting of time itself. Minor orientation delay (protagonist's name appears line 3) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through spore imagery and permeable barriers building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara transforms from detector to welcomer. The cost is legible in "some doors secure the world by opening" - she sacrifices her protective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Celeste gathers city scrawls that culminate in the lantern discovery and glass-breaking moment—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "uncertainty...sat beside her like a quiet friend." Cost is visible in the shards she gathers and the question she'll carry to the hospital. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library location unclear until line 26) and some causality softness around how the lantern appears.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the self-call that reweights the operator's entire practice—"endings everywhere are clearing their throats, rehearsing introductions." The cost is felt through the childhood memory and the transformation of the operator's understanding. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "who" more concretely in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator accepts permanent custodianship ("I understood that meant always"). The cost is visible - carrying the weight of collective memory and responsibility for renewal. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from documentation to participation to guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the communal rhythm scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes visible music—"colors spilled across the night like choir robes." The cost is legible: musicians' grief transformed but Harlan lost. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of dawn's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as artistic clues build toward the archive revelation and ember return, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when "The archive had never blamed her; it had only waited."

The orientation anchors (Marlin, Pier Seven, night shift) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where creating light patterns with shutters transforms unspoken grief into visible constellations, with clear emotional cost in the released secret. The accumulative structure builds through water/light imagery toward the final "darkness kept its stars." Orientation anchors (canal, night, protagonist waiting) establish by line 4. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "voice" the protagonist hears despite the guardian never speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where synchronized displays create "saplings sprouting"—a visible transformation with implied social cost of challenging the town's "brittle" certainty. The accumulative structure coheres through chess/contemplation motifs building to the final image of pieces "forever one quiet move from transformation." Cost is felt through the town's pause and mayor's schedule "slipping like sand."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's call catalyzing a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eren surrenders control to find freedom. Cost is visible in abandoning his landlocked life and accepting impermanence ("the island breathed once more, turned translucent").

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through Marrow's narrated mundane tasks toward Earned Stasis—Ithica accepts grief alongside memory in the "remade hush." The cedar lamp's "pale gold shimmer" provides visible transformation with cost acknowledged ("Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float"), though the inspector arrival feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through breath-stanzas, walking meditation, and the colonnade's emergence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hum transforms collective certainty. The cost is legible in "shoulders loosening as if heavy cloaks were unfastened" and the permanent alteration of the city's sonic landscape. Orientation anchors (poet, frozen lake, post-ban winter) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Goran bows and acknowledges that "his perfect orbs and flawless goblets had never danced with such living light."

The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Jonas's shift from isolated data archeologist to someone who understands "Mystery inherited is responsibility shared." The measuring tape's transformation from length-tool to timeline creates the decisive reweighting. Cost appears in the coinless wallet containing only recorded thanks - a tangible price for intangible wisdom. Some orientation delay (Jonas's role emerges gradually) but serves the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Kesari transforms from exiled cataloguer to knowledge-bearer who will "teach the world how to listen again," with the cost embodied in carrying "the terrible wisdom" that threatens erasure. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering (perfumes, twilight, sparks) that builds to the transformation, though orientation could anchor slightly earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting "unanswered frames to unfold in silence" reweights the entire quest from recovery to allowing metamorphosis. The cost is visible in the narrator's permanent separation from the ground world and acceptance of incomplete transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with ritualistic shedding that builds to Earned Stasis—Calder accepts his fraudulent past and commits to truth-telling despite uncertain reception. The closure lands with visible cost (exile, destroyed materials, uncertain future). The con's revelation provides clear causality, though the workshop scene could anchor its temporal relation to the banishment more precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Decisive Change closure: Odelia transfers the miracle to the dying child, healing both. The hourglass timer creates urgency, coffee ring mapping provides method, and plant guidance drives the surgical extraction—all elements cohere causally. Cost is visible in her blood and pain, though the instant self-healing slightly softens the price. The piece teaches its metaphorical logic early ("scars were paragraphs") and pays it off through literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure building from physical exploration to metaphysical discovery, with the projection scene creating resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with conceptual cost - unused love must circulate rather than be stored. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. Deduction for abstract conceptual work that occasionally loses concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with clear cost - Ilya empties himself to free creativity, becoming "a bell rung clear of clapper yet still resonant."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Charged Poise closure lands effectively as Jonas stands "on a cliff overlooking vistas made entirely of unanswered sentences," crystallizing his journey from passive translocation to active choice with visible cost ("felt its absence ticking inside his pulse"). The accumulative structure coheres well through sound-as-navigation and gear-as-key motifs. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the "vistas of unanswered sentences" which, while resonant, edges toward conceptual convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lis retrieves her courage from the ridge's clearing of abandoned leashes, with the lantern's ignition marking the decisive moment. The accumulative structure builds through ferry crossing, ridge ascent, and return, each phase deepening the metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density through discovery-transmission-witness-reply sequence, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where "the world shifts" carries clear cost (Ila's endangered position, irreversible breach). The closure lands with both characters accepting new vulnerability. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Situational lens holds as external pressure (council threat) forces stance crystallization through the rose demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from dormant phone to activated presses, with clear closure showing Amelia's decision to print the floodgate truth as a Decisive Change with visible cost (selling estate for reparations). The orrery scene effectively reweights the inheritance metaphor, though the "proof by contradiction" logic feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through the amber ritual that transforms Lin from haunted to cleansed. The cost is visible: "Without the ghost, his mind was a cathedral after bells" showing both loss and gain.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the mandala reveals everyday domesticity rather than cosmic secrets, reweighting the premise with clear conceptual cost. However, the closure's impact is diminished by explicit thematic statement ("Meaning...is not hidden in grand riddles") rather than allowing the image alone to carry the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory details (ash, tesserae, wind) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where renaming transforms the city's destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) - the corporate intrusion forces tactical withdrawal with clear cost (abandoning breakthrough discovery). Causal chain holds: experiment → success → intrusion → protective disconnection. The "willowglass hope" that "bent but never broke" reweights at closure with "possibility still flickered," showing resilience under threat. Deduction for slightly soft cost articulation - the price of disconnection could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Ruen becomes the bridge between sleeping humanity and the cave's voice, with clear cost (isolation, transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the final image of braided strands represents mutual liberation with visible cost. The palimpsest motif builds through layered names, overwritten lives, and thinning ink to earn the ending's transformation. Minor orientation lag (who/where anchors arrive late) costs some clarity but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered timeline visions and the recurring "phototropic to kindness" motif that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain: evidence disappears → Samara discovers oily film → traces reveal conspiracy pattern → confrontation exposes decade-old arson truth. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as dormant empathy awakens in all three characters.

The "bruise" metaphor and seed-swallowing create coherent pressure that builds to the trade's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from failed appraiser seeking redemption to discovering Mara's lost recordings, with the closure landing as Gideon's decision to "relay what they carried: proof that failure is not finale."

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation through analogical thinking leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost as Aram accepts his sister's "absence transform into an echo he could carry."

Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Ikram's decision to lead the colony "where echoes begin, not where they end," with cost visible in the stakes of potential annihilation and the dimming starlight. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and cosmic imagery build toward the final crystallization, though the prophecy's backwards causality concept doesn't fully integrate with the coin-casting mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator accepts their commission to name fears, with felt cost ("echo of sacrifice remained...inside our bones"). The accumulative structure coheres through naming sequences that build to transformation. Deduction for slightly abstract cost that could be more visceral at the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with water drops as metronome building toward the bell's transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Orin learns "rebuilding sometimes means teaching things how to break more gently"—a conceptual repricing with felt cost (his exhaustion, offered sweat). The causality holds: broken bell → water ritual → gravity reversal → self-sacrifice → gentle breaking wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's act of preservation reweights the opening's "mirrored hush" into active remembrance. The accumulative structure builds coherently through photograph discoveries to her decision to "expunge the engineer's version of history." Cost is visible in her "small, precisely humane" disobedience that risks her position. The circular structure with the wind chime creates satisfying pattern completion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Sera's integration of the crystal as "a soft pulse beneath her collarbone," with clear cost in her deferred transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well: silence transforms through layered sound/memory into restored laughter, with clear cost in confronting the drowned child's incomplete lullaby. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "silence returns, but it is no longer overdressed; it wears a grin," though the conceptual cost could be more visceral. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting uncertainty transforms the narrator into "an annex open to weather and wonder," with clear cost in carrying "the frozen garden in mist inside my breathing." The accumulative structure builds through image density (pendant discovery → mist-shape encounter → transformation) though the middle section with the cultists feels slightly disconnected from the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ritual structure provides clear accumulative escalation through "successive approximation," with each ingredient and confession building toward the crozier's restoration and Everard's transformation. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (peeling away the "mask of hopelessness," speaking humiliations aloud), and the final image of carrying the restored staff "ready to vivify worlds" reweights his initial despair.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the fragment's transformation revives the dead city and river, with Mara pocketing "only warm glass" as visible cost. Causality holds as the lunar perigee enables the signal, which leads to finding the fragment, which enables the revival. The "new questions assembling" beneath the silence crystallizes Mara's ongoing role.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Milo turns the hourglass and passengers solidify into chosen versions of themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sinew threads tightening, doorways blossoming, and the final loosened threads "humming with low, forgiving light." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara cuts her keystone memory, paying visible cost (losing her memory of learning to speak) to preserve the collective transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 ("city's abandoned planetarium shortly before dusk").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the discovery that aliens are "lighthouses" teaching "forgotten geometry" transforms the entire premise—navigation becomes "listening for the sky under water." The cost is legible in Tarek's tears and the foreclosed surface world. The accumulative structure coheres as each teaching moment builds toward the trench revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - the discovery transforms the "reeling hush" into "vigilant hush" with clear cost (draining her lantern's power).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain culminates in a Decisive Change where Mara recovers her memories and commits to future reciprocation, with visible cost in the "tears joined the salt" and the exchange demanded. The orientation anchors cleanly (Atlantic shallows, dawn, Mara rowing), and the because/therefore linkage holds throughout, though the "decades later" promise at the end slightly weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirrors' testimony reverses exile, with visible cost in the severed warrant and narrator's choice to remain. The accumulative pattern of geometry, reflection, and reversal coheres at the ending. Slight dock for cost being more conceptual than visceral in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the luminous tree that spreads wonder downstream, with visible cost in the exhaustion and lifelong commitment required. The accumulative structure builds through ritual steps toward the final image of "newborn spectrums promised to weave between worlds forever," though the village transformation feels somewhat unearned given the limited dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accumulated silence transforms from "choking dust" to "sand building an island." The accumulative structure coheres well, with each ritual action deepening the stakes. Cost is legible in the transformation of both silence types and the spirits' resolution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Levin's discoveries layer—torn map, silent footage comparison, hidden corridor, bronze cylinder—building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where he understands mapping as "attentive practice that asks before it names." The cost appears in his decision to leave the grate replaced, forgoing further exploration. Minor orientation wobble with the sudden outdoor emergence weakens early grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (wire knots, floating pages, snow globe) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where understanding arrives through modeling failure rather than solving it. The mathematician's journal provides the crucial turn ("only surrender could solve for peace") that reweights the narrator's approach. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (submersible, sunken ship library).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, with density increasing through color-coding system (violet=sorrow, gold=yearning, teal=hope) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the encoded wall becomes "a memory palace for every orphaned feeling." Cost is visible in the ephemeral nature—only accessible "between lightning and thunder." The closure lands with the balladeer's acceptance of hidden impact over recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the diary discovery providing the crucial intensification that enables the final connection. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "travelers aloft in wounded air" with clear emotional cost in both characters' cautious vulnerability. The encrypted diary functions as perfect causal pressure that transforms the servant's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern accretion (emotional cloud taxonomy, spooled wholeness, memory compression) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eira's fall becomes proof of her hypothesis. The closure lands with clear cost—her physical sacrifice validates that "empty spaces remember who trusted them." Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual framework that occasionally drifts from concrete scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from personal limitation through coin discovery to transformed observatory, with each beat deepening Liora's relationship to unseeable perception. The closure—city rescinding demolition after crews witness the mural's effect—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (blindfolded risk) and conceptual shift (limitation becoming architecture). Slight deduction for the warden's somewhat convenient appearance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from curiosity through pattern recognition to validated discovery. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the hopscotch board transforms from children's game to navigational key, with clear cost (risking the ship's course on untested theory). Who/where/when anchored immediately, lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (mirrors yielding secrets, prophecy fragments forming a mechanical rose) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Selene transforms from locksmith-repairer to one who invites stilled things to breathe. The crystal heart's integration into the clock mechanism creates visible cost through the tears that thaw frost from her cheeks. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the story builds through layered repair efforts toward a resonant reconfiguration where mist fuses the fractures. The closure lands with visible cost (exhaustion, risk of planetary dissolution) and the "bruised yet blooming" final image reweights the fragility. Some causality wobbles around how chalk messages physically vibrate under boots, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's sacrifice recalibrates time itself, creating "one more cradle song around the sun" with visible cost (her heartbeat offered). The nested patterns of gears/echoes/time build density toward the decisive act. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, Mara, her role) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from nut discovery through dream blueprint to labyrinth reconfiguration, with clear cost in risk and effort. The closure lands as Decisive Change - the labyrinth transforms from trap to guide, saving the miners. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by line 4, and the frost deadline creates genuine urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - Talitha's polymer swans and message to Mara create connection from separation. The river foam insight provides causal linkage to her solution, and the cost (dolphin deaths, lost relationship) remains visible throughout. The ending's "shared resonance" lands with earned weight, though the dream sequence slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Kes chooses absence over inscription, allowing "possibility [to flood] the slate like dawn." The accumulative structure coheres through glass/text imagery building to this crystallized understanding that stories begin in emptiness, with clear cost (spent moonlight, expired parole).

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kilor's self-imprisonment creates Charged Poise where cost is felt through "taste of iron remains."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the valley discovers "bridges where grain once divided" through accumulated linguistic and musical healing. The cost is visible: the clock tower sacrifices its weight, adapting "new syncopation" for unity. Causality holds as Lysandra's recognition of the elevator's "counterpoint" pattern leads to systematic rehabilitation through multilingual song.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (spider-web cracks, fiber-optic nerves, entangled memories) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Rhea accepts custodianship rather than possession. The cost is legible: she must abandon her original goal of archaeological ownership to become a guardian of "the fragile gate," with the mirror continuing to record as proof that "dreams, once found, refuse to remain silent."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal drive lens with motivated progression from the ticking clock through gravity inversion to vault access. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Quillon obtains the forbidden knowledge and commits to guarding it, with the cost implied through "locked in memory forever" and the weight of responsibility. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines. Minor deduction for the convenience of the gravity restoration timing perfectly with his escape.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lark's performance transforms the grove from "ordinary silence" to "listening, living hush." The cost is subtly present in the energy transfer and the "afterward light" suggesting depletion.

The closure's "hopeful melancholy guiding each step" crystallizes his new stance with visible cost in his continued wandering.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic experiments layer toward the revelation that "Empathy is heard when two silences overlap without fear," creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost (tears, unresolved grief). The piece teaches its pattern early through the silence cataloging and pays it off when Lysander realizes his project was never about absence but presence. The closure lands with visible cost as he chooses solitary documentation over joining the celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through scent layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the seed had already sprouted inside everyone willing to breathe alongside motion."

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from gravity inversion through discovery to resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (gravity crushing the sanctum) and transformation (spear spreading resilience). The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains its textural lens throughout, though the rapid resolution after finding the chamber slightly rushes the earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from investigation to diagnosis to intervention, with the closure showing Decisive Change - Mara successfully prevents future convergences. Cost is visible in the risk she takes and the "silence she had saved." The flight engineer patches as calibration markers provides good causality. Slight opacity around what exactly harvested the momentum prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the hush transforms from "prison" to "threshold, poised forever between stillness and song." The accumulative structure builds through three bell strikes that progressively dissolve barriers, with visible cost in the risk to fracturing the amber sheet's memory and the weight of generational responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through "avalanchingly quiet," driftwood markers, and the flute's resonance until the corridor scene delivers a Decisive Change where Kalen prevents his future self from stealing. The cost is legible in "grit cascaded from the saddle" and the transformation from driftwood to obsidian markers. Slight deduction for the mechanism of changing timelines feeling under-explained given the story's otherwise grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where printing the equation literally restores the vanished stars, with clear cost in Dreya keeping "one feather from each" borrowed personality.

Deduction for slight ambiguity in how the "proof" will translate to the skeptical guild.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with the puzzle-edge magic system teaching early and paying off at closure through Ira's death as "toll to distance." The Earned Stasis closure lands with visible cost. Minor orientation wobbles (the ghost hamlet visit feels temporally disconnected) and some causality stretches around the magic system prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: village transforms from rubble to luminous reconstruction through collective memory sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—traded memories create literal brightness in rebuilt structures.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lowell's shift from isolated regret to active paradox-carrier, with visible cost in leaving the sanctuary. The accumulative structure coheres through mirrored imagery (shutters/windows, hiding/revealing) building to "staying while leaving." However, the invitation's temporal paradox strains credibility without sufficient grounding, and some middle passages drift into abstract exposition about the library's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from seedball planting through tea ceremony to Elias's final vow, with Resonant Reconfiguration landing in "sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Earned Stasis - Clara's vow to never open the fob again unless "a promise elsewhere split wide" forecloses a path with felt cost. The causal chain holds throughout, though Cinder's arrival feels slightly convenient. Who/where/when anchored effectively by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the tin compass ring exchange and shared outlook "perfectly, impossibly at home," with visible cost in Zephra's evolved skepticism. The accumulative structure coheres through taste-shifts, electoral backdrop, and weather-carrier revelation, though the midpoint exposition about algorithmic weather slightly disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories transform into light and Elara's creative block releases through deliberate forgetting, with the crystal cave sealing as definitive closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as she trades her mnemonic gift for creative freedom. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how the journal pages spontaneously fill.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with seeds of lost conversations literally germinating to cleanse the toxic sky—a Resonant Reconfiguration where honesty becomes the mechanism for environmental healing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through shared stories that culminate in Mr. Cardoza's revelation and the mailbox opening. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the padlock becomes "proof that listening heals even metal too stubborn to bend," with visible emotional cost in Cardoza's transformation. Early orientation is clear (who/where/when established in opening paragraphs), though the connection between storytelling session and mailbox mystery takes time to cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance-language that pays off at the vault and in the final confrontation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira gives Vane the die, reversing their power dynamic with clear cost (the laboratory's destruction, her burning lungs). The "spider spins its web" motif effectively brackets the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from whale's beaching through coffee-ground divination to salt-crystal revelation, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when Kerrin recovers her core self and understands the memory-harvesting mechanism. The cost is visceral—years of half-life, forgotten mother and laughter—though the resolution edges toward convenience when the infant simply "merged into Kerrin's chest like smoke."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual steps toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy transforms from destructive force to healing potential ("turned inward...where meaning could heal"). The cost is legible in the meadow's brightening and the world's newfound gentleness. Minor deduction for slightly abstract mechanics of the silence-mapping process.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the narrator alone among "thyme and broken porcelain, rehearsing the syllables of sorrowful masonry," with every rooftop now "expectant." The cost is legible: inheriting both Selin's unfinished work and the burden of translation between worlds. The accumulative structure coheres as revelations about Mrs. Polina and Selin reweight all prior tea sessions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's transformation from isolating grief to carrying memory forward, with clear cost in accepting "every syllable of her brother's farewell." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the closure where "Independence...was not the absence of voices but the freedom to choose how their chorus shapes the march ahead." The brother's sacrifice provides causal backbone while the garden's mystical logic remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from entry to world-changing forgery. Closure lands with Decisive Change - the emperor's memory is literally rewritten. Cost is visible through blood sacrifice and memory toll. The "invisible key" mechanism strains slightly but pays off. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered echoes, memories, and the final pact that reweights Silva's role. The closure lands with clear cost—Silva must now carry memories "none of her own" in every performance. The countdown mechanism and descending journey provide clean causality, though the negotiation scene could be slightly more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the glacier transforms from "tomb wearing a halo" to crying/glittering simultaneity, with visible cost in the monks' discomfort and the keeper's release. The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery layering and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors clearly (wreck-diver, glacier, monks, shrine). Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns, reflections, and observations build toward the resonant reconfiguration where "The sky is changing because we are listening." Cost is conceptual but legible in the straining arms and the care not to lose droplets. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the central conflict lacking concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from investigation to discovery to protection, with clear Decisive Change when Mara becomes the orchard's guardian. Cost is visible in burning her evidence and accepting the lonelier path. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines. Slight deduction for the convenience of finding exactly the right letter fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara's "impossible note" splits the thundercloud and brings dawn, with clear cost in Orrin's years of isolation and the risk to Elara. The causal chain from receiving prophecies to training Elara to the final confrontation holds, though the mechanics of how song transforms allegiance remains somewhat abstract. The "dawn, long rehearsed" pays off the setup effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the jar-opening sequence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the music box slides into daylight. The cost is felt in "his own heart thrummed with the same lonesome splendor" - the poet remains alone while enabling others' connection. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, dawn, dune loft) establish by ~60 words. The closure lands with visible sacrifice as he releases his creation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sonic layering—tuning forks, resonance paths, sympathetic iceberg chimes—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the barricade weighs hearts and amplifies greed back as "terrible mirror of sound." Cost is visible as raiders retch and flee their "resounding shame," while Callix collapses spent. The closure lands with Mara's "belief was unnecessary when evidence rang so clear," though the final aurora signature feels slightly detached from the sonic throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the viaduct activates and "the light did not explode; it unfolded, slow as moss, unyoking me from urgency." The cost is felt through the narrator's shifted understanding and commitment to "rechart every impatient road." Orientation anchors (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, annual meeting) establish cleanly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with Decisive Change - Havel's corruption exposed, his influence "cracked like brittle glass." Causal linkage strong: investigation → discovery → evidence → exposure. Cost is visible in the systemic danger Mara confronts. The entangled memories subplot enriches but doesn't fully integrate with the corruption plot.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Maeve offers her second opinion about action versus decoration, reweighting the entire repair metaphor. The cost is felt through "uncertainty wedge beneath her ribs" and the weight shifting "from metal to intention." Some causality wobble in middle sections where metaphor occasionally overtakes scene logic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the bell's sub-audible chord ripples the acid sea and rusted buoys answer - a clear before/after with felt cost (the bell calls to things, not people). The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward this crystallized moment. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors emerge gradually) costs 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: deleted files literally "go home" as missing astronauts sing themselves back into being, with clear cost (Lyra faces punishment, servers crash, legal consequences). The accumulative pattern of recurring numbers coheres into coordinates that unlock consciousness. Minor deduction for slight orientation lag—the archive's nature clarifies gradually rather than anchoring early.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and emotional cartography build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where two become ambassadors. Closure lands with visible cost: "Tomorrow the two would depart with packs of seedlings" shows path foreclosed. Strong causality through mirror→figure→map→shards→light projection sequence. Orientation anchored early with lighthouse orchard setting, though some abstract elements ("emotional cartography") slightly muddy the physical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—Mara's decision to wait becomes a form of active patience with clear cost ("postponed departure"). The accumulative structure coheres as density increases from solitary arrival to communal singing, though the disaster backstory slightly exceeds the 20% reflection allowance without fully anchoring present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator accepts apprenticeship, with visible cost in abandoning conventional employment for empathy cultivation. The accumulative lens holds as metaphorical parallels between vineyard/language build toward the final image of "honeyed glow now inside me." Orientation anchors cleanly (bus station, dusk, pavilion).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira accepts the role of silent guardian, with cost visible in her commitment to anonymity and the weight settling "like a harmless stone." The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual gestures. Slight deduction for abstract handling of the "echo of wisdom" which could be more tangibly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solitary arrival through collective gathering to shared commitment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community transforms from isolated grief to collaborative healing through the mural plan, with cost visible in "exhaled the kind of yes that sits in the lungs like warm tea." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through lavender imagery and photograph arrangement, paying off in the final promise of guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when language shifts from "finished" dictionaries to "seedlings requesting light," with clear cost as the publishers retreat in uncertainty. The accumulative structure builds through fractured impressions toward this crystallized transformation. Orientation anchors solidly by line 4, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repeated driftwood arrangements and layered forgetting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator accepts that "the true recording was never meant for magnetic tape but for marrow," with visible cost in following echoes despite their uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Eloi teaching the clock hand "patience" by creating an equilibrium where "movement and rest were the same." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of the observatory as "a lantern above the clouds, keeping its delicate vigil." Cost is visible in the permanent suspension required ("some things must remain poised forever just before departure"). Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "restructure the feed of time itself."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory details and the transformation of mundane hospital sounds into music. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as father and son reunite through the shared musical memory, with visible emotional cost in "decades of regret began to loosen." The piece anchors who/where/when effectively in the opening lines and maintains causality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the scholars transform from rivals to collaborators through the shared sigil, with visible cost (blood, near-exile) and foreclosed path (exploitation of shadows). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (mirrors, loops, shadows) that reweight at closure. Minor orientation wobble with "after spoons bend reality" timeline marker, but who/where/when anchors land early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the heart completes the constellation, reversing the changeling substitution ("Somewhere a cradle creaked, a real baby stirring where the changeling had slept"). The accumulative lens holds as bone fragments, tooth, and heart layer into the constellation system. Cost is visible in the transformation's requirements and the characters' altered certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative structure builds from entering the grotto through polishing ritual to releasing light into the pool. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the pearl transforms the pool into floating lilies of light, fulfilling Liora's vow with felt cost ("empty satchel and a lighter heartbeat"). Who/where/when anchored early through "dawn," "grotto," and "Liora."

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (moss hum, condensation trails, resin flakes) build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where two isolated figures find shared purpose in transforming a dead space. The cost is visible in Rowan's tears becoming "another mineral" and both accepting vulnerability "monitored only by moss." The pattern of transformation (servers→garden, wounds→growth) charges the final image of dreamers "wrapped in roots they had chosen together."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching through the three cameo visitors building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Declan accepts endless creative struggle. Cost is visible in "I hope to walk against the current of my own despair and still arrive singing" - accepting perpetual difficulty. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, mist, writer at desk) establish clearly by line 3. Deduction for the conceptual cost being more stated than fully dramatized in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Resonant Reconfiguration where the vine blooms and the Arbor Heart awakens. Closure lands with visible cost (Orin's exhaustive preparation, the decades of blight) and the final image of him crafting future tales shows ongoing price. Slight deduction for predictable arc once the mechanism is established.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Arren transforms scattered heartbeats into a coherent star-chart that reweights the withered orchard from "regret" to "directions." The accumulative structure builds through ritual steps—pooling starlight, aligning plate with trees, arranging objects, sealing with breath—each adding density until the final crystallization. Cost appears in "tears warmed his eyelashes" and the patient endurance required, though it could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—the mended timer storing echoes transforms the town clock into a vessel for recovered wonder, with visible cost in the "wounded season" healing. The accumulative structure coheres as each echo experiment builds toward the final synthesis. Minor orientation wobble around "peripherally focused" but the pattern teaches itself through repetition and pays off in Silas's final smile.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Olivine measuring her own burden at twelve drams and integrating it into her work, creating clear before/after stakes. The accumulative structure coheres around the burden-collection pattern, though the orientation anchors (who/where/when) could be cleaner in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time serving as the decisive intensification that reweights grief into creative practice. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms "here and gone" from wound to reverence, with cost visible in the deliberately missing stroke—"Absence, too, can roar." The magical realism element is taught early through sensory cues and pays off when the lion's roar enters the wood.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with surreal logic that coheres internally. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlo fills the ghost's cavity with stolen fragments, transforming from thief to carrier of stories—a clear before/after with felt cost. The kinetic lagoon's time-distorting mechanics and the camera wheel's role are established early and pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Milo's successful resurrection of the hydroponic system, with clear cost in his physical labor ("knuckles black with sealant") and the emotional weight of working alone in abandonment. The accumulative structure coheres as sugar-water flows transform from carnival waste to garden sustenance. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias reconceptualizes his failed chronometer dream as belonging to silence itself, with clear emotional cost shown through tears and the monastery's "weeping condensation." The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern intensification. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the monastery setting.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with the narrator becoming "part of the legend" and choosing to expose the truth despite risk - a Decisive Change with visible cost. The because/therefore linkage from discovery to moral choice to action is clean. The sundial's evolution from timepiece to moral compass provides persistent constraint. Slight deduction for the station man's arrival timing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from dock to fulgurite discovery to acceptance of guardian role, with the rope's decoded message providing causal linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Sera accepts indefinite waiting with the cost felt in "the oceanic hush inside my ribcage." However, the weavers' nature remains somewhat abstract, preventing full cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates—the piece builds through descriptive layering and metaphorical resonance rather than causal turns. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Peregrine discovers "my own healing had already found its first coordinate," reweighting the entire exchange. Cost is felt through Selene's vulnerability and isolation. Minor orientation delay (princess appears late) but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and resonance build toward the palace's descent with chains unclasping. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the rigid mechanical world transforms through the bird's hatching, with visible cost in abandoning the suspended safety for fertile but uncertain ground. Causality tracks cleanly from discovery through hatching to symbiosis attempt, though the rapid systemic transformation (gears flowering) strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the lagoon ritual as Resonant Reconfiguration, with Maia's whispered vow and the coin's descent creating visible transformation ("woodsmoke lifting from her skin, departing like forgiven ghosts"). Cost is felt through tears and the scar's response, though the metaphysical elements ("lagoon sang when sky grazed water") strain credibility without clearer grounding in the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: breadcrumbs → Novara → argent thread discovery → geese manipulation → fountain restoration. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (centuries of silence broken, city transformed). The sidereal patience pays off when Aurin waits for fountains to find their rhythm. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the quest mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elinon misaligns the gear, creating "gaps...where alternatives could germinate" with the cost of knowing "change can bruise as well as mend." The accumulative structure coheres through the nebula garden frame, though the Mneme Line appears late without earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument transforms private griefs into shared recognition. The accumulative structure coheres well—ribbons marking stations, butterflies as temporal markers, poems as emotional braiding. Cost is visible in Len's exhaustive journey and the community's recognition of their own grief. Slight deduction for the abstraction of "thundering calm" not quite landing with full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias's confession transforms both internal and external balance—"That beat rang through the tower, the ridge, and the village, aligning them like teeth of a gear." The accumulative structure builds through catalogued wrongs to final release with visible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of incremental healing early and pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from cemetery whispers through tapestry discovery to final delivery of forgiveness. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Milo places the sovereign case under Rowan's hand, allowing buried regret to surface for healing. Cost is visible in Milo's nocturnal labor and the emotional weight of mediating between living and dead. Slight opacity around the exact mechanism of how intentions become tangible weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Estra's written intervention manifests as the modular mills, with visible cost in the "fresh ignorance sprouting at the edges." The accumulative structure coheres well, building from maps of ignorance through brass engines to the kingfisher quill's deployment. Slight deduction for the convenience of the immediate manifestation without more struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from radio discovery through lyric decoding to dust animation, with clear cost (exhaustion, risk from regime). The closure—dust carrying stories as spores through everyday sounds—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the suspended mask crystallizes Silas's artistic philosophy with felt cost in "the sight threatens to stitch old griefs anew." The accumulative structure coheres, building from dust ghosts to the final chair's "infinitesimal sway." Deduction for slightly delayed orientation and some opacity around Liora's role.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through sedimentary metaphors toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where both philosophers accept hybrid truth-seeking. The cog's placement in the sextant creates a decisive moment with clear cost—both must abandon pure positions. Orientation anchors (post-plague sunken city, Corvin in sewer) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as the rosette transforms from mysterious object to catalyst for civic harmony, with visible cost in the choir's surrendered grudges and Mara's departure. The accumulative structure builds through nightly rehearsals toward the councilors' arrival, creating coherent pressure. Slight weakness in the councilors' transformation happening too easily without sufficient dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the village's collective rewiring through shared taste creates visible transformation with cost (processing war memories, accepting change). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the communal meal's payoff. Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of memory-editing prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change when protagonist restores city power through solving riddle and speaking truth, with visible cost (blackout's impact, ritual requirement). Causal lens holds: because drones failed → therefore blackout → therefore protagonist investigates → therefore solves riddle → therefore power restored. Opening orientation anchors who/where/when effectively within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the house transforms from "merely listening" to "quickening breath" with visible cost in the wishbone offering and paint chips realigning. The piece teaches its displacement method early and pays it off when Mara's ritual awakens the house. Slight deduction for the abstract "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" which momentarily breaks the otherwise grounded causality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as statues reanimate and begin "cultivating nuance among ruins once built for certainty," with visible cost in the erasure of previous questioners.

Orientation anchors (underwater city, statue guardian, forgotten garden) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through mathematical proofs, dice rolls, and staircase imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marlen achieves "stillness" and releases his obsessive loop. The transformation from "ascending" to "landing" with the staircase continuing without them creates visible cost and closure. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly within the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds from greenhouse tending through brush discovery to luminescent letters affecting the city below, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when strangers remember kindness. Cost appears as Ravi's exhaustion ("curled between tomato vines") and the brush dimming after use, though the transformation mechanism strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the community transforms from passive fear to active cultural preservation, with visible cost in the risk of exposing the lens and depleting resources. The accumulative structure builds from individual dread through collective action to earned hope. Minor orientation wobble with "us/we" pronouns needs earlier anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Sable accepts a path "neither empire nor cataclysm, simply liberty from the great clock above" with visible cost of loneliness and lost possibilities. The yoyo-to-lighthouse mechanism creates strong causality, and the final image of walking "toward a world she had initiated" reweights the opening desire. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through surreal carnival imagery toward a Decisive Change where fear shrinks to a "photographically cursed thumbnail." The cost appears in Eli's "clasp-shaped void" and the warning that "fear breeds heirs," though the dreamlike logic occasionally obscures causal linkage between the dictionary's paradoxical notes and their effects.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (chains loosening, storm modulating) that reweight the dominant stake of transforming barriers through sound. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira accepts impermanence, trusting "the sea to carry her compositions farther than wax or wires"—a conceptual cost of choosing transience over legacy. The orientation anchors (prophet, orchard, driftwood circle) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Corin accepts personal transformation as the cost of knowledge. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern languages building to the watchers' revelation. Orientation anchors established early (Corin Rells, Shellward City, after gate closure). Cost is visible in "every hinge in my own soul must crack open too."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the caretaker's choice to expose truth, with visible cost in "the hush that follows a confession finally spoken."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maris stamping the false codex as waters rise, with visible cost in the library's destruction and her permanent exile. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build pressure toward this crystallized moment. However, the cost could be more visceral—we get "she knew she could never return" but the emotional price of losing the library feels somewhat muted in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (cranes, shadows, steam) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where mourners receive borrowed shadows and Lyra achieves painful compromise with grief. The closure lands with visible cost—tears still refract light into "sharp halos"—and the journey from crafting lanterns to releasing healing cranes traces clear causality. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Lyra, lantern maker, archipelago) though the shadow-detachment worldbuilding could ground earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change when Ashraf sacrifices the geode to neutralize the energy node, with clear cost ("hollowed him of doubt"). The causal chain from wedding blast to energy discovery to final sacrifice maintains integrity. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the drive lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the search for "the frequency of belonging" transforms from external quest to internal attunement, with visible emotional cost ("tears silvering her cheeks"). The accumulative structure coheres through the matrix chip's revelation sequence. However, the transition from technological manipulation to metaphysical discovery strains plausibility slightly, and some causal links between the chip, telescope, and revelation feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the watch hand discovery triggering Elias's return, the driftwood carvings revealing his suppressed memory, and his speaking the brother's name creating closure with visible cost ("something inside him quell, not disappear, but settle like sand"). The "sieved hush" pattern accumulates through repeated filtering imagery, though the cave revelation arrives somewhat abruptly without fuller groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's final act of threading the silver twine through the drawer pull—transforming binding into connection. The cost is felt in "mistakes begin loosening, threads ready for recycling" and chains "already remembering how to open," though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: Gideon accepts Marina's offer to share navigation duties, acknowledging his limitations while the "backlash of regrets grew quieter."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: the piece builds pressure through pattern and ambience, then pays it off causally in the vault with a clear reweighting when he exposes his heart to the lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: light replaces words and confiscations are released, with a conceptual cost (self‑exposure and surrender of control). Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when). The only limiting factor is that the cost is more conceptual than visceral, though still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: polishing → maze reconfiguration → sundial corridor → sealing the crack → needle shifts to “Gardener.” Orientation is firm from the misted maze entrance and holds through a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from hush → ritual → bead spin → “SHIFT SETTLED,” reweighting options and knowledge. Closure lands on the page with cost: the guilt is measured, a path to disclosure remains foreclosed, and the wheel becomes a private metric. Orientation is clear early (abandoned train tunnel; two characters; object on a crosstie), and setups (radio callers/Morse) pay off in the pattern. The final refusal to pursue the whistle reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: patterned images (swan, silence, glass, flood) reweight the stake until a Charged Poise close.

Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the rope’s constraints persist through closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he patterns futures, pays with the rope and a shifted dawn. Hairline note: the avoidance of a binary sacrifice could dull causal bite, but the cost proof (“rope…shorter and more frayed,” altered dawn) sustains consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant: sound patterns and echo-mapping build to a charged reconfiguration where silence is “unbound.” Causality holds cleanly (bowl harmonic → echo mapping → story tremolos → sapling located → strings sacrificed → whistle → music).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors (amber grotto at dusk, clandestine transaction). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via ritual, color-cues, and careful timing to a Charged Poise closure. On‑page costs exist (memory fog; lingering patience the narrator refuses to own). The final image reweights prior material without mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal throughline is clean: misaddressed envelope → search → notices/gathering → sender identified → community action → Mara’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: storm powers coils → forgotten coil introduces asymmetry → spatial mutiny intensifies → he adapts tactics (retuning) → partial closure with a conceptual repricing (“goodbye is…a coordinate”) and a forward commitment. The single meaningful tightening (the dislodged tile revealing the second coil) is strong and earned. Cost is legible in the resisted step and the acceptance that the full answer demands a dangerous quest. Hybrid drive lands with causal turns supporting a resonant end image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: Corvus’s coercion → Mara’s wait → shard drop → concealment → body‑bag ruse → automated transfer → escape. Closure lands with cost (Corvus dead, moral debt acknowledged) and a reweighted rule‑set about “fair exchange.” Orientation is crisp from the opening; single scene holds. A mild plausibility stretch (automated doors/a.m. routine) doesn’t break the because/therefore spine.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence → hum → prism → birth-date test → avalanche deepening → concealment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: history as loom, town’s inhalation versus Calix’s cost, the notebook hidden. Cost is on-page (bodily grief, bonsai rupture, the hum’s cessation as window closes). Structure is clean, single scene with a decisive intensification tied to the method.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density and patterning build to the charged act of sliding the label under the door and recommitting to ghosthood. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a chosen namelessness that carries risk and cost. Persistent constraints (tide, labyrinth, bureaucratic death) shape options. Orientation is clear early and coheres through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, sound-memory actions escalate coherently: cello → shell → logbook → telescope → confession → reweighting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the compass is a phenomenon and then internalized, with cost made tangible by the snapped string and falling letters. Orientation is crisp from the first line and the pattern taught early pays off. The final exit before dawn seals the after-state without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: encoded-parade distraction → heist → rumor leverage → delayed vote → organizing/legal push → public trust. The drive lens reads mainly causal with an accumulative flourish; orientation is immediate and stable. The theft sequence resolves a bit easily, reducing felt on-page cost at the peak. Closure lands decisively with the dais-setting, but the price is more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when and intent by ~120 words), and cause flows cleanly from set‑ups (vial trigger → flares → phased photography). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the hush lifts, drones intrude, and she descends carrying the grain’s “silence,” with the conceptual cost of a final unmanufactured morning made explicit on the page. The live clock (sunrise and “heaters tomorrow”) shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is crisp: diagnose → patch → imbalance revealed → counterweight calibrated → launch and guidance delivered. Orientation is immediate (Grafton Station at dawn; shop, captain, harbor clock), and the ticking anchor elevates urgency. Closure arrives on‑page with the drone’s return and the synchronized whistles, a resonant earned stasis. The felt cost is modest (time risk and trust), but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with accumulative lyric): condensation → buoy shifts → crack → grate → descent → memory‑only atlas, lands with on‑page closure. The cost is legible: paper forbids, forcing a renunciation that reconfigures the atlas and stakes. Setups pay off cleanly (falcon herald, dog‑eared phrasebook, singular convergence). Single continuous scene with crisp anchors and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: walking cadence builds pressure until the fork hums and time folds, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure when Lira accepts stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the opening plaza/archway anchor. The cost is implied but legible (renunciation of flight; duty assumed). The sequence of loops around town functions as a purposeful pattern rather than “and-then” plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: distress pulse → temple → beacon → trapped scholar → micro-precision retrieval → ascent. Constraints (oxygen, hypoxia, tripwires, potential collapse) shape tactics, and the beacon sync pays off previously seeded protocol without feeling like a cheat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: guardianship replaces trespass, with a priced reprieve. No orientation debt; single POV and scene hold steady.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean single‑scene causal build: hush → secret chamber → lattice‑labyrinth → approaching patrol → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses the escape into the labyrinth and reorients to communal truth at a cost. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the warden’s arrival tightens options without coincidence solving anything. The final image reconfigures stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: ghost appears → bead inserted → apple split → seeds rewrite possibilities. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Seraphine gains mortal flush then dissolves; Elias is left altered but alone. Orientation is crisp from line one; single scene with one clean transition outside. Slight softening comes from the ritual’s near‑frictionless success, but the cost holds the end.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a primarily causal lens, beats link clearly: couplet → downdraft → plate reveal → hall of broken tools → sewing → loom activation → new corridor. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the first paragraph, and the labyrinth’s rules are learned via action. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood pledge) and a decisive change (a thoroughfare created). The throughline holds cleanly without soft resets or convenience saves.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: return → excavation access → crack → stair → etchings of interrupted journeys → decision to rebuild → sundial’s shadow reorients path. Closure lands on‑page with cost: a risky descent and the choice to remain, reconfiguring the narrator’s trajectory. Hybrid lens dominated by causal turns holds steady to the end. The final image (new arm ticking/trust returning) seals a decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: details and motifs accrue toward a conceptual repricing when Mirielle realizes the emoticons are keys and reframes her vocation. Orientation is crisp early; one continuous scene with a clear cadence shift around “This will be my last letter.” The cost is a modest but legible renunciation and the weight of the promise (“Your margins will finish my work”). Causality is soft but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal dominance holds: embroidery → revelation method → Voren’s intrusion/confiscation → candle-enabled reconstruction → decision window. Closure lands as a charged poise: she departs to act within a two-hour vulnerability, with the felt cost of exposure and the loss of her daybook. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single-scene structure stays coherent. A hair more on-page consequence would push it past the band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern of spirits/shard/condensation builds to a cadence shift where the shard overflows and truth is spoken. Orientation is clear early (mangrove labyrinth, medium, unsent letters), and closure lands with cost as moonlight heals the opened wound. Setups (condensation, shard, late moon) pay off causally within the lyric frame. The final image reconfigures options (from drifting to deciding) without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via notes decoded → acrostic → sentence found, with the shellfire cadence shift tightening the beat. Closure is a Charged Poise/RR: the line is spoken, the coral returned, and a cost remains (guns continue, promises fragile). Orientation is clear from the outset (field hospital, archipelago, translator). Minor softness in causal stakes (no external test of the new sentence) prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: each step (“therefore” chaining from film → fragment → network nodes → offering) tightens toward the revelation and revival. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/why). Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (memory reclaimed; orchard revived). The emotional cost is present but light—she relinquishes her journal and self‑exposes to memory, not a heavy loss.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean from the first line (Ada, mural, Sound Wave Garden; solstice deadline), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as sound-rituals scale to nested awakenings. Because/therefore coherence is strong: question → echo-answer → negotiated price → ritual sequence → citywide effect. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city’s certainty is loosened, with Ada’s final “listening for the following question” a charged poise. The cost is felt but primarily conceptual; a brief on‑page counterpressure (someone objecting, or a visible risk) would sharpen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: fog cover → betrayal → drones/auditor → vine question marks loop sensors → airflow reversal → escape and charged plan. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when/why), and the single dominant stake (plant the message and escape) stays coherent. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/CR: seed planted, copy secured, options reconfigured toward “a sentence” tomorrow under ongoing cost. Cost is present (betrayal, live pursuit, taxed cognition) even if not bodily loss.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: postcard arrival → guided ascent → elder encounter → garden → planting → lullaby harmonizes → sleep. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the inner war ceases and sleep becomes possible with poems “dreaming on their own.” The cost is the relinquishment of a long-held posture of suffering and the safety of the labyrinth. Orientation is clean from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine. Repairing the cracked chime via song opens the forbidden corridor, descent awakens names, and the return reconfigures the library into archive‑garden—a resonant reconfiguration with a visible ongoing cost (endless remaining names, lingering regret). Orientation is immediate and stable. The closure lands on page without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: translation → archive responds → tactic (interconnected promises) → twilight oath‑singing → treaties inked and reweighted silence. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual price (risk of the archive, spent ink/lantern dimming, heirloom absorbing promises), though cost is gentle. Orientation is crisp from line one; single POV window holds. The neat success of the delegates undercuts maximal pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: surge detection → sluice calibration → partial relief → new fissures → renewed stance → successful venting. Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, why) and the single-scene structure holds. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: danger abates but the ongoing constraint is named and accepted. Cost is legible in her spent body and the foreclosed fantasy of a permanent fix.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust → notation → pigeons → release, with a clear cadence shift at the skylight opening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she chooses to send the stone despite interception risk) with visible cost (burning names/diagrams). Orientation is clean early; the meteorite and attic rules remain consistent. The final image reweights prior motifs into a new stasis charged by risk.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrete (wood grain → weather code → torn page → fragment) to a Conceptual Repricing where distance becomes choreography rather than abandonment. Orientation is clear early (Mira at the prism terrace with Arin). Closure lands on the page with cost—the choice to keep distance, postpone “being found,” and guard the hush. The motif network tightens coherently rather than via plot mechanicals.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric deepening anchored by causal steps: arrival → calibration via breath → feather unlocks archives → cosmic reply → timed exit under alarms. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns the feather, accepting loss to gain belonging. The surface sunrise clock and defense-grid inversion impose concrete constraints and cost. Orientation is clean from the outset and consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: seeded images (foam, seeds, glyphs, pool) accrete toward a resonance where emotions restore roads. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the map brightens and a path is re-lit, with the conceptual cost that unspoken feeling erases ways. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single transition is smooth. The cost is subtle rather than sharply felt, keeping it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative mosaic structures a single interval: setup of method, serial “serendipity” payoffs, and a closing cadence as fireworks near. Causality is reframed as guided chance; under that lens the beat sequence coheres and tightens toward the end. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Velasco refuses rescue of the bishop, accepting loss to preserve the system’s ethic and rhythm. Orientation is immediate and stable; the time pressure of the coming fireworks functions as a clean narrowing device.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perception techniques, the shard ingestion, and the writing build pressure and density toward a charged cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands on-page with cost: she completes the cosmic verse, the planet “sighs,” and she accepts anchoring as origin (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is firm early (garden, ban, exile) and the causal weave is clean. The officials’ impending response adds conceptual price without resolving pressure by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pond’s rings set a time pressure and blueprint; the work sequence densifies to the “final pane” cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—beauty refracts through fractures; the town’s perception tilts—with a soft but present cost (deadline, keeping wounds visible). Orientation is crisp from the opening. Slight softness: stakes never truly threaten to fail on the page, tempering the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual gathers charge until Juniper’s arrival forces an outward turn, culminating in a Charged Poise/RR as he reassigns stewardship of “innocence.” Closure cost is on‑page (damaging the relic, leaving space for her sketches, shared descent). Orientation is clean early; no causality slips; the ending reweights prior material without mechanical tying off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, actions build toward the final balloon test and the parchment boat release, delivering Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early (grotto, tools, aim), and set-ups pay off (gauge quiver → golden midpoint → steady needle). The closure cost is the accepted delay and relinquishment of control as tides carry the proof. Stakes remain abstracted, but the cadence shift at the end reweights meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: diaries → negative → Ori’s intent → hum → hatch → capsule → anthem → vow. Orientation is swift and stable; the single‑scene window honors scope. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive choice with cost (forgoing comfort to become guardian). The causal lens holds throughout, though the external danger is relatively low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via time and sound (the hush before bells) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration where the mural alters the city’s options. Closure lands on the page: heartbeat returns, clocks delay, and children’s laughter replaces bells—cost is the risk to the child if they fail. Causality feels coherent within the magical logic; the palm anchoring the stanza is a decisive, prepared move. Minor ease-of-success keeps this from the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene, clean orientation, and a coherent Situational/Hybrid drive: ritual law + dawn deadline compress choices. Closure lands on the page: the leaders sign after the glacier renunciation and the joint stewardship demand; the cost is felt in their balks and Petra’s charged acceptance of ongoing upkeep. Because/therefore logic is intact (ritual → glacier concession → leverage for children). The final image reconfigures meaning without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain under a hybrid leaning causal lens: the lull → the map of cracks → the altar-laying → the call to dismantle siphons → rain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: she undoes her own monument, reweighting the premise at visible cost (“investors cursed,” pumps shut). Orientation is crisp from the first line; no teleports. The echo premise is earned by prior particulars rather than a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens leaning Causal: rumor → descent → woven doors unlocked by untangling → sanctuary reconfigured → city transformed. Orientation is clean early; the sequence reads as motivated steps with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (exposing the sanctuary, reweaving civic order) on the page. The low opposition softens pressure but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bars montage builds a practice, rumors pull him back, and the dome’s acoustics deliver a resonant reconfiguration via reversal. Closure lands with cost when he declines the scholars’ request and answers through echo and offered tools rather than instruction. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the dome motif coheres causally. Escalation is modest but purposeful; the final image reweights the premise without needing a decisive plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the outset; pressure accrues via the interrupted cadence and the unknotted story until the knot rite reconfigures the system. Closure lands on the page: the grotto speaks, the cadence mends, and the ribbon straightens—an RR with a conceptual price (transience, chosen ephemerality). The final aureole and “cadence in her pocket” seal the before/after with cost and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is swift and clear: who (Elien), where (icebound sanctum), when (under aurora) with a defined mission. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ritual actions build density to a cadence shift when the bell releases names. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: he seals the bronze memory and departs empty‑handed, the cost and reweighted stakes legible. Causality is clean from rope rebraiding → wax grooves → bronze casting → release of names.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via storm, riddle, and dance, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—purpose as living vine needing dancers. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single POV and one contiguous scene fit scope. The cost is legible on page (“I know it will shatter eventually”), and the final image reweights the premise without mechanical tie‑ups. Beat‑to‑beat cohesion is strong, though the turn is more tonal than decisively causal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene, clean anchors (who/where/when) within the opening lines, with coherent because/therefore sequencing from alignment to activation to sacrifice. Closure lands on the page: the covenant is acknowledged, the astrolabe is lost, and the tile’s extra row reweights the rule-set. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative cadence that resolves through a decisive act. No loose set-ups or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: silence, shifting grace, and the broken box build toward Tyra’s renunciation, which reweights the world (“the tremulous world steadied”). Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/what’s at stake), and the closure lands on-page with felt cost and a charged final image (the single note). Setups (music box, cellular memory, sanctuary’s nature) all pay off causally or texturally at the end. The price—letting go of resentment bound to a betrayal—registers in body and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story tightens from approach → instrument rigging → coaxing → completion, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dream becomes “fellow traveler” and the fog recasts as panes. Causality is clear within the lyric logic, but the felt cost is conceptual rather than acute, keeping the closure powerful yet gentle. Orientation is immediate and stable; the ending’s cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is crisp within the first lines (who: Seraphin; where: cathedral-orchard; when: dawn, post-exile), and causality flows: rumor → return → sabotage discovered → mending tactics → charged poise ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they’ve bound wounds and chosen to persist despite demolition tomorrow; the price is ongoing exile and exposure, embodied by the ribbon’s surrender. The single-scene pressure coheres under a situational lens. A direct confrontation is offstage, but the on-page craftwork and alliance reconfigure options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the bathroom epiphany shifts options, leading to a ritual act that triggers the orchard’s response and the cameo’s reweighting. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he accepts stewardship and the cost of participation while knowledge remains withheld. Cost is legible on the page (frost rewriting lungs, the cameo smoothing, the self becoming “footnotes”). Orientation is clear early and the two-shard structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: arrival → fractured architecture → diary‑guided navigation → cashier blockade tied to Marrow’s past barter → creative payment → vault opens. Orientation is strong early; the drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric accumulation. Closure lands on the page (vault opening, “tonic note…forgiveness”) with conceptual cost around debt/memory economies. The price is more thematic than personal, but the decisive change is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive holds: causal beats (card → theater → choice → stitched seam → lily‑pad bridge) within a lyric frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: they leave, but must sustain the bridge by telling, and the garden shifts from wardenship to wandering. Orientation is clear from the first lines and supports the ending image. The price is on‑page and specific (“each pad supporting only remembered weight”).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies from tactile gearing to luminous annotation, culminating in a reweighted world (memories restored) and an irreversible mark (dual‑crested seal). Closure lands with conceptual cost: the door seals, vows are recast into the rope, and Maris accepts anonymity. Causality is clean within the fable‑logic; each step leads to the merge and chimes. Stakes resolve without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of sound, ice, and silence intensifies toward the ritual. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—silence meeting silence—on the page, with a before/after clearly felt in the environment. Causality is clean: attempt → failure → reframe → omen → seam → hush; cost is the relinquishing of the tool and the acceptance of a new rule. Orientation is secure early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural; the patterned build (star paths, hush, slivers) culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where the world “leans” toward the light. Closure lands on the page with cost: the prism’s further cracking, the hush nearly devouring resonance, and Lioh’s exhaustion are priced into the final hum. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when) and held. The closing cadence reweights all prior particulars without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via pattern: methodical dating → discovery of the sundial → vision → curatorial choice. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when she omits her own longing, with cost felt and options reweighted. Anchors (who/where/what) are clear early; no causality breaks. The final image reconfigures the premise without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: chant, mosaic, roses, and fireworks accrue into a decisive public reconfiguration. Closure lands on‑page as the fortress mood flips and the drawbridges lower, culminating in the charged act of perforating the star charts. Cost is legible in that sacrificial damage and implied risk, and all beats link coherently from setup to payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ritual → song → foresight → stance crystallization. Orientation is clean; the cicada’s activation causally gates the vision that narrows options. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with a legible cost (foreclosing cathartic confrontation). The causal thread is spare but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: harvest → father’s climb → tactical use of bottled hush → gravity rights → reconfigured relationship. Closure lands with cost (spent vial, surrendered silence) and a resonant repricing of “shelter grows upward.” Orientation is taught early (trellis above clouds, inversion at 9:23) and pays off at the ladder beat. All set‑ups (doll, inversion physics, hospitality trellis) are honored without convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres and escalates via patterned hush (meter needle, storm glass, breath pacing), culminating in a Charged Poise: “the journey has arrived inside me,” notebooks stilled, hush shared. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the tools/payoffs land on‑page. The cost is understated but present in the renunciation of noise and the transfer of hush to departing passengers.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: rumor → ruby flake → waterfall puzzle → orchard → sigil choice → shard‑seeding staircase. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses personal rule to open access, reweighting the throne’s meaning with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the lens holds. Minor softness: the clock (“until sunrise”) doesn’t materially squeeze tactics beyond the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single scene, tight arc, and a clean accumulative/casual weave: ritual → shimmer → breath sphere → threshold → passage. Closure lands as Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: Declin crosses and the sanctuary “learns lungcraft,” with Mara accepting the cost. Orientation is immediate and stable. No teleports or unkept setups; the ring’s wind‑tap and oculus fire pay off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: glitch texts → bolt retrieval → wall activation → corridor trial → socketing the bolt → diamond door → farm transformed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the world’s economy and Cassia’s stance are reweighted; cost is legible in “crushing against her resolution,” the hollowed bolt, and shed timelines. Single POV, one transition, tight scope. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds through the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: sensory patterning → missing crank → fresco clue → winding → sonic confession → decision to suppress. Closure lands as an earned refusal with conceptual cost made legible in the bells, the pocketed cylinder, and the resealed fresco. The hybrid but dominantly causal drive holds throughout. Stakes and cost are on the page at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern early and tightens via the missing‑page void → mercury apple → surrender/name. Closure lands on the page as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: naming the place “Possibility” after relinquishing identity. Costs are explicit and felt; prior beats set up each move cleanly within the mythic logic. Single scene, single POV, and one cadence shift are held with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: dust circle → button → ethical imperative → director hurdle → delivery → charged exchange. Orientation lands early and the single POV holds; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the button reweights identity and choice for both. Cost is legible (procedural risk, emotional exposure, time pressure before emancipation). The ending’s cadence crystallizes options without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: gala cover → key/hatch → trolley → lagoon → spool → apparitions → alarms/agent → embodiment of voices → empowered return. Orientation is swift and stable; the hybrid causal/lyric design holds with a clear on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: she becomes the carrier of dangerous testimony and exposes herself to the regime. No unkept setups; the phone‑booth logic and puddle‑map payoffs are earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with strong causal threading: rehearsal → corridor of notes → prism refraction → dissolution. Orientation is crisp early; the mechanics of the glasshouse and code are learned through action. Closure occurs on‑page with a tangible before/after (prophecy dissolved, silence “vested”) and a modest cost (exertion, chosen secrecy). The pressure arc is clean and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: silver leaf → verse → hidden mound → sealing act → staircase → first seed → repriced ending. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: she gains the primordial seed and resumes work under a new charge. Cost is legible in the “tender weight of destiny” and the limiting clock (“lasts but a night”), though it’s quiet rather than acute. Orientation is clear early; the hybrid lyric mode stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture carried by a clean causal spine: message → shard match → hatch → vault → choice. Closure lands on the page via a decisive act (smashing the compass) with conceptual cost (releasing pattern from capture). Orientation is clear early (workshop/conservatory) and the sequence tracks logically through the waterfall corridor. The lens stays coherent through the ending’s conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: coin → melting → insufficiency realization → confession → realloyed coin → footprints → reconstitution. Closure lands with on‑page cost as she confronts her pride via the mirror and pays by admitting fault to activate the rescue. The Drive Lens reads Causal throughout with a clean Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (relationship restored, stance altered). No orientation debt; world logic holds within the piece’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single, coherent causal arc: find the harp → coax whispers → recognize inadequacy → deploy the tooth → lattice → release → reconfiguration. Closure lands decisively with object and world change (tooth turns clear, harp snaps into tune, gorge “hums with beginnings”). Cost is legible (“absorbing pain,” tear‑through, the tooth’s spent clarity). The hybrid drive (lyric accumulation supported by clear causal turns) holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensation→ritual→recalculation→repricing; orientation is clean by ~120 words (post‑anesthesia in a forest with drones). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when mercy shifts from constant to transformation, with on‑page cost (pain, risk, and the necessity to expose vulnerability). Setups pay off (strap as conductor; drones halted by sanctuary rules), and causality remains coherent within the taught logic. Minor reliance on metaphoric mechanics never obscures the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the object is acquired, the vision deepens via painting, then necessity tightens to “return to water,” forcing the sky substitution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration when the shard dissolves into “pure direction,” with the cost of surrender explicit. Orientation is clean early (alchemist’s market, rooftop bridges, lens), and beats link coherently. The pressure is lyric rather than causal, but turns are motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening (who, where, when), and the causal chain is clean: power → observation → inference → crawl → retrieval → ghosts at rest. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost: extracting the mainspring reconfigures the space and its spirits. The price is primarily emotional rather than tactical, keeping the stakes modest. Hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost-reading → whisper → composition → press → rupture → reconfiguration, with visible costs (catalog collapse, world rescore). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “Now is always” alters the rule-set and remaps meaning on the page. Orientation is clear early and pays off at the end via the frost index becoming the new order. Causal links are clean within the chosen lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: storm arrives → precaution reframed as tactic → experiment → inscription → council concession → reconfigured mission. Closure is on‑page (council concedes) with conceptual repricing as Velen pivots from proof to building the future. Cost is legible in “bronze smoke” grief and the parallel to failed rebels. Orientation is strong from the outset; the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: crow’s delivery → summons to chamber → guardians’ test → cleansing via names → rust arc clue → philosopher’s chip → tether through his breath. Closure lands with on-page cost: “Clay could never lie again,” a decisive change with persistent consequence. The hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds cleanly. No orientation debt; single scene with one transition is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: factory hush → descent → visions → lagoon → platform → hinge‑doors → luminous question mark. Closure lands on the page with cost as the narrator releases bottled memories and commits to the unknown. Orientation is crisp early (factory, night, basement), and the compass/psychometry chain sustains coherence without cheats. The conceptual repricing—questions as the only “souvenirs”—reweights all prior collecting.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: lost at sea → archway threshold → lantern projection → emissary acceptance → gate completion → communal passage. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: a harbor “larger than longitude” and villagers stepping through a charged artifact; cost appears as renunciation of the initial delivery and days of labor. Orientation is clear early (skiff, fog, GPS fail), and motifs are paid off. A hairline gap: the emissary pact’s obligations are conceptual rather than tested on-page under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: promise → cathedral access → microfiligree discovery → applied mural and unveiling. Orientation is firm early, and the linkage is motivated without shortcuts. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration: night redefined as presence and communion, enacted by the mural’s awakening. The cost is soft but legible (ephemeral art; carrying forward an inherited quest).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive: causal steps (diary → coordinates → lagoon → code → parley → routes) carried by an accumulative lyric density. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lagoon shifts from starless to “storied,” and her seizures convert into anchored memory with recorded testimony, a visible cost having been paid. Orientation is clean from the opening and the two‑shard structure (zeppelin to shore) is seamless. The temporal bridge’s instability adds a concrete time pressure that tightens the endgame.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: mapping via working memory → recognizing the bottle’s mirroring rule → feeding it town fragments → solving the trap with sparks → self‑sacrifice. Orientation is solid from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands decisively with on‑page cost as he enters the vessel, reconfiguring the town’s life with his own. Constraints (bottle only accepts town objects) persist and shape tactics across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the beats accrete cleanly from discovery → cistern ritual → apple instruction → planting at the foghorn. Closure lands on page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s emotional field lightens; the scribe accepts a new ethic (archive by letting go). Cost is legible: he relinquishes control and endures uncertainty to alter the orchard’s charge. Orientation is early and firm; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is tight: hatch → vortex → tunnel → mirrors → repair at cost → sowing → thaw, each because/therefore link escalating the ritual. Closure lands on the page with cost: she’s older and the world reconfigures toward thaw (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is solid from line one (who/where/when), and the lens (hybrid with accumulative cadence, causal spine) holds. No teleports or rule-breaking conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean Causal lens: observation → interpretation → device signal → conflicting pressure graph → choice → consequence. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands in an on‑page decisive change (the switch) with a legible risk cost, then is validated without undercutting causality. The quick storm validation softens the lingering price but not the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the alarm → investigation → mapping → ritual repair → release forms a clean progression toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page: repairing the glass/starlet and reconfiguring Janus’s role (“silent abbot”). Cost is implied (deferring protocol, risk in opening the hatch) rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of exceptional. Orientation is clear early and the throughline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: search → discovery → patience test → covenant deciphered → acceptance and hum that reconfigures the world. Closure is on-page and costly, with Orin foreclosing ordinary solitude to serve as resonant steward. Orientation is clear early; set-ups (iron vines snapping at haste, contextual clues) pay off. Only minor: the “hours, or perhaps a drift of moons” blurs temporal pressure but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: pressure builds through discovery (silo → safe → urn) and culminates in a communal ritual that reweights time. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Basil’s cost is his slipping allotment and surrender of the chronometer. Orientation is clear early (where, who, what’s wrong with time). The throughline from rumor to retrieval to ritual is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive toward a resonant reconfiguration. The decisive on‑page shift occurs when the feather becomes the kite’s spine, reweighting the premise with a tangible price. The pattern (harmonizing discord) is taught early and pays off in the village softening and the kite’s flight. Closure lands quietly but undeniably with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear and held: work accrues (wiring → humming canopy → dolphins) to the charged listening where runes surface and meaning reconfigures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the village perceives shared branching math while Mara lies among roots, her pulse braided outward—cost and before/after are legible. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/why). No causal breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative with causal spine: meteorite message → UV footprints → reactive amber → brine mirror → portal. Closure lands on the page with cost: the path erases behind them, catalysts are consumed, and they cross a threshold that forecloses retrace. Orientation is clean from the opening tower to the cliff plinth. The final image functions as a conceptual repricing of “pilgrimage,” paid for by irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from seed prep to avian liturgy to tidal/mist response, culminating in sprouts and a reweighted world. Closure arrives on the page with cost and change: war ground becomes garden, “battle lines…redrawn by chlorophyll,” and he commits to an ongoing circuit. Orientation is clean from the opening; the reef’s prior death coherently motivates tactics. The cost is more conceptual and elegiac than visceral, but it’s felt and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: Barrow’s leaf → phonograph → coordinates → sealed hatch → archive → decision to journey forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: leaving the scrapyard through a night’s cost, revaluing silence and “tinted revelations” as nearness. Orientation is anchored early and stays coherent. Minor convenience magic (waxed leaf softening lead) sits within taught world logic and doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens via the slit opening and the intercom order, culminating in a charged final act (paper ship, choosing to walk). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: confusion transforms into exploratory stance with a felt cost of solitude and deferred contact. Orientation is clear early; lens holds. Costs are quiet rather than severe but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: wrong sky reveals map → approach → negotiation → ceremonial swap → sky reconfigures. Closure lands on‑page with a conceptual price: certainty is dismantled; she departs without loot. Pressure is modest—the Curator yields with minimal complication—so escalation feels gentle rather than tightening. Still, the single-scene structure holds and resolves decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the interregnum and Calypso’s pressure force a stance crystallization about who will own the whispers. Closure lands on the page with their pact and the act of “unbinding” via microphones—an RR/CR that reweights ownership of memory. Costs are conceptual but clear: Ezra relinquishes monopoly and binds himself to a precarious ally; Calypso trades leverage for legitimacy. Orientation is clean from the opening image; causality is coherent through patterned actions (walking scripts → CHECKMATE).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: seer’s warning → feather‑map guidance → discovery of stone → reorganization tremor → seeding journals → home‑word aligning corridors. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: home reframed as carried direction, mountain exhales, exit revealed. Cost is legible (risk of being sealed, the ongoing obligation to “keep planting verses”). No major orientation debt or lens wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: tapestry decoding therefore partial loosening; therefore labyrinth reordering; therefore recognition that the last key is internal; therefore spoken confession and forgiveness; therefore the hush unravels. Orientation is crisp from the outset (exiled chess tutor on a frozen‑time road into a village). Closure is on‑page with a felt price: he accepts the path where the prince still dies. The drive lens reads primarily causal with elegant textural reinforcement from thunder‑lull beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: spire reveals the price, therefore Vera pivots to refractive confession and negotiates freedom through a poem; therefore the Marshal tears the warrant. Orientation is clean from the opening and the beats flow logically. Closure lands with cost: she foregoes absolution-as-erasure for honesty and influence, and the warrant’s destruction is an on-page decisive change. The canyon’s “wants honesty” reprices the premise without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene structure escalates cleanly toward a decisive change: realizing the final seam is in herself and sealing it with narrated gold. Causality holds: each narration costs breath and steadies the statue, culminating in stabilizing the workshop once she pays the personal price. Orientation is crisp early; the cistern/pistons clock shapes tactics. The closure lands with felt cost (opening her own fissure) and a charged reconfiguration of the world’s mechanics synchronized to her.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from quay to cave to mirror to return, and closure lands with cost: “Promise kept,” the shell left, the unexplainable preserved. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the wrong‑turn oasis is a functional deepening rather than a coincidence fix. The final painting reconfigures the premise (waves arriving and leaving at once) into a lived rule. The price of transience is legible in the fading tide and the forfeited shell.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single-scene progression: setup of rules → two-signal plan → whisper release → horn blast → waiting → bell result → logbook repricing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation and closure are coherent, and the bell is an on‑page result with conceptual cost (staking belief and evidence). Orientation is immediate; no causality gaps. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing that reweights proof and kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: calls → construction → activation → renunciation, with each beat reweighting the stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the decision to remain and steward is on-page and paid for (hydraulic “blood,” reinforced joints, foreclosed departure). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph and supports the final image. The persistent constraint (station hydraulics fueling the rig) shapes options and locks the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: catalog → search → find relic → pay price (confession) → effect → new plan under social threat. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: filter despair so care can pass, shifting from relic-dependence to communal dissemination. The council threat and Mara’s plea reinforce cost and choice at the end. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (rain, ravine orchard, forager).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal steps: gesture → method of gaps → visions → discovery → stewardship. Orientation is immediate (keeper, dock, twilight), and the riddle escalates into a tangible find that reconfigures duty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he assumes custodianship, reweighting his isolation. The cost—taking on another’s intimate memory during war—registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: mysterious package → ants’ procession → cavern → type‑door → isthmus of labeled futures → choice. Closure lands on‑page with cost as he selects the arch, the door seals, and the creek’s rise enforces time pressure. The lens is Causal and holds through the final beat. The only slight softness is that the material risk remains implied rather than materially punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: horns/final warning → dreams → ascent → grotto/orb → confession/abdication vow → descent with a charged future cost. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (she offers to abdicate and commits to public truth) and a visible price. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without contradiction. The sole restraint is that opposition remains primarily internal, though it suffices at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: arrival → experiment → shattering/injury → visionary fork → renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “revalue success” leads to scattering the colors and sealing the shell, with cost legible in the deferred cure and surrendered control. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the opening lines and stays coherent. Causal links within the lyric mode are clear enough; set-ups (shell, instruction) pay off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal turns inside a lyric frame: the breath‑plane warning triggers the rookie’s descent, which in turn smears the grave’s date, reweighting options. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR when the narrator authors a revised outcome and signs “To Be Determined.” Orientation is early and clean (cabin, assignment, grave) and the pattern is taught and kept. The cost is legible on the page at the turn and colors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural: causal beats (Laleh arrives → donor part chosen → repair → test) accrue to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: cannibalizing the fishermen’s clock, accepting permanent anosmia while “smelling with her ears.” Orientation is clean from the first lines, and all set‑ups (fog, clock, oil) pay off. The external urgency (“birth tonight,” rising river) stays mostly atmospheric, but the on‑page decisive acts and final cadence shift hold.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions escalate meaning and risk to a clear closure beat. The on‑page cost is explicit (blood mixed with stress‑crystallizing tea; unsanctioned rune) and reconfigures the platform and her stance. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, single scene, single POV. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration charged by a decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp by the first lines: who (Marisol), where (municipal sheet music archive, orchard), when (pre‑dawn under a noon deadline). Causality holds: lilac + coil → summoning → performance → public delay → partial release → final offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: apology carried but incomplete, with a tangible cost (no column, Dulio not whole) and a charged final image (bottle on stump). The hybrid drive leans causal at the end and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held: entry to library → librarian test → spiral court → plea/verdict → reweighted world. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: reality continues “no longer as a secret,” with the mirror of gray and the choice to let go. Causality within the lyric logic is consistent; the price is conceptual but legible on the page. Orientation is clear early; no structural debts.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: hesitation → investigation → crack/billet → key/unfolding → sand/mirror → conceptual repricing → repair. Closure lands on the page with both practical resolution (flow restored) and CR (time reframed as linkage) carrying a felt cost (gratitude and grief, renewed duty). Orientation is anchored early and stays tight to a single POV and place. The cost is more conceptual than perilous, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through motifs (glow, permeability, echo self) with causal nudges (button press → spore vectors → recalibration). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: she redefines security on the page and accepts the cost of changed practice. Orientation is clean from the first sentence and the lens holds to the final “welcome.” Slightly abstract external opposition prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs compound (graffiti/lantern/rain) toward a closure act with cost. Orientation is swift and clean; the two‑shard structure (subway → library) coheres. The on‑page break of the mica pane provides a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The reappearance of the literal lantern is a coincidence, but it deepens rather than resolves pressure and is thematically prepped.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual setup → wrong‑number pairing → uncanny self‑call → reframed closure. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the on‑page RR/CR lands with cost in the self‑address and the “prepaid” quarter. No causality gaps; the “line folding” is rule‑consistent within the taught lyric logic. The final cadence reweights the premise without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is tight: meeting → locket’s rule revealed → pocket’s secret → intervention → photo’s change → mantle accepted. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost; the archivist’s role reconfigures, and the artifact’s rule set is repriced. Orientation is crisp in the first lines, and the single‑scene structure holds. The price is legible on the page (“Carry it only when context changes… meant always”).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor → encounter → ritual → communal rhythm → reweighted understanding. Orientation is crisp by the first third (Ivy Station at dusk, narrator’s aim), and the beats link plausibly through the logistics/reciprocity logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: loneliness redefined as a logistics problem solved by communal cadence and rumor networks. The cost is implied (yielding isolation) more than dramatized, keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; the pattern densifies from sensing notes to internal fusion to the pool and braille constellations. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the stillpoint is internal, and she relinquishes the maternal compass to embody the discovery. Orientation is clear (who/where/aim) and the piece maintains one continuous scene with a single tightening. The final image reconfigures tactics (maps as resonance) rather than routes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from attempt (rekindle and edit) to ethic debate to decisive renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the pen’s final bead seals limited edits; the narrator commits to listening with a conceptual price. Orientation is firm by line one; no lens ambiguity. Because/therefore is less central than cadence/intensification, but the cost is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of silence‑mapping builds to a cadence shift where color‑music erupts. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: Harlan dissolves at dawn and the town forgets Mara’s face even as the music endures. Orientation is clean early (harbor, midnight rule, camera, aim), and the time constraint shapes tactics. The through‑line from gathering hushes to the silent choir to synesthetic payoff is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, taught early via the art‑breadcrumb structure and held through closure. Closure lands on page: placing the ember triggers unlocking shelves and a living‑fire mural, a decisive change with emotional cost and conceptual repricing (forgiveness reframes her past). Orientation is clear early (who/where/goal) despite lyric montage, and causal coherence holds within the chosen lens. The price is legible in the ending beats: surrendering the stolen ember and facing the archive’s verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (rhythmic garden, calibration, glyphs) and escalates through Ira’s syncopations that trigger a collective break from protocol. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the experiment escapes ownership, the lagoon settles under a reweighted rule (“dreams breathed together cannot be owned”), with the price of personal memory surrendered. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and cause/effect remains legible within the lyric mode. The tightening beat is the machine‑stopping hush and release, which cleanly divides before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean Causal lens: maps reveal corridor; key opens chamber; discovery triggers ladder; patrol pressure forces the vent‑whisper ploy; coin becomes evidence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s “loudest hush” becomes actionable proof with institutional stakes. Orientation is sharp from the outset (Pier Seven, night shift, storm), and the single scene holds. Cost is present but modest (surveillance risk and unresolved institutional fight), keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene tightens from atmospheric approach to the explicit rule—“every pattern required a memory”—and culminates in the paid cost. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the secret is relinquished, pain re-priced, options reweighted. Cost is on the page (tears, the surrender of a hoarded memory) and charges the final walk away. Orientation is solid and consistent across a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation → grotto acquisition of the missing puzzle → synchronized reveal that reconfigures the town’s attention. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing: the town’s slowed attention is the win, with the cost being a quiet, unspectacular insurgency. Orientation is clear early and causal linkages are kept. The price remains subtle, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from harbor calm to whale-call revelation to surrender and island solidification. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: he forecloses the land life and commits to a vanishing harbor. Cost is legible in the leaving and the irrevocability of the island’s conditional presence. Causality holds with lyric ellipsis; no plot amnesia or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Situational with accumulative texture; pressure coheres around the mandate and inspectors. Closure lands on the page: the lamp’s glow creates Charged Poise and a Conceptual Repricing—compliance reconfigured to include space for grief—with the social cost of living by subterfuge. Orientation is clear early (farmhouse under turbines; mandate) and the inspector incursion tests the declared stakes. Persistent constraint (mandate/inspection) directly shapes tactics at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens, beats build from lake/atrium to plaza, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: certainty’s tremor redefined as rhythm for change. Orientation is swift and clean; the shard and hum seed the ending. Closure occurs on the page when the columns rise and sing through the poet, with social and internal costs implied (market disruption; fear of lingering censors). The causal thread is soft but coherent: shard → hum → colonnade emergence → communal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—ritual cadence, recurring objects, and density culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the charged image of the phoenix effigy rising as Goran’s stance flips and he seeds a flaw, paying humility and craft‑identity costs. Orientation is clear from the first lines (courtyard at dawn; custom set). The final “even broken eyes can find perfect dawn” reprises stakes without moralizing, reweighting the whole scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who, where, when), and the piece holds a single continuous scene. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, escalating via density and a pattern break (surge → brittle silence → imperfect hum). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the lab ceases to be archive and becomes a vestibule, with cost in vulnerability and renunciation of purity. Props and conditions (grid, lens, armature) persist and shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs accrue (tattoo → origami → compasses → watch → self‑coordinates) toward a Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset (observatory without clocks; Lenore’s status), and the closure lands with dawn and self-as-observatory, with a visible/felt price. Each beat coheres under the promise to “teach withering to bloom again,” culminating in a before/after that reweights meaning. No causality breaks; the cost is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single, coherent scene with early anchors; the accumulative/textural lens is taught through the spiral layout and held to closure. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: rain becomes threads to weave, and the choice to share the “tape” forecloses pure solitude. The price is conceptual/social (surrendering ownership) and on‑page. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks escalate access until the chamber demands a price; the return with “purified” knowledge is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the causality of ritual → opening → surrender → searing → exit reads clean. Cost is on the page (veil given, pain endured) and shapes the final option to carry wisdom outward. The ending’s charged poise—stepping into morning to teach—reweights the premise without tying off mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: comparing reels → spotting the shadow → decision to descend → returning with the stone → on‑page manifestation. Closure lands (the grandmother congeals; book absorbed with conditions), but the cost proof is softened by the charter’s consequence remaining abstract despite Eira’s return. Orientation is clean and pattern is taught early. A brief elision of the descent removes the scene’s hardest pressure from the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: ritual actions intensify toward dawn’s forced stance. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he renounces trickery and steps toward judgment with a repaired sign, accepting ridicule as price. Stakes and cost are on the page (“awaiting verdict,” exile pressure). Minor softness in external opposition presence prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain is clean: anesthesia ebbs → she reopens → discovers displaced miracle → traverses → returns it, with on‑page cost and a decisive change (child breathes; her wound seals). Orientation is clear early (tower at dawn, post‑surgery) and the hourglass provides a temporal spine. The closure image reconfigures “closure” credibly without mechanical over‑explanation. Minor convenience in the swift discovery of the miracle’s exact placement keeps this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the corridor of letters, projector, and emergent tune densify toward a cadence shift when the images and music free the paused love. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: unused love is not stored but circulated, and Mira releases her own. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality is lyric but coherent (relic → reading → projection → release). The felt cost is subtle yet legible in her goodbye notes and relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: meteors → map → comet reveals glyphs → condition to surrender → unlocking → village revival. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis; he pays a clear price (sacrifices his spark) and refuses the quill. Orientation is solid early; the piece holds a Causal lens without contradiction. The cost is legible on the page at the decisive moment and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: clock → Lira → compass test → descent → planting → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “frozen time was exactly the soil,” recasting prior images and tactics. Orientation is clear early; causal links are legible without over‑explaining. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but present in Silas’s chosen vigilance over comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory patterning (wind-as-maps → timbre-as-memories) tightens into the observatory sequence and culminates in a charged reconfiguration as he chooses “the place where questions are born.” Causality is clean (gear completes machine → maps of his mind → frontier revealed → chosen translocation). Closure lands as Charged Poise/CR with a conceptual price: he surrenders to uncertainty and loses the gear, now “ticking” inside him. Cost is felt but subtle, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and detours gather toward a cadence shift when the lantern lights and the path “no longer forked.” Closure is on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—courage is retrieved by vigil, not rescue—and the cost is the tense, time-bound waiting. Orientation is clear from the opening paragraph; no lens ambiguity. Setups (ticket punch, indirect routes, unlit lantern) pay off precisely at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative texture, culminating in a causal act: Ellis twists the bolt, reconfiguring the fortress’s silence into a “vow freely chosen.” Orientation lands early (fortress, role, rule), and cause-effect is clean (arrival → quest → chapel → decision → result). Cost is legible: he breaks an enforced law risking storms to test safety’s price, earning the final repricing. The closure sits on the page with a before/after that feels paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is strong: cryptic warnings → Selestine’s discovery → proclamation tilt → Hall of Mirrors sunder. The closure lands decisively with a reconfigured political reality and visible social cost (kneeling vertigo, shattered mirrors, empty throne). Minor convenience in Selestine “stumbling upon” the rune is acceptable within the taught logic and doesn’t undercut the because/therefore flow.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere and tighten: anomalies → secret cache → map/labyrinth alignment → cavity confirmation → door signal → descent and tap. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she taps the door’s rhythm, with a real price already staked by the note and the literal descent. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. The cost is on the page and the pattern holds to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: image density tightens from hangar to circle to sky and culminates in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing (repurposing satellites, carrying music). Orientation is clean early; the descent and ascent form one coherent arc. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted final image (soldier’s question, her pointing to the sky) and a felt internal price of urgency. The cost is more conceptual than enacted, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain from kite → coordinates → raft → cave → pledge → unsealing, with the kite returning as key. Closure lands on the page: she binds the child to soil (foreclosing throne) and releases it, reconfiguring tradition with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final image (“hammers rang in a new cadence”) seals the change. No loose set-ups; constraints (heat, steam, glyphs) stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tour’s designed somatic sequence builds to the thunder trigger and the pearl‑through‑ruins reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she nearly freezes, regains cadence via Malik’s pulse, and reframes the pearl to refract light through the cracked lens—cost and endurance are legible. Orientation is clean early, and all beats serve the central stake. No causal gaps or outliney “and‑then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative-textural dominant: storm → library → threads → mirror → trapdoor → cave → Moon → surrender forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he abandons capture for surrender with a felt cost. Magical causalities (smoke, shard-water) are taught and consistently used. Orientation is clear early and serves the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: camp investigation → ink grammar → door → revelation of harvested crisis-time → decision to descend. The closure is a Charged Poise with cost: he chooses pursuit of architects over immediate rescue, risking self and delaying the campers’ release. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the pattern (ink grammar as gateway) is taught and paid off. Only slight openness on the mechanics of cost prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a Causal lens, each step (“forbidden letter” → Alcove Seven → dormant networks → transmission → Curator confrontation → reply) follows because/therefore logic. Closure lands with the scarlet reply line—an on‑page reconfiguration with risk still active (no security called, but consequences loom). Orientation is clean early and the single‑scene window holds. The cost is legible in her chosen exposure and the conditional reprieve from Malvek.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is swift and clean (dome, desert rose rows, Pushkar Frontier), and cause-and-effect holds: debris → message → warning → convoy → nonviolent demonstration → negotiation. Closure is on‑page with a felt reconfiguration (glass unbroken; he stays), under a Situational lens. The cost is implied rather than paid (risk of requisition/draft), and the leader’s turn is a touch convenient but not implausible. One continuous arc with a clear tightening through the convoy arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies via density shifts (snarled melody → fracture arrival → constellations’ warning) toward an on‑page choice. Closure is a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: pulling the spike forecloses the capture path with felt cost and reconfigures the world back to equilibrium. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and all set‑ups (net, spike, voice of silence) pay off. The persistent constraint of the window “when patterns break themselves” shapes tactics and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: call → meeting → evidence → ethical calculus → decisive vow. Closure is a Decisive Change with on‑page cost (front‑page printing and selling her estate). The inferred lens is Causal and holds without contradiction. Set‑ups (pen nib, orrery, headlines) pay off precisely at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    A clean causal chain runs from meteor “hush” pressure → discovery of letters → ritual → tethering → verification (untranslated baby cry) → transmission of instructions. Closure lands decisively on the page with a clear before/after and cost: the ghost leaves him, and the city’s sonic order reconfigures. The learned pattern (lost sounds/archives) is paid off by the amber’s final function and the repaired skylight. The hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accumulation) remains steady to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑scene accumulative structure: arrival, gathering pressure, ritual action, reveal, repricing, dispersal. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing—mundane table over prophecy—with on‑page cost (relinquishing the mystique; the tile dissolves). Orientation is crisp early (grotto, mist, festival), and the pattern method is taught and paid off. Escalation is steady and coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens: the pattern of placement → wind tuning → voiced echo → renaming builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when, and damage after the great fire). Closure lands on-page with the city’s renaming and sky’s “veins of silver,” and the cost is the acceptance of sorrow as temper. The causal seams are clean and the ending reweights all prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (textural-lyric accumulation driving a causal act) holds: whispers → coin → mask/metronome → echoes → twin rails → rope → throw → applause. Closure lands on page with a Decisive Change (loop breaks; Lazzaro restored) and a modest, legible cost (narrator’s earned lateness/repriced priorities). Orientation is clear early (mall at night, adjoining theater, hedge maze). Setups (coin, echoes) pay off cleanly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: setup of shutters/algorithm → ingestion → verification via light patterns → intrusion → protocol two shutdown. Orientation is swift and stable (studio, encrypted channel, present-time experiment). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses continuing tonight to preserve safety, with cost on the page. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds; the final ember reweights meaning without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory mapping → fossil translation → fissure surge → invitation → sealing. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: he accepts the role, the corridor seals, instruments power down, and he trusts the map to sing. Cost is on the page and conceptual stakes reweight the premise without tying a mechanical bow. Orientation is clear early (cave network, hibernating world), with no causality cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile procedures compound until the chaos beat (sand in ribbons) forces a tactic shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she opens the doors and the prophecy insists “Share or disappear.” Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final image reweights the rule‑set with a legible price (relinquishing control/vulnerability). The throughline is tight and self-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: coded summons → confrontation → gear repair → decision “go west, together.” Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration anchored by the click and the snow-written directive, with cost (shared burns, risk, history) legible. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when are crisp), and the scene stays within one continuous window. No teleports or logic gaps; the final image meaningfully reweights the opening setup.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: waiting under a time boundary, ritual enactment, silence cadence, and a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands on the page with cost: the coachman recognizes service bound to doubt and surrenders golden strands (former questions). Orientation is clear from the outset and the single-scene structure is coherent. The causal chain is gentle but consistent, with the gutters’ clock used cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density builds toward a Charged Poise/RR closure (choosing to fire the cups when the smoke flattens, accepting patience as price). Orientation is clear early (potter at an abandoned oasis) and pattern is taught and paid off. The closure carries conceptual cost—endurance and delayed action in a dying world—though the on‑page price is quiet rather than acute. Beats link coherently through motif rather than plot twists.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: rose dies → tooth unlocks tower → prism failing → ad hoc fix → need for living steward → bringing Nara → on‑page repair. Closure lands with cost as they assume stewardship and risk Nara’s fragile health to seal the crack. The hybrid but dominantly causal drive holds throughout, with set‑ups paid off cleanly (tooth, rumor of luminescence). The final image reconfigures options for the city and the siblings without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (causal spine within a lyric, accumulative texture) holds: sundial directive → stone circle memory/permission → verb choice → tangible departure. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing: she leaves the floating library to carry resilience below, with visible cost (“library receded,” companionship lost). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what), and no causal slips mar the end. Pressure is earned without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: each passage in the installation builds toward the coil and a conceptual repricing of “keeping secrets.” Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the closure lands on the page with the act of releasing the letter-boat. The cost—relinquishing proprietary secrecy for communal sound—is legible in her earlier worry about archiving and later relief. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the platform satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear Causal lens: signals → decoding → campus pressure → Calvin’s intrusion → inversion broadcast → auroral resolution. Orientation is crisp from the opening booth image, and the escalation culminates in an on‑page decisive act with a before/after. Closure lands: the tricksters retreat and Mina chooses unity over opportunism; cost is implied through the severed power‑play path. Only minor softness in pricing the personal cost keeps it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds: music causes spatial shifts; the compass and negotiation produce access; the choice to keep the key reconfigures stakes. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost as she pockets the key and promises restraint. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words and all set-ups (organ, compass, narrowing) pay off. A single convenience—space answering a promise—works because it’s taught early and consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: quarry → envelope’s rule → oil‑film tracing → decade‑old pattern → dusk confrontation → confession and reopened case. The time skip to dusk is clean and serves the plan; closure lands both externally (confession) and internally (empathy awakening). Slight convenience in the suspects’ quick capitulation softens cost. Lens: Causal with a lyric overlay is held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: journals → phrase → buoy tone → wind shifts → corridor → exchange. Closure lands on-page with felt cost as Marla takes exile and Havel inherits the charged nail. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the persistent constraint (exchange rules) shapes the ending. The causal chain is tight and unbroken by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten coherently from eerie disappearance to negotiated passage to the lens‑bridge climax. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the hitchhiker stabilizes and departs across a bridge created by Avery’s recounting, reweighting his future (“determined to play bridges into being”). The magical mechanics are taught and kept (scaffold flutters, pixelated amnesty, lens). Cost is understated but present in the relinquishment and renewed vow.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive (textural build with causal discovery) holds: ritual → dialogue → algorithm review → realization → charged exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they accept constraints (memorial backroad) and choose a different stance (“walk listening”), with conceptual price (abandoning pure optimization). Orientation is clear early and the single-scene structure is tight. The cost is more intellectual than visceral, limiting peak impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with crisp orientation and a maintained Accumulative/Textural lens. Beats progress cleanly: align star → overlay lightcurves → decode → reprice mentor’s death → broadcast → replies → charged resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (renouncing solitary grief). The causal throughline never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: summon circles → corridor → thorns negotiated → ice mirror manifests failure → truth‑naming breaks it → seed yields vision. Orientation is immediate (dawn at a cursed lake; druid task), and lens holds Causal through closure. Closure lands on the page with cost: she surrenders the “frozen confession” to the deep memory and thereby changes options and knowledge. No teleports or outline beats; each move narrows options or deepens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: glade arrival → communion via scars → received mandate → self‑inscription → maze transforms. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (pain, permanent marks, world reconfiguration), consistent with a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). The single scene holds tight focus with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: vow → descent → rule → insufficiency → greater offer → seed choice → consequence → ballast → exit. Orientation is immediate and stable; one scene holds the pressure. Closure lands on the page with cost (visions of the life forfeited, the bruise/weight that remains) and the lens holds to the end. No dangling setups; the dawn clock tightens departure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: office → cloth → notebook revelation → descent → locker → reels → decision to restore. Orientation is immediate and stable; the quarry’s physical logic constrains movement and tools. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Gideon chooses reverberation over appraisal, with felt cost in confronting Mara and risking renewed visibility. A compact, coherent arc at this length with no causal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: find seed → translate → analogical lament → lattice/presence → conceptual repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“absence transform[s] into an echo he could carry”). Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (Uruk doors, linguistic voltage) pay off in the vocal modulation. Stakes resolve without a hard external test, but the hinge/seed mechanics provide credible on‑page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure accrues from the threat of identities “rotting into sameness” to the smelting song and release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—masks claimed, world revariegated, Silence returns the creel and rests with a vow. Cost is conceptual and felt (working without a future, tending the next breath like flame), though not sharply dramatized as loss. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when) and pattern is taught and kept.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene escalates from discovery (shell) to ritual (pearl) to personal admission, culminating in a reconfigured purpose. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why), and cause-effect within the lyric logic is coherent (confessions → crown → light → hatch). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost at the confession and a concrete aftermath (collecting shells/mission). The only hairline limit is the low external pressure, though the design doesn’t require it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: maps → hatch → culvert → Mara → plan to redirect water → dawn image on rails. Single POV, one scene with a clear progression and on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterned cues (watch clicks, cipher reversals, delayed messages) build to a conceptual repricing. Orientation is early and clean; causality flows through the taught pattern rather than plot twists. Closure lands on-page with cost when she seals the watch, reweighting time and silence. The second-letter reveal reorders events coherently inside the library’s rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning causal: coffee omen → corridor → perforated door → violin → propagation across the city forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration: the empire’s anthem is countered by the earth remembering, with on‑page consequence (banners wilt, crowds hear). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the pattern the prose teaches is kept. Cost is more social/conceptual than personal, but it’s legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: aurora, static, and ritual intensify toward a Charged Poise closure. The on‑page cost is clear—the emerald’s fire is surrendered and a promise binds her to return the spark. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (dirigible monastery, polar night, crystal coffin). Beats cohere causally within the ritual logic, culminating in the sealed circuit and negotiated truce with oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens from entry to ascent to the pool and final relinquishment. Closure lands on the page via the decisive act of placing the hairpin in the water, with cost legible in its dissolution. Orientation (who/where/why) is clear early; no causality breaks. The single meaningful tightening—choosing to let go of the hairpin/identity—reweights options and concludes the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned wind-chime ethics and dawn’s approach build to a reweighted stance. Orientation is crisp (lighthouse at dawn; chime code taught early), and causal links are clean (conscience’s instruction → climb → chime ethic → repricing of the shard). Closure lands on the page with cost via renunciation of verdict and shard. No material causality slips or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from pebble → chalk circle → surrender → trance → vanishing, with coherent because/therefore beats under a textural lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rowan disappears and Mira refuses to summon him, a paid price on the page. Orientation is clear early and the pattern (withholding, delayed revelation) is taught and paid off. The final image reweights earlier motifs (ripples reversing, “sycamore hush”) with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: listening → echo/bird mapping → alignment → pact/renunciation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he grounds power, foreclosing domination, and binds himself to stewardship (“or the canyon would collapse”). Decisive acts (planting the arrowhead; etching the teaching) make a before/after legible. Orientation and world rules are taught early and pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build from balcony → quills → descent → brazier to a resonant reconfiguration: warmth supplants sterile brilliance. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: he reprices “brilliance” and accepts a quieter standard that disrupts the Scriptorium (quills falter). Causality of object use (keystone) and environment (frost, stairs) holds without seams.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is swift and clean (pier, festival night, low tide), and causal steps link smoothly: tip from Sorensen → tide/lantern cover → door seven → ledger → vow → auroras. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: color belongs to resonance/hope, earned by Emil’s spoken vow, with cost visible in the reconfigured world. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with light, tide, and vows building to a cadence break. No plot amnesia or convenience patches undermine the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal spine is clean: prophecy → casting → pulses → clause → decision to depart. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with implied cost to the colony’s survival. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and constraints (coins/bowl/codex) remain consistent. The cost is largely conceptual, not concretely priced on the page, trimming peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of “naming as calming” intensifies, then breaks with the nameless void and resolves via co‑naming. Closure is on the page with cost: the fissure seals, but the echo of sacrifice remains and a lifelong commission follows. Orientation is clean from the first line; each beat coheres toward the end image. The cadence shift at the void’s emergence and recoil is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation lands quickly (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: drip-sequence attempt → cosmic response → overcorrection risk → sweat sacrifice → recalibrated balance. Closure is on the page as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s purpose is rebuilt and the world reweights, with a visible price. No teleports or resets; set-ups (bell’s silence, dripping rates, dawn window) pay off. The final image coheres under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens holds: accumulative trail → causal breach (opens gate) → charged communal dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the decisive act narrows options by buying time at a risk. Orientation is clear early and through-line logic is clean. Cost is present but soft on the page (no immediate repercussion), tempering peak score.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs tighten (starlings, branch, flame) toward a Charged Poise closure when she tempers, not ignites. Orientation is clean from line one (who/where/when), and each step causally deepens pressure (omen → turbulence → price → braid → choice). The cost is on-page: risking loss of laughter if she ignites, collapse of equilibrium if she extinguishes, and she embraces a costly middle path. The final image (figure-eight sky, muted waterfall) reconfigures stakes without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: vigil → convoy identified → Command doubts → she reframes via the buckle memory → proposes revised course → acknowledgment → charged final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: trust preserved for now; she remains on duty with visible cost (exhaustion, refusal to sleep). Orientation is strong from the first lines; the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds. The cost is on‑page and tied to her endurance and role.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (situational with accumulative cadence) holds: the custody dispute tightens into a ritual of complementary breathing that culminates in on‑page transformation. Closure lands with cost: the clones dissolve (orchids/rainfall), Mara weeps seeds, and the jar is surrendered to the lake. Setups (jar, twins’ claims, world rewriting) pay off causally in the ritual’s mechanism and the final repricing of “duplicate.” Orientation is clear from the first lines and leveraged at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story coheres: storm‑born hush → parcel → planting → fissures → midnight sprout, culminating in a charged poise. Orientation is clean from the outset; causal steps are small but tight. Closure lands with a reweighted premise (innovation through discomfort and scent) and a visible new constraint, though the cost is implied rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds through the tunnel and vents to a charged reconfiguration upstairs, with emotional cost legible in the parents’ reactions and the reweighted silence. Orientation is clean from the hourglass to the tunnel; the leaf blower ritual is coherent and causally linked to upstairs effects. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: silence returns altered, with the coil of the pull cord and bow sealing the afterstate. The persistent constraint (tunnel acoustics, blowers’ mechanics) shapes tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pendant discovery → spiral as handle → radiance/images → chosen stance produces a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis close. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the first lines). Closure cost is legible in the refusal to pass through, accepting an ongoing guard’s burden. The final image reweights prior motifs (sundial shadow, margins, boundaries of light) without mechanical explain‑all.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: the ritual’s successive steps because/therefore into the final sacrifice, producing an on‑page Decisive Change. Cost is legible at the end in the humiliations voiced and the surrender of the identity‑mask. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) and the pattern taught early pays off. The nexus’ responsive tremor is pre‑set, so the final repair reads earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a causal lens, each move links cleanly: signal → vision of the fragment → descent → repurpose → environmental revival. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost: the fragment spends its charge and becomes inert, and Mara accepts continuing cycles of endings. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lunar deadline narrows options. The chain lacks any deus ex machina; the decisive act is hers.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal pivot: dense lyric accrual culminates in the hourglass turn that reconfigures reality and returns the ferry. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (hourglass, vanishing ferry) pay off on the page. Closure lands via Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration; the felt cost is conceptual (lives re‑selected, forfeited paths). The price is more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean: setup of rules and stakes → guests’ emotions feed the system → over-tightening threatens eruption → keystone cut relieves pressure at cost. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a clear price (inverting her earliest memory). Orientation is strong from the first lines; the drive lens remains causal with textural support. The afterimage (“forgiving light”) reweights the premise without soft-resetting consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (Silas in Ghyll‑Marrow, post‑surface era), and the piece moves coherently: building the tool → training and observation → trench test → reweighted final stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: navigation becomes “listening for the sky under water.” Cost is present but subdued (risk of “permanent night,” abandonment of old charts), sufficient for this length. The causal chain holds throughout without teleports or retrofits.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive (causal steps with an accumulative sonic crescendo) holds: pulses → door → stair → coordinates → vault → power‑up. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the hush transforms and the city is briefly reweighted by released voices. Cost is legible (sacrificed lantern power; risk in the vault) and tied to the choice. A touch of world‑magic (water mapping coordinates) fits the established rules without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: tide window → descent → console/phase gate → mist‑archives → urged retreat → emergence as the tide closes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines “standing by the unremembered” and accepts an ongoing cost. The tidal clock and power reroute make constraint legible in the final image. No orientation debt; single POV and scene hold cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: radio/shard/ink pressures mount to the decisive sacrifice, enabling the ghost’s defragmentation and a reweighted final state. Closure lands with cost on the page—the tape is surrendered and the memory repurposed—producing a before/after that’s legible. Setups pay off cleanly (ink-reading method, shard’s conductivity, static gate). Orientation is early and firm; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: causal links (birds → route, diamond flaw → resonance, speaking textures → revival) accrue toward a charged closure. Closure lands with visible cost: the diamond cracks and the passage seals as he escapes with the shadow‑ink language. Orientation is crisp early; set‑ups (storm swifts, cursed spiral) pay off at the climax. No major causality breaks or late conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance holds: ladder → lab garden → phone/arrowhead conduit → confession → manifestation → reweighting (“mission logs erased,” inner chirp). Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/why) and the single scene is coherent. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with tangible cost (erased logs, surrendered bitterness) and new option charged by object reprise (chirping arrowhead). Setups (phone, arrowhead, Juniper, spores) all pay off without teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative lyric) holds: heart‑sync → music escalates → chiseling uproots → shell catalyzes → sap returns → charged poise ending. Orientation is clean from line one (who/where/why), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (“the kingdom would brand her traitor”). Setups (shell, statues’ silence, twilight note) all pay off. No causality breaks or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning causal: established constraints (drones, bottle volatility, mail drop timing) funnel to a decisive choice—pouring the storm into “Returned To Sender.” Orientation is crisp early; setups (foil cloak, drone rhythms, chemist warning) pay off in the mailbox act. Closure lands with a felt reconfiguration of options and stakes, though the “cost” is more conceptual than visceral. The sequence maintains because/therefore logic without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: shard discovery → vision in the cavern → building tuned chimes → restorative song → angel’s return and world reconfiguration. Orientation is strong from the first lines (who/where/when are legible), and the hybrid magic rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image. The cost is primarily emotional (risking voice and relinquishing silence’s safety), modest but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure form: Earned Stasis with a Conceptual Repricing. The drawn hyperbolic map → door → invitation/refusal sequence tightens into Hollis’s acceptance that the work is “to shelve silence,” a shift with cost (foregoing seizure, committing to patient guardianship). Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who, where, when), and set‑ups (scarf, geometry) pay off causally in the corridor and final cadence. The cost is legible in the final beats: he locks the scarf away and returns to night duty, altered in aim.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: preparatory patterning (light as pigment, tidal library rules) escalates to the freeze‑sun beat, the dream’s recoil, and the decisive tactic shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses stewardship and releases the sun, accepting the price of not “keeping” the dream, evidenced by retaining only a negative. Orientation is clean and early; causal links are coherent within the lyric frame. The final image reweights the premise without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build cleanly from arrival to star‑aided opening to the city’s reconfiguration; closure lands with the syllable’s release and the city’s charged inhale. The cost is conceptual and social (disorientation, relinquishing ownership to the dreamer) rather than personal jeopardy. Orientation is strong early; the pattern is taught and kept. The ending provides a resonant cadence shift without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: ritual setup → failed attempt → rule reinterpretation → touch → reciprocal offering. Closure lands on the page with cost (she gives her own freshest recollections) and a reconfigured future stance. Orientation is clean, props track, and the lens holds through the ending’s promised return.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning causal: mentor lessons → arrival of Harl → crate breach → shadow weaponized → Rafe’s circle redirects → warrant severed → reversal declared; the chain holds. Closure lands on‑page with cost: freedom possible but refused to honor promises. Orientation is strong from the first lines. The lens holds through a decisive change and a resonant staying choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual actions (weaving, grafting, rooting) intensify until a charged poise lands with a lifelong duty. Closure is on-page: the sapling sings, villagers are reweighted, and the guardians vow seasonal upkeep—a visible ongoing price. Orientation is immediate and clean; causality is coherent within the lyric logic. The lack of overt opposition is offset by the pattern’s tightening (“wonder is motion, not monument”).

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: unraveling knots releases sea‑memories that fracture the hush until the reweighting at the end. A clean mid‑turn reframes the antagonist (not a fisherman but an actor siphoning honor), tightening tactics toward the naming/applause solution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the spirit accepts recognition and settles into the mask; the hush remains but softened—felt cost is the narrator bowing and redirecting applause to the dead. Causality and on‑page payoff are coherent with no loose set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: the patterned comparison of footage and listening builds to a conceptual repricing where mapping becomes an ethic. Causal links are clean (overlay → revealed coastline → hidden panel → corridor → henge → cylinder → vow), and the closure carries cost via restraint. Orientation is strong from the outset; no lens ambiguity at the end. A minor convenience in the quick panel discovery doesn’t undercut the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (wire, journal) deepen the central question and reweight the final stance. Closure lands as a charged poise: the decision to transmit a resignation curve and to release the globe after finishing the model carries conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clean early; causal threads (journal → interpretation → modeling → planned release) are tight. The only limit is that the decisive act (releasing) is just ahead of the final line, not executed on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density builds (color‑code, storm pulses, pivot plate) toward a cadence shift as thunder closes the gap. Closure is on‑page: he encodes, seals the ghost, and departs—conceptual cost is that the work is audible only in the brief hush, invisible to the city. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the storm window constrains tactics. The final image reweights prior material without retrofitting rules.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ascent frames a tightening window; the stall and discovery reweight options; the light‑triggered unlock is a clean because/therefore. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: quoting the diary line alters the relationship on the page with cost (possible exposure, moral breach). Orientation is crisp by 120 words and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and sustained: observations → ballast experiment → data echo → renunciation. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing—the sky “remembers,” and she pays with her body to preserve the proof. Orientation is crisp from line one (gondola, broken string, meteorologist), and each action links cleanly to the next. Cost is explicit on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens: coin → instruction → blindfold craft → crews arrive → consecrated hush. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the mural changes the observatory’s fate; the city rescinds demolition. Cost is present (time pressure, working blind, risking failure under a live clock), though it’s felt more conceptually than viscerally. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative drift: observation→pattern→test→course change→discovery. Closure lands on the page when they bank into the invisible corridor and reach the luminous island; the cost is modest but present (risk, lost sleep, captain’s trust). Orientation is clean from the first lines. The hopscotch grid and birds form a consistent logic that pays off causally at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: ascent → discovery → prophecy assembly → heart retrieval via confession → assembly → remembered rhythm. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices repair and leaves with a living clock; cost is the admission of failure and the tear-pendulum. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The chain remains focused with one meaningful tightening when the “heart” is required.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: arches crack → call via bell/messages → mass repair → new knowledge (arches as conduits) → reframed act (promise‑ring) → nebula’s mist sealing. Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change with Earned Stasis overtones: repaired arches, ghost on watch, chalk gone. Cost is felt in collective vulnerability, urgency, and the risk of mis‑sealing pain outward. Orientation and scope are crisp for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: time resumes gentler at real cost, with a before/after made legible by the heartbeat sacrifice and the puppet’s repaired crack. Orientation is clean early; stakes are clarified by “eight more revolutions.” The causal thread—key → mechanism song → sacrifice → softened time—reads coherent within the story’s taught rules.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain from nut → blueprint → model → labyrinth insertion under a frost clock. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change: the maze reconfigures and miners are guided out. Cost exists (time pressure, physical risk), though it’s relatively light, and the miners’ arrival is a touch convenient. The hybrid causal/lyric flow stays coherent and oriented throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal stitches; the patterning of river/music/chemistry deepens to a reconfiguration where separation becomes prerequisite for reconnection. Closure lands via the release of the swans and the sent text (risk and relinquishment), with a charged final image of “divergent path that now meant home.” Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/why), and set‑ups (foam study, chrysalis) pay off. Cost is present though quiet: accepting incomplete atonement and risking rejection without confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterning of coordinates → ascent → nucleus → non‑inscription culminates in a Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible: spent moonlight, expiring parole, and the forgoing of inscription/commerce to guard emptiness. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (apples, parole, slate) pay off cleanly. A hair more friction in the mid‑path would lift the tightening from strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: touch → contagion → ricochet → pavilion cracks → demand → sacrifice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (Kilor enters the coral; Sel’s guarded breath after). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the drive lens stays coherent. Slight ambiguity about the pavilion’s “demand” is supported by physical signs (cracking, vapor), keeping cause credible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through time, resource trade, and rhythmic synchronization culminating in the “bridge of sound.” Closure lands on page with cost: the tower adapts to missing weight while the bridge endures. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). The because/therefore chain is lyrical but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from activation to corridor to amphitheater to the final custodianship stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing (“accepting custodianship, not possession”) with cost implied by self-alteration and relinquishment. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. Pressure is gentle rather than incisive, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Causal with lyric accumulation; beats link cleanly (inverted hour → threshold → cabinet’s last digit → gravity reclaims → escape). Orientation is early and crisp; the inverted gravity rule is taught and then stressed at the climax. Closure lands on page: he secures the “seeds” knowledge and exits under a live clock with visible risk. Cost is credible (risk of being locked in memory; forced triage of what he can gather).

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: the piece tightens from approach to breath‑sync to first strum to charged hush. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the valley’s silence is reweighted into “a listening, living hush,” with conceptual cost in Lark’s disciplined refusal of louder triumph. Orientation is early and steady; set‑ups (insulator, hedgehog, cracks) pay off on the page. The porcelain’s after‑glow is a crisp closure proof.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds to a closure where moral intention affects physical equilibrium and Tomas pays by renouncing ambition (queen sacrifice). The eclipse, magnetic stakes, and opponent tied to his banishment cohere causally within the story’s rules. The final reconfiguration (“Your covenant is no longer eclipsed,” smoothed stone) lands with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clean early; scope is tight and single‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build coherently from physical corrosion to psychic latch to release, each “therefore” narrowing options toward non‑violent tuning. Orientation is swift and clean (workshop, fireworks clock, locked clasp), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (tears, renunciation of the spectacle). The fuse hiss and muffled boom charge the final cadence without breaking the quiet arc. No causality slips or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: elders impose a constraint; she descends; waiting and scent‑reframing reweight the stake. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—“the seed had already sprouted inside everyone willing to breathe alongside motion.” The cost—exile to the roots, risking stench, deferral of bloom—is present if understated. Orientation is clean from the outset; linkage holds without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: inversion → navigation by water → echo chamber → spear assembly → escape and application to groves. Closure lands on-page with the orchards visibly reviving; the ticking hour imposes real constraint. The cost is mostly situational risk rather than a painful tradeoff, keeping it just shy of exceptional. Lens: Causal with lyric accents, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: investigation → clues (patches, vortices) → diagnosis (extraction) → tactic (randomized gusts) → on‑page release (thunderclap) → stabilized models. Closure reads as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (risking herself to break a convergent system; foreclosing the siphon’s return for “a thousand hours”). Orientation is crisp early, and the lens holds through the end. The price is felt more as procedural and risk than as a deep personal loss, keeping it just shy of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens through patterned acts (bells → corridor opens → heart chamber → braiding) to a charged final image. Closure lands on the page when the marble becomes an open door and the “sculpted hush” is reconfigured from prison to threshold (RR with conceptual cost). The sculptor’s poised blow functions as a live clock and is paid off in the bell-of-marble-and-dawn echo. Cost is mostly conceptual (if she fails, wonder thins), not visceral, but it’s legible at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with a causal backbone: each beat flows “therefore” (markers → flute → seam → vision → recognition → melodic shift → reweave). Closure lands on-page as a decisive reconfiguration: reality rewrites and the path home is materially altered (obsidian slivers) with the cost of confronting his own culpability. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who, where, when) and the world rule (thunder echo as key) is dramatized, not explained. The constraint (play where echoes live) shapes tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density builds (press → halo → primes → ambiguity) and pays off in a CR/RR closure where ambiguity restores stars and Dreya refuses full solution. Orientation is clean early (press at midnight; commission; vanishing‑stars window), and each beat coherently intensifies. Cost is legible on the page: “dared not finish” and the kept feathers as residual price. The final image reweights the premise without an explain‑all wrap.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean: Glassmere performance → ridgeway cave discovery → choice to leave the pendant. The causal thread (mentor’s maxims, on‑page note) motivates the decisive act and reframes the mission. Closure lands as an earned renunciation with conceptual and practical cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the note functioning as the crucial tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps build density (mist hush → frost mapping → prism flare → emotional transference) to a CR where the premise re‑prices—objects transform emotion like soil. Closure lands in the final images (wrapped prism; lantern rhythm “neither lie nor truth”) with cost (ethical peril for future handlers, duty accepted). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the causal weave is coherent within the ritual logic. The single‑scene arc tightens through the reconciliation image that alters Ilara’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence tighten as silence becomes an active conduit, culminating in a costly Earned Stasis. Orientation is clean by the second sentence (orchard/bamboo/loom, who/where/when). Closure lands on-page with cost: “the loom spinner expired” as the message sails, and the bead’s glow reframes silence’s potential. Setups (monitored winds; puzzle edges) pay off causally in tactic and result.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is tight: quake → need → descent → barter → silk → stitching → communal sacrifice → stabilized arches and vow. Closure lands with visible cost (lost memories) and a reconfigured status quo (the humming, tethered arches). The lens holds under a causal design with lyric texture and the price persists into the final image. Orientation is crisp from the outset with no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: shard → traversal → drone/hologram → revelation → decisive redirect. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he forecloses discovery to protect, with the cost legible in the final stance (“map lacunae,” taming cycles). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the lyrical mode remains legible. Minor convenience (the drone’s timely revelation) is pre‑seeded by lullaby etchings, preserving causality.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with tight causal through-lines (cairn→sea-glass→ritual placement→rekindled lamp) and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is swift and clean; the haunted dark coheres as a pressure that the sea-glass ritual answers. The final cadence (Ellis accepting his role in a quiet network, leaving a cairn for the next) lands with conceptual cost and a felt earned stasis. The magic logic stays consistent and is learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten from invitation → insertion → rotation → broadcast, culminating in a Charged Poise: Mora assumes stewardship with cost (“until another keeper takes your place”) as yesterday is consumed to mint tomorrow. Orientation is crisp from the first line; world rules are taught through action. The causal chain remains legible even in lyric mode. Closure is on‑page with a persistent constraint shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: encounters and actions layer toward a reweighted ending where Liora reprices story‑holding (remember without binding). Closure lands on the page via the titled painting and her articulated new stance, with conceptual cost (relinquishing the wing; accepting sensitivity and limits). Orientation is clean from the outset; beats link causally enough without over‑explaining. If anything, the process resolves a touch smoothly, but not so as to blunt the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each beat triggers the next: pin heard → maze freezes → dream‑constellation mapping → hidden chamber → trees quantify sorrow → restoration and release. Closure is on‑page via a decisive change and conceptual repricing: sorrow is transmuted, the labyrinth reconfigures, and Eron’s role is reweighted. The cost is present (relinquishing the old maze and custodial burden) but lightly felt. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: songs, memories, and objects layer toward a reweighting that cracks the pane. Closure lands on the page with cost (destroying the logbook, stepping through), shifting options from greenhouse stasis to open dawn. Orientation is taught early (who/where/what) and pays off when the “mirror world” reveal reframes space without breaking coherence. The final image is a CR/RR hybrid that makes a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the invitation → descent → ledger offer → vow creates a coherent tightening, with the closure as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The cost is legible: relinquishing safety to carry the ledger into daylight. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set‑ups (invitation, hiding) pay off at the end. The pattern is taught and kept without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from gardening to threshold to tea ritual to repricing the work’s meaning. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the unlocking pavilion is the key deepening that coheres the arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts ongoing, applause‑less labor as the path to “tenuous absolution.” The cost is conceptual and vocational rather than external, but it’s on‑page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean: vault → summons → test → revelation → inscription → release. Causality holds (runes indicate a void; therefore he tests; therefore he confronts the vow; therefore he measures and archives). Closure lands on the page with cost—the vow is retrieved and sealed, and the price of guilt is acknowledged and reshaped. Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp from the jetty to the trapdoor market; the sunrise deadline and hush rule provide a coherent pressure system. The decisive turn occurs when the hush is broken and Clara restores it, reconfiguring options. Closure lands with Charged Poise: she exits with the cylinder and a self‑held recording, and the vow seals cost and stance. Coincidence (Cinder’s entrance) complicates rather than resolves, fitting a Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: tastes, aurora, and election imagery build to a council decision. Causality is clean—compass leads to Lior → proposal → persuasive walk → sanctuary—yielding on‑page closure (RR/CR) with the pact and reweighted stance. The cost is conceptual (ongoing dialogue, conditions), not visceral, keeping the climax smooth. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the single scene stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece deepens through image-patterns (laughter→silence, crystal light, memory-emptying) to an on‑page RR/Earned Stasis: she remains below, the trapdoor seals, and options are reweighted with cost. Orientation is clear early and causality holds within the dream-logic taught. The decisive procedural steps (waiting, descent, memory-offloading, sketching anew) feel inevitabled. The cost—self-exile to answer the calling—is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: plate + map → tunnel journey → Archive access → seed retrieval → public planting → atmospheric shift. Orientation is firm early; the lens stays Causal through closure with a visible reconfiguration. Slight ease in city-scale remediation (mythic convenience) tempers the score but doesn’t break coherence. The closure lands on page with conceptual and social cost (public truth-telling).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: council pressure → demonstration → night fracture → diagnostic listening → hinge replacement → etching of future instructions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he preserves wonder not by mastery alone but by codifying a communal, wordless choreography with an implied price (relinquishing sole authorship; acceptance of cyclical muteness and fatigue). Orientation is strong from the first lines; the Hybrid drive (causal spine with lyric accrual) holds through the end. The cost is felt but quiet; one more beat of jeopardy during the repair would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: storm forecast → evacuation → protocol discovery → chest opened and fears threaten → miniaturize → controlled burn → dome holds. Closure lands on the page with physical action and conceptual cost (risk, rose damage, smaller but persistent fears). The drive lens is Causal and holds through to the end. Orientation is crisp from line one, and set-ups pay off without deus ex.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: circle → testimonies → deduction of Esmeralda → confession → unlocking → communal reading, with the 9 a.m. deadline tightening. Closure lands on the page via the unlocking and shared letters, with emotional cost visible in public exposure. The final image (mail truck arrives; courtyard already mended) cements a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance holds: descent → vault dance → dice authorization → defenses → upload → sabotage/flood → Vane → escape/broadcast. Orientation is clean from the opening and the closure lands on the page with cost: the lab collapses and Lira burns the bridge with her former masters while releasing the secrets. The “eternal gamble” lock and broadcast image provide a decisive before/after. Turns are earned; a few obstacles resolve a touch easily, but causality remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative lyric): coffee divination → vision → crater → coffin → retrieval, each because/therefore link clear. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (crystal wail, gravity stitching, tears) and a reconfigured future plan. Orientation is crisp from line one; the two‑shard transition is taught and paid off. Slight ease at the decisive action (lid yields quickly) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hush → ink dissolution → locating the last vowel → refolding and release. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the prophecy’s utterance and redefines power as silence carried by water, with the cost embedded in relinquishment. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity. Each beat coheres into the final image of the brook “fulfilled” like a library, a paid price and a reweighted world.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to causal turns: the meteors/lessons accrue until the seal cracks, triggering revelation, penance, and Selin’s dissolution. Orientation is crisp by the opening lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: Selin disappears and the narrator assumes duty beyond brick-reach. Setups (lies, seal, treaties) pay off in the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Causal: patterned resonance builds pressure and then causally reveals the brother’s sacrifice, culminating in Mara’s decisive acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she trades quarantine for the burden of carrying grief—made legible in the promise aloud and the garden’s path opening. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect holds without teleports. The ending image meaningfully reweights prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds: entry → writing → toll of memory → branding threat → automaton unlocked → mercy directive. Closure is on-page with cost (blood toll, risk of branding) and a decisive systemic change (imperial record altered; automaton’s directive reset). The “key with no apparent lock” is foreshadowed and pays off twice, though the final unlock skirts neatness. Orientation is clean early; stakes stay legible through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: shell → countdown → fissure → descent → negotiation → pact → reweighted surface performance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with explicit cost (“every performance would now end with memories that were none of her own”). Orientation is early and stable; the hybrid lyric-causal pattern is taught and kept. No unkept setups; the final “grateful silence” pays off the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant at the end: monks seek help → dream analysis identifies the keeper → Mara exposes denial → ritual relocation of the globe → visible release. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the glacier’s haloed myth is pierced and the keeper passes on. Orientation is clear from the outset and carried to a felt after-image (“space instead of absence”). The only limitation is that the price is largely social/spiritual and lightly dramatized beyond brief monk recoil.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The causal thread is soft but coherent (whistle → inquiry → tea‑foam insight → harbor experiment → reweighted understanding). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “The sky is changing because we are listening,” with cost encoded as collective labor, vigilance, and a relinquished night’s rest. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard flow holds.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal throughline is tight: arrival → investigation → reconstruction → discovery → ethical decision. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she burns the letters, posts a warning, and assumes stewardship, with a visible cost. Orientation is immediate and clean, and all set‑ups (diamond, rumor, audit) pay off. The corporate backstory is brisk and integrated via concrete action (reassembling letters).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal flow from reception of voices → beacon to child → arrival → broadcast → migration → training → final storm and song that “splits” the cloud. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (dawn breaches), and the price (risk of the tower shearing, months of labor, Elara’s exposed role) is legible. The piece holds an accumulative/textural lens while maintaining causal linkage, with no orientation debt. A touch more on the immediate jeopardy at the climax could heighten cost, but the turn still reads firm.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene with tight causal beats: preparation → visitors arrive → demonstration → relief → renunciation (sending the box away). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts that redemption is gleaned, not owned, and acts by releasing the charged object. Cost is legible on the page (he parts with the “finest captured note,” retaining his loneliness). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly, with a decisive cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Causal. Setups (key, lattice, marina) pay off cleanly: they build the barricade; raiders arrive; the key completes the circuit; the relic is secured. Closure lands on the page with cost (Callix’s collapse, a returned key, a reweighted stance on belief), and the final lighthouse image coheres the system. Orientation is immediate and consistent. Minor limitation: the protagonists face little risk of failure once the system engages.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the journey, measurements, and humming viaduct culminate in a resonant reconfiguration/CR where urgency is reweighted. Orientation is clean from the opening, and beats proceed causally (mapping → detours → alignments → ignition). Cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator relinquishes a defining impatience and commits to recharting with visible renunciation. The closure image (“promises stretch; borders stop”) redefines prior material without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant causal chain holds: lantern → guidance → rescue/confession → surge/lost lantern → hidden chamber → ledgers → public exposure. Orientation is crisp early; single scene with one clean uptick in stakes. Closure lands on the page with social cost: Havel’s downfall begins and Mara accepts the burden of the memories. The only softness is the convenience of the perfectly incriminating cache, but it’s seeded by the lantern’s rule-set and doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: the repair and counsel accrue toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands through the repaired heart (decisive change) and a reweighted mandate for action (conceptual repricing) with felt cost. Orientation is clean; single continuous scene holds. The price is more ethical/emotional than material, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine: the algorithm’s kaleidoscope directs the arrow tactic; metallurgy precedes miracle; the release triggers the bell’s sub‑audible ring calming the sea. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on‑page with cost (time, risk of dissolution, prior failures). The final printed verdict reweights the action into a conceptual repricing of “machines must sing.” The bell’s effect on things (not people) is a decisive reconfiguration that marks a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: numbers → Echo gate lie → patch-as-key → realization of metadata capture → restoration attempt → corporate threat → broadcast → agents arrive. Closure lands as a decisive act with cost and a conceptual repricing of “deletion” as “home.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity. A single quick leap (patch becomes key) is motivated by the visor overlay and earlier number logic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: mirror glimpse → sprint to lantern room → map to tunnels → confrontation → shard union → broadcast. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the two-shard structure (orchard to lighthouse) holds. Closure lands via a realized tactic and a conceptual reframing of “the anomaly.” The on-page cost is subdued, leaning more toward pledge and purpose than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: salvage beats and weather pressure build to the blizzard, harmonica, and the ice’s voice, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (drift‑ice marina, euthanasia tourist, three‑day wait). The cost is legible on the page (“bearing the quiet weight of postponed departure”). The throughline is cohesive without and‑then drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressures accrue through motifs (burned letter, pruning, storm) culminating in a Charged Poise acceptance with conceptual cost (apprenticeship over employment). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the rule‑set (translation of nonhuman dialogues) is taught through action. Closure lands on the page with the accepted apprenticeship and the reweighted final image (“honeyed glow now inside me”). Cost is present but conceptual rather than materially dramatized, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: quiet, ritualized steps cohere toward a charged consecration and departure. Causality is clean—clearings enable opening; parapet extends to reflect light; the ripple compresses into a burden carried. Closure arrives on the page with a felt price (to carry and not speak), and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is firm from the first lines; no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images, scent, and song thicken into a communal rearrangement that results in a charged plan (RR). Closure lands in the mural decision and the town’s quiet “yes,” with a conceptual cost of owning grief and committing labor. Orientation is clear from the outset; the beats link smoothly without outline-y “and then.” Cost is present but gentle, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Orrin refuses linear testimony and reorients the council through demonstration; the hush returns “busy” and the directive to continue reframes the world’s “final dictionary” as a false finish. Cost is present though understated: social peril and professional alienation remain live. Orientation is clean from the opening and pattern teaching (fractured sequences) pays off in the projection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (fog, driftwood, chalk, echoes) build to a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on-page: the recorder fails, prompting the turn to “marrow” listening, with the cost of forfeiting the original capture. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the stake (“instruments will forget the sky”) tightens into the construction/tuning sequence and culminates in a Charged Poise closure as the hand stops at equilibrium. The throughline is coherent and each move grows from the last, but the on‑page cost is understated—resolution arrives without a steep price or credible near‑failure. Still, the final reconfiguration (“listening to the quiet it was seeking”) lands cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the layering of mundane sounds culminates in a charged hand‑over that reconfigures the estranged relationship. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “decades of regret began to loosen,” with the felt cost of imminent death and time’s narrowing window. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each move is a motivated “therefore” within the lyric frame. The final image (“waiting to be called for the final verse”) seals the cost and cadence rather than soft‑resetting it.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a causal lens, the beats chain cleanly: Vela demands blood, Orin redirects it to the key, which triggers the corridor, which then requires shared intention to escape. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive renunciation: they return with the sarcophagus unopened, a pact formed, and a charged cost. Orientation is prompt and the single scene holds coherence. The price—risk of permanent exile and relinquished exploitation—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: map → maze → tooth test → partial alignment → descent → captive heart → final alignment with village-wide consequence. Closure lands on the page via Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (“stars locked together,” cradle creaks), with a conceptual price (skepticism yields to wonder). Orientation is swift and clean; the lens holds. Cost is more atmospheric than perilous, but it’s legible in the descent and the acceptance of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density and ritual action build to a resonant reconfiguration as the pearl forms and is released. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when) and the scene remains continuous. Closure carries cost on the page—the choice to offer the pearl—reweighting the premise via the villagers’ torchless navigation. Setups (tools, pool, vow) pay off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the garden’s patterning, resin work, and pendant reprise build to a charged poise closure. Orientation is clean early; causality (message → arrival → shared labor → plan) supports the accrual. The ending’s cost—public scrutiny approaching, emotional toll, and a quiet plan that scales against harm—feels paid-in-advance. The closure is resonant rather than decisive, but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs and cameos build toward the mirror confrontation, which reweights the premise with on‑page light/ink release. Orientation is swift and clean; the lighthouse and desk anchor early. Closure lands via a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as he declares his hope and commits to writing. Cost is present though quiet: choosing hope entails abandoning a familiar cynicism and accepting open‑ended labor.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the accumulative/textural lens holds: description → ritual → song → revival. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (wilted tendril revives; bells of sap chime) and a resonant after‑image (“new leaves rustling yes”). Cost is present but soft—more investment and vigilance than loss—yet sufficient for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual steps intensify toward sealing, and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (starlight drained, seasons of stillness implied). Orientation is crisp from the first lines (crater, orchard, starlight, Arren’s aim). Causality within the ritual is cohesive, with each step preparing the next. The closure image (measured descent, orchard whispering directions) lands decisively without needing extra exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned experiments (light/echo angles) build density toward the on‑page reanimation of time and sound. Closure lands with a felt reconfiguration (the town’s minutes layered with past voices), and the repaired timer returns to the square to alter the world. Cost is present but muted (time, attention, and a conceptual price of storing wonder). Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure (cavern → return) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated orienting of the lamp densifies pattern until the darker seam forces a reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when she measures and braids her own burden, rebalancing the grotto; the cost is her admitted lack and the near-paralysis. The who/where/when is anchored early, and causality within the lyric logic is coherent (orientation → crystals → pit → self-weave → balance). The final hush “folded…like wings” registers a resonant before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the freeze into “crystallized time” deepens the dominant stake and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: “Here and gone” is repriced into a workable ethic. Orientation is clear early (loft, rain, kettle), and the magical beat pays off causally (kettle/rain stilled; lion encounter enabling containment). The cost—choosing endurance and perpetual incompletion—is legible in the refusal to finish the lion. The ending image (chisel poised, rain as commas) cleanly seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance: because he seeks recognition, he braves the lily pads, retrieves the camera wheel, confronts the ghost, and must fill the cavity under time pressure. Closure lands on‑page with cost—he gives up curated fragments to animate the ghost’s compass and reconfigure his path. Orientation is clear early and maintained; no teleports or resets. The carousel’s restart provides a crisp cadence shift tied to the bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal spine: discovers blockage → reroutes greywater → reanimates pumps → orienting planters → recorded “equation.” Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: hope as flow × orientation ÷ distance between was and might be. Cost is present but subtle (foregoing certainty, labor, and a hand‑off to the next person), keeping it shy of a more decisive turn. Lens: Hybrid with accumulative dominance at the end holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush and water motifs builds to a cadence shift where he redefines time as interval and chooses charged poise over completion. Closure is on the page (the click, the weeping windows, the choice to leave the hand balanced and script blanks) with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the outset and there’s a single deepening turn via the mother’s lesson. The final image reweights all prior beats without needing extra mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: legend‑seeking leads to Lock Nine, salvage, sundial’s moral vector, opening the box, discovery, copying, then confrontation and committed departure. Orientation is immediate, and the final image (lock gate closing as the past “accepts its unmasking”) delivers a resonant closure with cost acknowledged. The chosen path forecloses safety and sets a new trajectory. Lens: Causal with a conceptual repricing at the end that holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: rope → storm-struck dune → fulgurite → vow forms a coherent causal sequence inside a lyric frame. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she assumes guardianship and defers sowing until the world is ready, with a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening and the set-ups pay off without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres from garden summons to charged parting, culminating in a conceptual repricing: obituary as compass. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the winter/last‑ships clock supplies ambient cost. The closure’s cost is felt—Holt takes on a binding, risky charge before roads close—though it remains quiet rather than confrontational. The beats tighten meaningfully when Selene gives the thread and when she “projects presence” away.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a Causal lens, each beat triggers the next: discovery of egg → story‑breathing → hatching → systems destabilize → decision to descend. Closure lands on the page with cost: the palace’s anchors crack and the society must abandon its engineered safety to risk soil. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the final descent reconfigures options decisively. No causality gaps or soft resets undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs and actions (coin, scar, sand, lagoon) build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the let-go of “woodsmoke lifting,” the vow, and the poured sand foreclose a self-loathing path. Orientation is clear early and the pattern taught is kept. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: breadcrumb → shard → moisture‑only thread → dry mains obstacle → geese tactic → rainfall → keyhole → release. Orientation is strong from the outset; the box’s water‑visible fail‑safe pays off precisely. Closure lands on‑page with a decisive change (fountains awaken) plus a quiet internal shift; the cost is mostly conceptual/temporal rather than sacrifice. A hairline softness: the price paid feels light relative to the city‑scale outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates via density and pattern break: contact with the Mneme Line → recognition of recursive harm → misalignment to introduce variance → charged farewell image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the before/after is legible in the bent motifs and new alphabets, with the conceptual cost acknowledged. Orientation is clean early, and all set‑ups (gear, sonar, vow) pay off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images (butterflies/ribbon/poems) intensify until the cadence shift at “Listen to the ribbon,” yielding the design turn. Closure lands on the page with cost (three nights’ carving, anonymous memorial, communal unveiling) and a resonant final line. Orientation is clean from the outset (shed behind cemetery, greenhouse). The weeks‑long montage stays coherent and feeds the ending rather than diffusing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated tactile acts and images densify toward a cadence shift (the lie confessed, time “inhaling,” unified bells). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—he gives up the protective lie and reweights his stewardship of time. Orientation is clean from line one (who/where/when), and the constraint (paused pendulum) frames the window. Each step coheres causally enough within the lyric mode to avoid soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the chain is coherent: find → align → decode → follow map → exhume → re-house regret. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when Milo returns the king and letter through the sovereign case, reweighting Rowan and the hush. The cost is modest (a night’s endurance and psychic strain) but on-page and thematically apt. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Waiting → data chain to potential coup → constraint choice → writing → on‑page consequence (water‑mill caravan) → charged poise at the end. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she seeds change and accepts expanding ignorance as price, poised for the next attempt. Cost is legible but intellectual; still, the because/therefore chain is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten cleanly: find glow → decode lyric → locate antenna → organize static → signal threatened → cloak in city noise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: decentralizing the broadcast into “every cough, footstep,” with a clear before/after. Cost is legible (risk of regime, loss of a single locus of transmission, personal depletion), though not dramatized as harm. Orientation is crisp by line 2–3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: image density and motif cadence build to a Charged Poise closure—he refuses to wear the mask and leaves it to “watch itself.” Orientation is crisp from the outset (Vanishing Point Gallery, night, chair, skylight). The cost is legible on the page in the final beats (he cannot watch; departure as forfeiture of solace/control). Setups (mentor’s warning, mirage of safety) pay off in the mask’s suspended, threatening comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: cog → ascent → debate → descent through sediment → cog in sextant → star chart → joint decision as custodians. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he reframes “story vs data” into verifiable narrative and accepts co‑custodianship. Minor neatness in the cog fitting a corroded socket flirts with convenience but doesn’t undercut the earned payoff. Orientation is crisp and maintained across the two‑shard structure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through patterned silence and communal practice; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration when the chord clarifies grief and reweights power. Orientation is clean from the first line; the rosette and alcove train the pattern early. Cost is present (spent grant, reputational risk, confronting authority, then leaving what she catalyzed), if gently rendered. The final image reconfigures the city/library’s function without a mechanical tie‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions build toward the comet’s zenith where the seed opens, then the communal serving reconfigures meaning. Closure lands with cost (she forgoes private omniscience, leaves the tool behind) and a clear before/after in the village’s stance. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and every step pays forward to the ending image. The live clock (alignment) cleanly tightens the window.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal throughline: approach tower → riddle → descent → box → alarm → compelled truthful reveal → reboot. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (city relit) and a conceptual reweighting via ritual truth. The cost is present (alarms, the tower’s refusal without a spoken truth), though it’s modest and swiftly resolved. Orientation is immediate and stable; the Causal lens holds start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who, where, when), and the pattern of object placement teaches its rules cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the house “not lonely but mute,” and “Displacement…illness, placement the cure,” with the room’s warmth and door’s repose as on‑page consequence. Cost is subtle (risking the hush’s warning and ceding agency to the house), but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance holds: image density and motifs tighten into a method (threaded leak) that reweights stakes. Causality tracks cleanly from ampoule arrival → discovery of erased peers → revised tactic (drip, not shatter) → revival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: certainty reconceived as porous, with the garden’s final image bearing cost (history of erasure, acceptance of risk). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), with one coherent transition to the sealed courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of rolls/proofs builds until the compromise question breaks the cadence. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: they erase sums, place the dice, stop ascending; the staircase reconfigures into a landing. Cost is explicit—foreclosing the loop and living beside regret—and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is clear from the outset (infinite staircase, two characters, one scene).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern intensifies from watering to luminescent script to city-wide soft reversals, then resolves with brush dimming and earned stasis. Closure lands with cost: the brush’s finite power and his exhaustion foreclose continuation tonight, reweighting the promise of “another chapter.” Orientation is clean and the magical logic is taught through action. The page-to-city diffusion is a held pattern that reshapes stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dread → unveiling → communal mobilization → charged festival. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city shifts from paralysis to action, with a felt cost in risk, resource strain, and the promise to re‑conceal power. Orientation is strong from the outset (waterfall grotto, guide, apprentices), and beats link coherently. Cost is quieter than maximal but palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance holds: yoyo → synchronized clocks → opened panel → descent → engineered resonance → acceptance. Closure lands on the page with cost (yoyo’s sacrifice, foreclosed grandiose futures, loneliness) and a reconfigured world (clocks stilled, tide holding its breath). Orientation is crisp within ~120 words; the single transition to the cavern is clean. No teleports or late rule changes; setups pay off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: resuscitation → funhouse entry → mirror confession → predictive photos → coffin confrontation → naming exchange → capture. The closure is decisive: fear collapses into a thumbnail, lights die, advisor dissolves, Eli’s heart holds steady. Cost is on‑page (breastplate bursts, luminance sealed, clasp absent), and the final image reconfigures options. Orientation is strong from the outset and supports the end.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: pressure compounds (chains → storm), and closure lands in a dawn hush that reconfigures stakes into ongoing practice. Decisive changes occur (liberating the orchard; storm retuned), and cost is legible (cracking driftwood, salted blossoms, fatigue implied). Orientation is clear from the first lines; causality remains intact within the lyric frame. The cost is felt but modest, keeping this short of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance: balcony → descent → watchers → mirror dialogue → whistle‑note → coordinates → chosen descent. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a decisive commitment with cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; set‑ups (pattern language, whistle, sextant, watchers) pay off. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: petal signal → access → mural/letter parallel → hidden chest → ledger → caretaker standoff → parable persuasion → leak. Closure lands on‑page via the decision to expose and the images sent, with risk marked by illegality and sirens. The lens reads Hybrid (Causal/Situational) and holds through the end. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/forward‑leaning rather than immediately punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density and patterning (notes/dowels, interlaced absence) build to a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean early; the low‑tide window and drawbridge clock provide coherent constraint. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: he embeds both his notes and the discovered handbill, reweighting his mission with generational continuity at a time cost under rising water. Stakes and tactics link smoothly, no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is tight: blackout → disorientation → readjusted spine reveals passage → codex test → flood triggered by pedestal removal → pressured verdict via stamp → escape with sealed loss. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when). Closure lands as a decisive act with cost: she cannot return, the passage is sealed, but the condemned codex survives to challenge the official record. The drive lens reads Causal and holds through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality holds via patterned intensification: workshop → basilica acquisition → charged release in the tea garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she chooses release that risks shattering and then accepts sorrow’s permanence—with cost legible in the cracked globe and communal grief inhalation. Orientation is clear early and the “descending while ascending” pattern is taught and reprised. No teleports or soft resets; price and stakes pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: blast → geode survival → observatory calibration → node confrontation → geode sacrifice. Closure lands on‑page with cost (relinquishing the bride‑charged crystal) and reconfigures stakes from catastrophic flip to redistributed potential. Orientation is swift and steady; the observatory and skiff ground the middle. The ending’s charged poise (saved vs. delayed war) holds without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (observatory at dusk, Nero, the pilgrim), and the causal chain is clean: chip → telescope alignment → star‑trail mapping → sound/names → opening → drone entry → repriced ending. The drive lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative/lyric bias, held through closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: belonging reframed as frequency, with the drained power and relinquished isolation as cost. No major teleports or soft resets; each beat tightens knowledge or access.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, image chains build toward a decisive shift: watch hand → driftwood corridor → ledger revelation → spoken name → renunciation. Closure lands on the page with cost (a resolved vow and a charged final image of the fused carving). Magical turns (self‑arranging figurines, the kelp‑bound ledger) read as motivated by the established pattern rather than convenience. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and remains coherent through the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritualized exchange tightens through pattern (moon, neutrality, object) toward a charged poise closure. The decisive reconfiguration occurs when Mara threads the silver through the pull, accepting ongoing weight; the cost is a chosen burden and risk embraced earlier by untethering Ilren. Orientation is immediate and stable; causal links are quiet but coherent. The moon-phase ritual and neutrality rule persist as constraints shaping each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: decision to launch → storm/utility‑pole method tested → lightning and hallucinations → recommitment → arrival/pledge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “You steer; I will mind the stars” reframes the navigation rule‑set with cost acknowledged. Orientation is crisp from the ramp to the dock, and the scene stays contiguous with one tightening turn at the lightning strike. The faulty compass and poles persistently constrain options and shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Causal lens, beats link cleanly: procedure → descent via newspapers → lake visions → chosen path → surface headline. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and Charged Poise: committing to coach and walking toward the diamonds with tomorrow’s paper. Cost is present (foreclosing profit, accepting accountability and risk of relapse), if somewhat idealized by the lake’s aid. Orientation is crisp from the opening and patterning (newspapers, baseball) pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: spices → beasts’ sigil → fortune meld → urn crack → apparition → choice to halve the magic → new stasis. Closure lands on-page with cost: she surrenders full humanity, and the orchard’s cycle rekeys to their shared pulse. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no teleporting props or patches. The persistent constraint (metamorphosis already tugging her bones) shapes the pivotal choice and the final state.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Causal. The ritual sequence links cleanly—travel to the glade, offer/barter, cards spiral, the hourglass appears, the cost is named, she pays it, the father rises—culminating in a Decisive Change with felt cost. Closure is on the page and legible; the exact cost is the lost memories carried on the saucer, echoed by the inkless hand-tracing. The external voice guides but does not resolve; her agency and payment unlock the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: patterned ritual escalates to the frost gate resisting until a final inner renunciation triggers passage. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causal joins (tear at gate → refracted silhouettes → self‑forgiveness → opening) read precise. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost and reweighted options. No teleports or dangling set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jars to spiral to constellation, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as he releases the final light and is reweighted. Orientation is clear early (black sand beach, volcano, night). Cost is on‑page (relinquishing the collection; choosing to stay despite risk), and the final image coheres with the premise. The prophecy pattern folds back into closure without breaking causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: blackout → initial plan → complication (locks asleep) → inventive reframe using sundial geometry → execution → locks open. Orientation is strong from the ramparts to the sundial chamber, with one scene sustained. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (spent resource, treasonous act) and a reweighted world (doors unlatched, fort “lighter”). Cost is more implied than dramatized, preventing a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats stack cleanly: arrival under aurora → stone sequences → star dust activation → revelation → final stone → eel bargain → friction returns. Orientation is strong early, and closure lands on the page with a decisive change (friction restored, curse reconfigured). Cost is more conceptual/emotional than punishing, but the risk of “snarling” future and the covenant weight provide sufficient pressure. No causality breaks; the pattern teaching pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The timer cadence, dictation, and the envelope discovery densify pressure until the stance shift—writing “with ink that refused erasure” and carrying the map—forecloses seeking permission. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the vigil’s end (“because he could listen”) pays off the pattern. Cost is legible in the risked defiance and chosen burden of the map.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece teaches and sustains a Hybrid drive (accumulative texture of the duel’s forms with causal beats: sundial light → overture bars → portal). Closure lands on-page with cost when they choose to share authorship and step through, leaving the atrium’s order behind. Setups (sundial codes, needle card, the overture’s condition) pay off cleanly. The magical causality is consistent, though the risk of failure remains more aesthetic than dire.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: details and communal pressure accrue toward a Charged Poise/RR ending as the library brightens and the town gathers. Orientation is clear early; stakes crystallize in the rooftop call and the arrival of exiled citizens. The cost is mostly implied (risk of arrest; parole jeopardy), not paid on-page, softening impact. The final slip “Tomorrow we molt together” reweights the premise without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure holds beautifully under an Accumulative/Textural lens: archive descent → arbor initiation → public performance forms a coherent, deepening sequence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: trains delay, the crowd breathes as one, fate “missed its departing train,” and Clarion recommits to play “until the horizon invites night.” Cost is legible in his refusal to mend time, risking schedules and embracing an unresolved longing. Orientation is clean from the outset (station pianist at dusk), and set‑ups (clock, compasses, projector) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned waypoints (dream → verification) tighten into the dawn listening, then the seed’s emergence, then the eastward sign and departure plan. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: carving a mast and committing to sail before monsoon with the seedling as “captain, logbook, and compass.” Cost is legible—risking the voyage and leaving the ridge’s protections under a live clock. Causality reads coherent within the magical logic; no dangling set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: clip → compass tug → lace map → stair → cavern → color → diffusion → altered memory state. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the causal ritual logic holds without arbitrary rule drops. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: they face severed memories, which settle into the bonsai as rings. The ending’s quiet stasis reads earned and coherent with the lens.

The narrative logic is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight and the single-scene structure is effective, with a clear DC/RR closure. However, the plot relies on two key conveniences that weaken its integrity. The discovery of a hidden recorder inside the arrowhead for the second lock feels like a late-breaking solution not previously established. Similarly, snapping an iron chain link with "corded sinew" strains credulity, momentarily breaking the otherwise grounded sequence of actions.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The structure is flawless for its length, with a single continuous scene that builds pressure through ritual action rather than external opposition. The closure, where the sundial's needle lands on 'Gardener,' provides a decisive, on-page reconfiguration of the story’s core rules with a clear conceptual cost: the redistribution of his stored-up "luck."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.7)
    The Causal drive lens is executed with flawless precision, linking motivation to action, consequence, and a necessary reversal. Closure is masterful, landing as both a Decisive Change (securing the proof) and a Resonant Reconfiguration of her ethics, with the cost made tangible in the final image ("forever aware of her fingerprints").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.4)
    Operating under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot progresses through symbolic stages rather than simple causality, building thematic weight. The structure is elegant, moving from a subterranean hunt to a transformative underworld and finally to a liminal river journey.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with masterful control.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building atmosphere and sensory detail toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration.

The final image of the sapling's note promising more music provides a perfect, charged cadence that reweights the initial "chronic hush" without erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless causal structure within its single scene. The progression from consultation to transaction to result is logical and builds with quiet tension. The closure, a Decisive Change for Celine and a Resonant Reconfiguration for the narrator, is achieved on the page with a clearly stated cost ("memory fog"). The final image of distant thunder acts as a perfect moment of Charged Poise, resonating with the story's themes and hinting at the narrator's ongoing cycle of work.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story's primary flaw is a severe scope violation; it compresses weeks of events, multiple locations, and a large cast into a single-scene word count. This forces a reliance on summary ("they compared shipping ledgers") and a chain of convenient coincidences (Liora's cousin, the stevedore's memory, the violinist's appearance) instead of dramatized, causal progression. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands thematically but feels unearned due to the weak, episodic structure that violates the "two shards" limit.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural drive. The narrative builds pressure through a crescendo of resonant images rather than causal turns, culminating in a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where the plot advances through layers of insight rather than external events.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Causality flows from sensory experience and memory, leading to a perfectly pitched climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with conceptual weight; the protagonist's state is unchanged, but its meaning is irrevocably deepened. The cost—returning to invisibility—is made tangible against the brief, triumphant moment of being seen.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, where sensory details and internal changes build pressure toward the final reconfiguration.

The closure is a powerful combination of a Conceptual Repricing for Mara and a Decisive Change for Arden, landing with a clear, felt cost—the renunciation of the pearl. Causality is impeccable, with each discovery and reaction flowing logically from the enchanted environment and the characters' established natures.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building a state of muted grief before methodically reconfiguring it. The structure is elegant: arrival, presentation, demonstration, and coda. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing, where the end of exile is redefined not as an event but as an ongoing, phantom-like process of recovery, with the cost being the acceptance of imperfection. The lens holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clear, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. Orientation is established immediately. The plot progresses through a series of surreal but consistent causal steps: arrows lead to the door, the punch creates the rail, the choice leads to the fortress. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where Elara's exchange with the fortress reweights her entire worldview, with the cost being her admission of vulnerability. The "after" state is made tangible by the inverted arrows guiding her home.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly within a single, continuous scene. Orientation is immediate and strong. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Soraya's internal framework is rebuilt with a felt cost—the loss of her simpler, guarded worldview. The final action of leaving the journal makes this internal change concrete and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story presents a strong causal chain under a Causal lens, and the closure is decisive. However, its structure is a significant flaw; it reads as a compressed summary of a longer narrative rather than a focused scene or two-shard story.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong and the closure lands with a clear, felt cost under a Causal lens. However, the resolution of the climax hinges on a soft deus ex machina: tripwires retracting after she "synced her biometrics to the beacon's rescue protocol." This introduces a convenient, late-game rule that slightly undermines the tension of her skillful maneuvering.
