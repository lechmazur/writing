  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational inflection at closure. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory resonance, memory fragments, and the ledger's gradual revelation, culminating in a Charged Poise where the protagonist steps toward confrontation with visible cost (leaving the ruined furnace behind, accepting the hunt). The "ghost ink brightening" and arrows provide a tightening that narrows options. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~100 words. One slip: the canyon's "breathing" and "echo" mechanisms are impressionistic and not fully causal, but the closure effect remains legible and the cost—stepping into danger with calm resolve—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images of silence, memory fragments, and the heat-mapping system until the final vision of architecture-as-orchestra reconfigures the opening bewilderment into purposeful endurance. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Lio's body becomes "the first instrument," a renunciation of hearing in favor of felt vibration with the cost legible in "wrecked and waterlogged." Orientation anchors clearly by line 60 (conservatory, post-capsize, tuning forks). One small gap: the transition from individual grief profiles to city-wide deployment compresses quickly; one additional tightening beat showing a tactical constraint would firm the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first ~100 words (undertaker, harbor town, dusk). The piece accumulates through matched images (burying generations → shelving lives; surface lens → depth lens) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias recognizes his surface work mirrors the library's depth work, accepting the task with visible cost ("stepped between breaths and spines"). However, the final beat compresses the shelving action into summary ("The task was not to heal... but to shelve them properly") rather than dramatizing one specific act of placement, which dulls closure sharpness and caps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory pressure (wind, tiles, bell) and social fragments (anonymous donors) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's declaration reweights the covenant without naming names. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of "future assembling itself" crystallizes options with undeniable pressure and felt cost (secrecy ends, vulnerability begins). One meaningful deepening when Kito's revelation reframes the storeroom mystery. Cost is conceptual and social—exposure of the fragile system—legible in Mara's promise to "mark what we owe one another."

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece gathers density through image-layering (mist, lanterns, sparks) and reaches closure when Arun exhales a lantern that hovers between him and the boy—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost visible in the release. The camera experiment provides causal linkage (crystal → corridor → recognition → boy encounter → shared breath). Orientation anchors (twilight viaduct, Arun, camera box) appear early. One meaningful deepening: the realization that unused love lives in the breath-pause, which directly enables the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates density through layered images (halo fragment, photographs, hyperbolic geometry) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (dissolution as diffusion into the lattice). However, the cost remains conceptual and abstract—"outline fray" and "histories smeared" lack a concrete forfeiture or visible price that would make the before/after legible with felt weight. The closure image is poetic but does not reweight prior material decisively enough to satisfy the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara guides the Overseer's hands away from ruin with visible cost (her voice soft, her position chained, the vault's survival dependent on sustained deception). The causal lens holds—her prior observation of his key-handling hierarchy enables the final deflection. Orientation anchors cleanly (carnival center, chained stool, Overseer pacing, distant detonations). One meaningful tightening occurs when the keys spill and she decodes his sequence, narrowing her tactical window and raising the cost of error.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (sunken greenhouse, solo diver, device designer) establish by the opening paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred: pressure deepens through layered absences ("silence where crew once cursed") and converges at the forge scene where the prototype "trembles, then releases a sound thin as a hairline fracture." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the dual-betrayal insight reweights all prior material, and the final lacquer-over-crack metaphor lands with conceptual cost (acceptance of continuous repair). One micro turn (hearing two overlapping breaks) tightens the dominant stake without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the second paragraph. The piece reads as accumulative/textural: the protagonist collects faces, follows coded flowers, meets the stranger, opens the jar, and sees layered portraits—but escalation is largely additive rather than a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The closure image (jar now brimming with reflections, uncertainty about theft direction) offers conceptual repricing, yet the cost remains oblique; the line "unsure whether I had stolen or been stolen" asserts ambiguity without dramatizing a foreclosed path or felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is legible within ~120 words (abandoned control room, glassblower, cold morning). The piece accumulates through motif reprise (ice, heart, control/invitation) and cadence shift; the final image—vessel on console, invitation to return—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the protagonist's cautious heart shifts, options crystallize. One meaningful deepening occurs when Corin explains the shift from targeting lenses to vessels that "cradle questions." Closure is on the page, cost is felt, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a Causal-Situational Hybrid lens: the burned file and cast list force the library wait, the boy's arrival and cipher provide the method, and the final decision to confront the studio lands as Charged Poise—options crystallized, cost undeniable but not yet paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the pattern on the cast and rewrites her own purpose. The cost is felt (walking in shaking, risking further erasure) but not fully dramatized in consequence, which keeps this in the 7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric density, silence as material) and accumulates pressure through the star's dimming, the storm's approach, and the map's gradual completion. Closure arrives on-page as Charged Poise: the finished map offers "passages through the chambers of fear, memory, and patience," reconfiguring the endless night into navigable grammar. Cost is conceptual and felt—the captain must "learn its quiet grammar" and "refuse" familiar modes of navigation—though the final image could make the price more viscerally legible. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs (ridge fort, oracle arrival, storm context).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The loops teach a pattern of density increase (feather frost, tremble in voice, crack in statue's neck) that reweights HEPA-3's understanding of thought as "a place where different kinds of seeing could meet." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): his answer that thoughts "come from the space between moments" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost—he can no longer return to scheduled diagnostics. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the 612th touch releasing the aerial view) narrows his processing from status screens to doubled perception. Cost is legible: the violin melts, loops stutter and fail, and his operational model is permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, image recurrence) and sustains it. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the registrar's silence becomes legible intention, crystallizing options with felt cost—years of flattened selfhood cracking. Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (registrar, archive hall, post-language city). The lens holds; cost is visible in "mistrust cracked like thin ice."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated motifs (marbles, luck metrics, blooming/withering) and the final image reweights the opening question about measured luck. Orientation is clean by line three. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the maze answering him, "blooming and withering in time with his slowing pulse") with conceptual cost legible in the merging of gardener and garden, though the final beat lacks a sharp decisive moment that forecloses an option with visible friction. The lens holds, but the ending drifts into lyricism without a last tightening that makes the cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a Hybrid lens that resolves under Accumulative/Textural closure: the prism hums, the embryos stabilize, and Ilen's micro-adjustment reweights the premise of sideways time with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ilen wraps his hand around the lever and nudges it, causing the neural spark to drift sideways—a small but decisive reconfiguration. The cost is felt in the valley's hush and the tremor along his bones, though it remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with density building through water imagery and musical notation discoveries. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the musician bows and raises his instrument, crystallizing his acceptance of the ghost's rebellion with the cost felt in "wordless conversation they would play together." The tightening occurs through progressive revelation of the hidden score's subversive nature, reweighting the dominant stake from curiosity to complicity. One meaningful deepening is present and legible under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (ridge station, post-fever, Mara and oracle alone). The dominant stake—whether to acknowledge and act on the suppressed storm-steering hypothesis—is signaled by "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" and escalates through remembered fever confession, oracle's retrieval, and Mara's final acceptance of the burden. Closure is Charged Poise: Mara's "the weight is mine to carry" crystallizes her stance and forecloses the path of continued denial with felt cost (isolation, responsibility). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative coloring (the recurring Feverwhisper image and auroral sorrow pulse through to charge the ending). One minor slip: the phrase "something in her had smudged the neat narrative" is slightly abstract where a concrete recalled moment would sharpen causality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (narrator, Evan), where (tunnel mouth then interior), and when (night, post-confession) within the first ~100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images—rosary beads on the valve, phantom footfalls, the drip and metallic rhythm—that reweight Evan's guilt and the narrator's complicity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the truth "has finally found a place to rest that is not just his alone"), a measured deepening rather than a decisive physical turn. The cost is felt but oblique: Evan's whispered names and the narrator's shift from dismissal to cataloguing evidence mark a relational and emotional price. One deduction: the causal link between the radio psychics' "patterns" and this specific tunnel location feels slightly underbuilt on the page, though it does not break the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (dripping stone, roots turning pages) and maintains it through transformation sequences; the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the keeper remains at the refuge while the library surfaces, reweighting the witnessing duty. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the swan summons him and he steps onto blank pages that draft futures. Cost is legible in the final image: he abandons the vantage of neutrality and remains separate from the surfacing knowledge, a visible forfeiture of reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (sage, pine, dimming light) and the eclipse as shared event, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the curl's return reweights Mara's grief without reversing it). Orientation anchors early (Sage Ridge rehab, sunrise routine, eclipse morning). The cost is visible: Mara's memory "did not lance but open," a felt shift that forecloses her old avoidance. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the closure image (the ring of fire mirroring the curl) lands with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (non-human historian, silo library, post-human era) and maintains accumulative pressure as Brann moves from burned diary to tapestry, each artifact deepening the thematic question. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered historical echoes until the final realization that "the walls of every age had been rehearsing the same question." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Brann's stance crystallizes ("the old ones were enough work") with the conceptual cost of accepting an endless archive without new voices. The cost is legible but operates more as conceptual acceptance than visible forfeiture, keeping the score just below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a causal lens with motivational coherence: prophecies accumulate, Parker's arrival complicates, narrator climbs lighthouse and rewrites the signal. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the narrator accepts complicity and will "listen to the sea read back my fortunes," foreclosing the innocent bystander path with visible cost. Orientation anchors are present (island bar, after last orders, lighthouse). However, the climactic rewrite of the outgoing sequence is narrated with compression that slightly obscures the mechanics of how the reversal happens and what immediate cost lands on the page; the final image's cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: Jonas's rhetorical questions narrow the demon's logical ground (causal pressure) within the situational frame of the exorcism ritual. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (abandoned chapel, dusk, Father Jonas, possessed girl). The closure is a clean Decisive Change—the demon "slipped free"—with visible cost in the form of Jonas's extended rhetorical labor and the girl's passive endurance. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jonas paints the ultramarine lines and begins his homily, escalating from ambient sound to direct logical confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and sustains one continuous scene in the glass spire. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (nautilus, mirrored horizon, timeline mapping) and the final baton-lift attempts a cadence shift. However, closure as Charged Poise is undercut—the "waiting for the unheard symphony to rise" lacks legible cost or foreclosed option; it's an aspirational tableau rather than a reconfiguration with pressure. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Eli sacrifices or risks in that final beat, only hopeful posture.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear conceptual lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) by the tablet introduction and holds it through the corridor maze to the final image. Orientation is prompt (viaduct, Lio, post-rain) within the first 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (release of the tablet after retracing past selves) with visible cost: gravity returns incrementally, the maze simplifies, and he surrenders the map. The maze sequence, however, summarizes key turns ("he stepped into the first room… listening instead of performing") rather than dramatizing even one full choice with friction, which weakens the felt texture of the closure's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory detail, the filament installation, and the children's progressive contact with the drums until the final beat ("silence finally became music again") reconfigures the central stake. Orientation anchors (drum cavern, Eira, students) arrive early. Closure lands on the page with visible cost—tears, sobs, the thinning of numbness—and the backward-recorded mechanism shapes tactics throughout. One micro turn (the boy Jorin's sob) deepens pressure before the group follows. The ending reconfigures via pattern accumulation rather than a single causal pivot, which fits the inferred lens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors (storm recorder, courtyard, post-curfew) land by line 3. The closure effect reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator crystallizes a new role (record pigeon flights, not for ministry but for senders) with felt cost (professional betrayal, solitude weaponized). Causality is clean under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the tube discovery, perimeter check, decoded message, pigeon observation, and final alignment—with one meaningful deepening when "Simply listen upwind" reweights prior observation into active complicity. Cost is legible in "alone but aligned," foreclosing neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: protagonist, coastal highway, grotto, poet present by ~15% mark. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (energy beings, rope, dust patterns, unrolling life) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the end where the narrator recognizes choices as texture-expanding rather than good/evil binary. Cost is implied (lover, job, scholarship all at stake) but the final beat does not show a foreclosed path on the page—only recognition. The ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure but stops short of a visible action or forfeiture, landing it as RR (Charged Poise) with felt rather than paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: pressure accrues through layered imagery (chronic hush, drowned cathedral, diving suits, pumps that refuse closure) until the final beat reconfigures the mendicant's bowl from asking to listening—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) with clear conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (harbor city, porthole balcony, sunken greenhouse) land cleanly by ~15% of text. The rainforest backstory occupies ~18% but primes the unfinished-beauty motif that charges closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara's invitation shifts Elio from public performance to private collaboration, narrowing his options toward the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (Eve, auditor role, amber grotto, dusk, unreliable feelings). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory details and motifs (static, copper, amber, blotter petal), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eve's static sense "arranged itself, assembling patterns the way constellations emerge from scattered stars." Closure lands with conceptual cost: "my certainties will be subsumed into questions" and "you may not like the person who walks back out." One meaningful deepening occurs when the ampoule is pressed into her palm and borrowed feelings thread through her nerves, reweighting her relationship to half-truths from enemies to scaffolds. The cost is felt on the page in her acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers reflection, the letter's detour, collaborative reshelving, and converges on a plan to host readings; the final image ("this chance friendship might reshape what his harbor valued") reweights Elias's profit-led world with a conceptual cost (commerce versus compassion). Orientation anchors cleanly (Elias, library, post-concert hour). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias describes his scheme and Marin accepts, crystallizing the stakes. Minor causality softness: the leap from letter delivery to full-scale weekly program feels compressed, and Marin's instant agreement elides friction that would test the stakes more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elian, orchard, post-impact timeframe) arrive within the first three paragraphs; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through the shared search, discovery of Siltghost's tag, and Mira's directive, culminating in Elian's sculpture decision as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: crystallized commitment with felt cost in the final image). The two-day structure with clear transitions holds coherence. Cost is visible: Elian moves from "solitary ditches" to communal making, foreclosing his former isolation. Small deduction: the obsidian arbor's appearance feels slightly convenience-timed rather than set up earlier, nudging causality but not breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (illustrator, rooftop canals, dusk, commission to find echoes) land within the first 100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the pendant's interrupted cadence recurs and intensifies, the hum guides movement, time-sculpting deepens, and the final choice to sketch "the absence" instead of caging an echo reweights the premise with visible cost (forfeiting the commission's literal goal). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist redefines the task from capture to release, and the cost is legible in "I brought back drawings, not chains"—a renunciation that forecloses the original path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of the missing space) with visible cost: Corren relinquishes retrieval and commits to a teaching future that honors loss. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered description and the shift from pleading to acceptance reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Corren, cavern orchard, night). One turn (the shift from retrieval to acceptance) tightens options with felt opportunity cost, satisfying the one-meaningful-deepening threshold for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout: sense-memory fragments accumulate pressure that deepens into the librarian's collapse and Marrow's realization. Orientation anchors (shadowed library, dawn, outage, Marrow in crawl space) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marrow's invisible interventions crystallize into a method with felt cost—he remains unseen but present through others' senses—and the final image reweights his opening wish. One cost-proof slip: the conceptual price (永久 invisibility accepted) is legible but not viscerally dramatized in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece layers observations and reflections that deepen Mara's resistance to change, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where she realizes "every hour she had spent among seedlings...had been teaching her how to reconstruct herself...by releasing control." Cost is felt: her knees give, fear tastes like iron, and the nursery sounds fall away—she loses the boundaries she has maintained. Orientation anchors early (valley, nursery, dawn, Mara). One meaningful deepening occurs when the pocketed leaf heats and triggers the climactic perception shift. The closure reweights all prior material—her detours, the wounded linden, her parents' loss—under the lens of involuntary growth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—details accrue (failed tide, amber insect, rain trails) and compress into the checkpoint exchange, a Charged Poise moment where Mara steps onto the slick road with packed canvases, offering the brooch instead of papers. Orientation anchors arrive early (tidal island, post-water-wars, insomniac painter). The closure reconfigures her status from island observer to active trader, the brooch becoming currency between worlds; cost is legible in her departure and the guard's recognition of "an exchange of hungers." One hairline slip: the phrase "an overdue appointment, an exchange of hungers between worlds that had pretended to be separate" leans slightly abstract where a sharper image would lock the RR tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: pilgrim Mira arrives at the musical crystal cave where Lyra waits. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through the cave's escalating unpredictability and the pearl's swirling visions rather than causal links. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (both women reweighted by the unseen forces) with conceptual cost visible in Lyra's role shift from seer to witness. The cost reads more contemplative than felt; no concrete foreclosure of a prior plan appears on the page, keeping this shy of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and sustains a single continuous scene on the harbor. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara's walking, listening, and fragment-gathering intensify through "staggered intervals" until the crowd assembles and Caven's tremulous note reweights the absence-as-music motif with palpable cost (his uncertainty, the city's unfulfilled hope). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the question-like note crystallizes options without resolving them, and the cost—exile's lasting scar, communal silence—is felt on the page. One causal hairline: the crowd's arrival feels more summoned by narrative necessity than by traceable on-page causality, though the misted light and Mara's placement of the valve provide some spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated mapping imagery and the punch motif. Orientation anchors arrive early (Adrian, kitchen table, midnight hour). The closure crystallizes as Charged Poise: the conductor's challenge to "map the way back from silence" reconfigures Adrian's professional skill into a moral task, and his standing at the threshold with the punch carries conceptual cost—accepting responsibility for charting what others avoided. The cost is felt but not yet paid on the page, satisfying RR requirements. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrows lead to the shadow-doorway, narrowing his options to cross or abandon the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece builds through layered memory fragments, deepening Lio's stance from rigid skepticism to "spacious enough to hold wonder." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—"my doubt had grown spacious enough to hold wonder without breaking"—reweights the opening stake with felt cost (the surrender of certainty). Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One deduction: the middle third occasionally loops conceptually (grandmother's kindness restated multiple times) without adding new pressure, creating minor drift before the transcription sequence tightens focus.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with the solar storm intensifying density and the fragment's revelation serving as a pattern-break that reweights the goodbye-stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the protagonist begins redrawing boundaries, crystallizing intent with felt cost (untying from immortality). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The because/therefore chain (storm → magnetic alignment → fragment activation → spatial revelation) holds across the piece, and the final image makes the protagonist's shift in stance legible with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the narrator rewrites the equation, redirecting half the funds to refugee aid while securing asylum, a "living imbalance that favors the broken." Drive lens reads Causal with an accumulative undertow (the lattice of thefts structures the choice). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the cylinder → decoding → final split. Cost is legible in the breach itself and its moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual detail (time, hum-line, story) and deepens through the shift from named histories (Mrs. Ibarra, the boy) to dates-and-names-that-do-not-exist, then to the lamp's extinction and Aurelio's wait—a Charged Poise that crystallizes his stance (offering fragile stories, imagining the town's rearrangement) with felt cost (the unfinished ripple, no answering sound). Orientation anchors early (mountaintop, empty town, dawn). One meaningful deepening is clear: the progression from specific invented pasts to pure index to silent vigil reweights the dominant stake. The cost is conceptual and relational (the town remains silent; he carries his quiet archive homeward), legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—layering sound over sight, rumor over rust—and maintains coherence through accretion of sensory fragments. Orientation anchors (port city, narrow room above customs office, container maze) appear within the first third. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): writing a new certificate with "pending" death date and blank name line, accepting unfinishedness as a deliberate stance. Cost is felt—he lets go of retrieval and commits to dispersal—but the final image could charge harder; the poison label reprise and pencil detail provide texture without a sharp reweighting of prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered memory vignettes and humming resonances until the final image reweights the myth as "permission to keep asking." Orientation anchors (Tamsin, observatory, "tonight") land early. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she walks away following her "unanswered compass," accepting the shape of absence rather than filling it—visible cost in the renunciation of neat answers. One persistent constraint (the ephemeral compass as shifting memory-map) shapes her final stance. The lens holds cleanly; causality operates through resonance and pattern-break rather than because/therefore, which is appropriate for the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Jae feeds data to Lilo, who encodes warnings in murals, which enables Carnies to migrate and form co-ops before buyouts. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Lilo's serpent mural poses the final question with undeniable pressure, and the cost is felt in Jae's realization that they may only be "buying time." The reversal—from naive belief in a "middle passage" to recognizing the walls are closing—narrows options. One deduction: the escalation occurs more through summary ("those months," "slowly the carnival began to lean") than through dramatized on-page beats that show the tightening in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ilya breaks the amber vial (beauty witnessed) while the red vial (extinction signal) stays cold, crystallizing his stance—he certifies destruction but refuses to mourn it as total loss, a renunciation with visible cost (the heritage zone dies on his approval). Causal lens holds: his inspection powers the countdown, his choice to declare stability forecloses reprieve, and the final gestures (photo, print, amber signal) reconfigure the stakes from binary preserve/destroy to witnessing-as-resistance. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the T-minus-twenty ping narrows the window and forces the vial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece layers sensation (mist, bells, water ripples, chiming tubes) to build a charged poetic field, then releases the hummingbird as a Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Charged Poise—that crystallizes the thematic question of belonging to pattern. Orientation anchors (Elias, repair shop, rail depot) arrive early. The cost remains oblique: we see release but no dramatized renunciation or visible price paid on the page; the final smile reads more as confirmation than consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias maps the drone's damage and teaches it to trust sensors, tightening focus from passive repair to active instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the protagonist abandons official orthodoxy to sketch an "honest revision," forecloses the path of bureaucratic compliance, and the falcon's final call explicitly "heralded both discovery and the quiet trouble it would bring." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—condensation patterns, the sketch, the dog-ear fragment converge to reweight the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seam's trickle confirms the dog-ear's promise, narrowing options and forcing the revision choice. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (frozen lake, sagging dock, outpost, atlas editor).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure accumulates through density increase—fog, footsteps, fork vibration, bell tremor, woman's arrival—that reweights the town's dormancy into awakening. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woman's footsteps join Ansel's, the fork flares, bells ring in recognition, and the work begins. Cost is undeniable—two lives choosing to stay in a ruin, committing to slow labor the story has taught us is infinitely patient. Orientation anchors early: who (Ansel), where (ghost town square, archway), when (first dawn in decades). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman arrives and her weight joins his, crystallizing the shared balance he sought.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist becomes the archive with visible cost—shutting down circuits, locking hatches, surrendering agency. The accumulative lens is taught early (silence as weight, gathered hush) and held through the temple discovery to the final surrender. Orientation anchors (control sphere, Station Pelagia, post-burn world) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening: the distress signal leads to the vial, which reframes the mission from study to preservation. Cost is legible in the final image: isolation becomes permanence, observer becomes artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (dusk arrival, lighthouse prison, reef) land within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through nightly listening, corridor discovery, and the revelation of a "library of unfinished paths." Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of belief as cloak reconfigures the tower's function and the protagonist's agency—with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "vanish into sentences." One meaningful deepening (external prison becomes throat of untold stories) satisfies length expectations, though the cost of that realization (what the protagonist sacrifices or risks to achieve it) remains oblique rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors (apprentice, greenhouse, tending trees) appear within the first two sentences. The bead triggers a memory-vision that deepens the protagonist's understanding and reweights the covenant, culminating in a sworn vow that forecloses the option of leaving—a visible cost ("Do this, and one evening the bead will fall silent, and I will walk out..."). The pattern of remembrance accumulates through sensory and metaphorical density, and the closure crystallizes the stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Orren, the wharf, the labyrinth, post-tide evening) arrive within the first 120 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (plate, sleepwalking paths, carved lines) and the final chamber brings a cadence shift when Orren presses his palm to the carving of "a harbor both ruined and renewed." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the act of engraving the altered harbor image crystallizes his stance with felt cost (hand aching, years of solitary labor, town indifference), though the cost is atmospheric rather than a sharp before/after pivot. The lens holds, but the closure lacks a single sharp tightening that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening bus arrival, establishing diaspora returnee, grandmother's village, and research context. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (roots around skulls, carved names, calendar of fruit and mortality) and the final sundial alignment offers Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise where Leila's faith "crept…uncertain but unstoppable" and her life "traced a circle instead of a straight, severed line." The cost is felt (renunciation of linear certainty, acceptance of fragility) and legible in the closing image. One transition from arrival to excavation work across days is clean; causality holds under the accumulative mode without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (golden arcade, dawn, Neve, ebony clipboard). Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: the sender's note intensifies pressure, Neve cycles through trial names, codes appear in margins, and the final folding/walking/holding sequence tightens cadence. Closure is Charged Poise—"feeling the whole future pause on the edge of the drop"—with the cost legible in the refusal to release and the weight of prior aliases. The lens holds; the image reweights prior particulars (names, margins, Arlen) without stating a moral. One beat-level ambiguity: the sender's note and Arlen backstory arrive close together, briefly muddying whether the primary pressure is professional or personal, but the ending coheres both.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Liora, observatory, autumn night before coup). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through rumor, flame-trembling, and stitched adjacencies until the final knotted emptiness reconfigures the prince's path with conceptual cost (becoming a ghost, vanishing from history). However, the closure unit—"move where no story predicts you will move" and "those who walk there vanish completely"—lands as told wisdom rather than a dramatized forfeiture or stance crystallization with felt cost in the scene. The conceptual repricing is legible but the cost remains abstract, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through image layering (mangrove roots as ribs, condensation letters, algae wounds) and resolves via a Resonant Reconfiguration when the unfinished sentence changes to "I was afraid," reweighting the client's unsent letters with visible emotional cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs in the vision-shift when Lysa inhabits the brother's last moment, narrowing options from abstract inquiry to concrete realization. The closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "the place where every apology still waits unspoken."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's reflected face "blurred but undeniably afraid" crystallizes her posture between translator neutrality and emotional graft, with the final image of "unclaimed translations waiting for a tongue" reweighting the shared-anxiety premise. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the coral's passage from evidence to anchor, and the decryption ritual—culminating in a cadence shift that charges the ending. Orientation is clear by line six (who/where/when), and one meaningful deepening occurs when Mara invents the sea-memory line, narrowing her professional stance and making complicity undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered images (orchard fragment, children from past walls, fog glowing from within) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lio realizes the projection channels a "community of forgotten feelings" rather than personal glory—a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (he surrenders ownership). Orientation is anchored early (ruined orchard, fog, Lio arrives). The closure effect is legible and the lens holds, but the cost remains oblique—felt more than visible—keeping the score shy of 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (sound ribs, nested figures, methodical playful work) and holds it through to closure, where the final image reweights prior material: the narrator walks on "newly unsure, companioned by their endless, vivid echoes." Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by line ~4. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator's stance crystallizes from certainty to curiosity with felt cost—abandoning the restoration plan), though the cost remains conceptual and occupational rather than immediately legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mural speaks and the narrator replies, shifting from methodical work to wonder-driven improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers detail about the secret language project, building density through the gourd seed, the map, the entomologist's arrival, culminating in "a quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the work continues with no decisive turn, but the final image crystallizes the collective stance and reconfigures the opening vow. Cost is conceptual (ongoing risk, complicity) rather than a visible forfeiture on the page, which keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet's song, postcard, and coral path converge to restore the moon, and the final image—"ensconcing the night in patient verse"—reweights his insomnia as productive vigil. The orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coral blooms in response to his song, narrowing his stance from passive observation to active negotiation. Cost is implied—he "finally lay down"—but the price reads more as resolution than forfeiture, keeping the closure in the RR/CR zone rather than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accrues density through layered images (glass orchids, bottled storms, fossilized laughter) and reaches closure when the caretaker breathes the wandering melody into an untouched orchid; the library brightens momentarily, then the glow fades—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("something almost, but not quite, saved"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (caretaker, opal library above clouds, chimes), slightly late but functional. Causality is clean: cracked chime → repair → wandering melody persists → caretaker matches it → archives the new name. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the song is searching, prompting his final act. Cost is legible in the fade and the museum's resumption of suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat (archive, linguist, Liora backstory). The causal lens holds: silence → archive quest → Arithene discovery → vow construction → meeting departure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vow "settled into my throat" and the protagonist steps toward the meeting with "something steadier," crystallizing the stance with felt internal cost (can no longer speak half-truths). The cost is legible in the final image's "frantic rhythm" beneath "steadier" music, though the meeting itself remains off-page, so the social price is anticipated rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines (Arlen, amphitheater, dormant volcano, present continuous as council arrives). Drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: pressure accumulates through the council's clashing edicts, and Arlen's proposal (rotating floodgates, shared mercy encoded in gears) crystallizes a stance that reconfigures the conflict. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the councilors stepping forward to adjust the chain into a circle, with the felt alignment in Arlen's chest—though the conceptual cost (no permanent supremacy, rotating vulnerability) is more implied than viscerally dramatized on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when voices collide and Arlen raises the chain to interrupt, narrowing options toward collective agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis transitioning to Decisive Change: Noel writes and sends the unfinished song, foreclosing his hermetic refuge with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dust, meteorite, pigeons, and song fragments build density until the woman's arrival forces the pattern to break and crystallize. Causality is clean: the woman's return visits and the sister's death anchor the final act. One weak seam: "Across learning to trust again" is vague timeframe compression that could anchor more concretely, but the payoff recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors promptly (sky rearranged, town on terrace, narrator is Map). The piece accumulates symbolic density through furniture codes, maze shifts, and thresholds, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator chooses not to cross, understanding that the father's vanishing calibrates the world's balance. Cost is legible: permanent separation and the "sacred ache" of that necessary distance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chair-table experiment physically transports the narrator into the maze, tightening causality under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of "belonging") with visible cost: the protagonist abandons their identity as star-reader to become a listener. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases through layered images (feather, lights, shrimp), pattern breaks when the protagonist stops diagnosing and starts co-creating, and the final cadence shift ("breathing rhythm, teaching me how to belong by listening") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by line 7 (Mira at airlock, facility context). One meaningful deepening occurs when voluntary movement toward half-lit zones reveals the core insight.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Lio, geode cave, sifting foam) land by ~100 words. The story tightens once—seeds lead to unfinished crystal, reframing vanished paths as postponement rather than erasure—and the closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lio accepts perpetual incompleteness, labels paths "Not yet, but soon," and returns to work with renewed purpose. Cost is conceptual and felt (the ache of things half-formed), legible in the final image. The deepening is meaningful but gentle; one additional causal pivot would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when), and the piece teaches its accumulative/lyric lens early through imagistic language and pattern-building. However, the closure unit—Marcus tilting the board so "new moves became visible"—is asserted rather than demonstrated with visible or felt cost; the woman holds the bishop and "considers," but no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a path. The final paragraphs offer thematic summary ("he was not here to dazzle, but to tilt the board") instead of a scene beat that reweights prior material. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence shift or charged image could qualify as RR, but the ending diffuses into stillness without undeniable pressure or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through lyric patterning, the moonstone ritual sequence, and the final memory-trade that reweights exile as "quiet rebellion." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing—Mareh's exile shifts from sanctuary to resistance—with visible cost (brother's face unmoors). One meaningful deepening (the price paid after inscription) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator layers observations of mist, atrium, pond rings, and fracture lines to build a thematic meditation on preservation versus progress. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final request for "one more day" reweights the council's efficiency calculus against unmeasured value—but the cost remains abstract (no on-page consequence of the delay, no visible trade-off). The harbormaster's acquiescence ("he did not stop me") deflates tension rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The story accumulates pressure through layered backstory anchored to the present stimulus (Maya's shock mirroring Rafe's past), and the final confession reweights the porcelain box's meaning. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (ridge path, post-fire, helmet in hand). Cost is legible in "words...scraped on the way out" and the act of breaking twenty years of silence, though the closure leans more on Maya's receptive listening than a decisive change in either character's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the protagonist arranges and rearranges objects while the gauge needle responds, building pressure through pattern iteration until the final configuration yields "modest but undeniable ascent." Orientation anchors (grotto, narrator with gauge, tonight) land by line 3. Closure is Charged Poise: the final needle position crystallizes options with felt cost ("enough to begin"), reconfiguring prior material without requiring a decisive physical act. The cost is legible in the removal of bleak clippings and the grief for "versions of us who might settle there," though the conceptual weight slightly outpaces the dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis (staying to listen) with visible cost: the protagonist accepts the burden of unfinished work and forgoes the option to walk away. Orientation anchors (ivy-veiled passage, afternoon, climate-shifted ruins) arrive early. The Accumulative lens is inferred and held: discoveries layer (diaries, film negative, echoes) and culminate in a stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist hums Mara's pitch and receives the building's "attention," narrowing options to either flee or commit. Cost is legible in the final lines: redrawing maps, staying until "the walls finished dreaming."

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first third (terrace, spring, night, painter arrives). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through layered mirage-visions and the borrowed heartbeat's ticking cost, culminating in the girl's request that deepens the painter's commitment and reweights the bargain's price. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the painter shifts their melody to include the girl, expanding the gift's reach while the cost—"someday the clockmaker would ask for it back"—remains undeniable and now shared. The causal chain (painter hums → mirrors show → girl arrives → shared song alters her brother's dream) is clean, and the final image of the boy stepping back from water delivers felt consequence. Slight penalty for the vignettes (fisherman's daughter, baker, boy) functioning more as atmospheric accumulation than direct escalation of the painter's own stake.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual elements (salt, ash, water), repeated phrases ("operatively gentle," "price of redemption"), and density build toward the signing moment where both men concede with visible cost ("something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth"). Closure is Earned Stasis—the negotiator admits justice has been "bartered for survivable disappointment," a renunciation with conceptual cost made legible on the page. The lens holds and the final image ("sky kept turning, unimpressed yet slightly less condemned") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (helicopter, salt flat, protagonist's project). The dominant stake—preserving the echo as absolution—is signaled early and tightens through the crack-map discovery to the egg release. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist offers the egg to "the cracked map and the lingering echo," crystallizing his stance with felt cost (kneeling in mud, releasing the relic, trusting forces beyond control). The lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: prior ruthlessness motivates the gesture, and the final image reweights all prior "optimization" through one irreversible act. Cost is visible in the physical submission and conceptual in the arrogant absurdity of the offering.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece accumulates echoes through layered image and ritual action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Iri exhales the hush upward, crystallizing the palace's new state of listening and foreclosing her safe passage. Cost is legible: treason sensed, rebellion begun. Orientation is established by ~100 words (palace, courtyard, Iri's role, snow, bells). The descent and sanctuary sequence coheres spatially. One meaningful deepening occurs when Iri shifts from harvest-as-ordered to weaving-as-uprising, narrowing her options and charging the final image. A minor causality softness: the king's order and Iri's counter-intent are declared rather than dramatized through prior friction, so the turn feels more thematic than causally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection, argument aftermath, and the narrator's confession, then crystallizes in the mutual storytelling exercise that reweights all prior positions. Cost is legible: "orbit together" versus "escape" reconfigures the opening's "blind eye" and the narrator's protective distance. Orientation anchors promptly (dome school, calligrapher, post-argument night). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator reveals the festival failure, narrowing options and forcing the final vulnerable exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the world had bent around one small history and let it arrive" crystallizes the stakes with undeniable pressure, and the final image ("The sky, embarrassed and forgiven, resumed its wandering") reweights the opening premise with felt cost—the acknowledgment that the monarch "would not live long" but has been honored. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (passenger pigeons, moth wing, grasses) and a cadence shift at closure deepens the dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) with visible cost (the protagonist's acceptance of transience). Orientation is anchored early (grotto, Erin, monarch) and the two-shard structure (historical reflection, present action) resolves cleanly to a single closure unit. One meaningful tightening occurs when the monarch reaches the heart of the grotto and drinks, altering the emotional and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors—who (lost wax caster), where (icebound sanctum), when (after forgiving)—arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (rope, bells, organ scrap) and a cadence shift at "the rope began to sing," culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist stays, recasting vocation from bronze to sound) with conceptual cost legible in the final lines. One minor causality seam: the street organ scrap "throbbed" in the pocket earlier, yet its literal function in the rope-work remains implied rather than dramatized, creating slight ambiguity in the mechanics of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—coherent pressure (storm, flooding, bunker failure) forces stance crystallization while dream-pattern accumulates to reweight the directive. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist holds the wafer seal, contemplates sealing versus climbing, and "steps into the present" with visible cost (abandoning the bunker, defying the directive). Orientation anchors (bunker, Foresight, wafer seal, directive) land within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening: the storm's arrival forces the final choice between two incompatible paths. Cost is legible on the page: he forecloses survival-by-obedience to pursue living-wrongly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (astronomer, palace-museum, dusk, between regimes). Causality is clean: Tammuz arrives with tile → decodes numerals → rigs floodlights → tests conjunction → one planet aligns → clouds reveal new stars matching old notes → he shuts down and leaves. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "encrypted devotion reciprocated, not with certainty, but with a quiet, usable doubt" reweights the stakes with conceptual cost (he cannot exhaust the question). The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texturing; the final image lands cleanly under the dominant lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the planet slides into the node, crystallizing his doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist releases the rehearsed narrative and feels a note "bloom inside my chest" while the box remains silent—Charged Poise with conceptual cost). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the sanctuary's shifting walls and layered sensory recursions, holding it through the cellular-memory sequence to a final cadence shift that reweights resentment as "repeating the wound as identity." Causality remains legible: the broken music box triggers the sanctuary's reality-shift, which forces the body to remember the true sequence. One meaningful deepening (the car scene reappearing with corrected blame) suffices at this length. Minor slip: the sanctuary's mechanics ("cellular memory," reality shifts) are asserted more than demonstrated, but the closure effect remains undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density increase (fog thickening, frost brightening, dream fragments appearing) and cadence shift at closure when figure and maker merge. Orientation anchors (mirror maker, ruined orchard, twilight) land early. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (boundaries erased between dream and maker) with felt cost (his face goes translucent, "edges still smudged"). One meaningful deepening—synchronized breathing enabling the trap—sufficiently tightens options under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered reflections on contract versus vow, culminating in the protagonist's spoken bargain with the orchard and the petal-rain response. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis): he commits to tending without ownership, the trees respond, and the final image of his daughter's voice in the rustling reweights prior material with conceptual cost—he cannot reclaim her, only steward the space she might return to. Orientation is clear by the opening beat (cathedral, orchard, breach of contract). One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from passive regret to active caretaking.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (orchard, annotations, cameo blank, bathroom mirror) and a cadence shift occurs when the mirror becomes permeable. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elias recognizes nonlinear inheritance as "custodial duty" and steps into the orchard, reweighting his role with conceptual cost (defying regulations carved on the asteroid). The cost is implied rather than visceral; the final image recharges prior material but the felt price remains oblique, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The map-of-gaps pattern builds coherently from diary to clerk negotiation to the circular chamber. Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—Lysa's margin-answer reconfigures the rescue premise with visible cost (she commits to join him rather than undo the past). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Lysa arrives post-disturbance, western stacks). One meaningful deepening occurs when she reaches the unlearned-lessons library and the book opens to her refusal; the margin-writing crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in the final image: she adds a rescue mission to the shelves, forecloses simple reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (carnival ship, foggy bay, protagonist as chimera twin discoverer) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (mirrors, funhouse, theater-into-garden transformation) and the closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist chooses to stay and rewrite rather than recapture, forecloses the professional path with conceptual cost. The garden reveal ("a seed trapped in our shared marrow") reweights the external quest as internal, and the final image of rewriting together charges prior material. Cost is legible but remains largely felt/conceptual rather than a decisive physical forfeiture; the "urge to recapture...loosened" is a meaningful stance shift but the price paid (professional identity, the world's expectations) is implied more than dramatized in a concrete beat. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through discovery (door → seal → rope → parchment) and the clock's thirteen chimes signal surplus time, prompting the braiding task. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lysa steps back "carrying careful remembrance," the treaty's terms now legible, the door returned to nonexistence—options reweighted, cost felt. The causal chain is motivated by her archival instinct, and the final image charges prior material. One meaningful deepening (seal warming, words surfacing) tightens the stakes sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through layered sensory beats—thunder, ice fractures, luminous spores—culminating in the mapkeeper conjuring the bloom of hush, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where stillness is "forged" against the storm's invasion with the cost made visible in the final image: "a great soft-edged emptiness that cupped the storm-sound and held it like a hammer finally laid down." One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone's fractures mirror the mapkeeper's heart, tightening the stakes before the conjuring act. No causality breaks; the inferred lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the prism catches starlight, the hush cracks, and the child's coordinates spill out—Keeper's eleven-year search succeeds in proving pattern survived, though the universe never answered. The cost is visible and poignant: he hears his own abandoned plea, confirming both that meaning persisted and that no help came. Drive lens is Situational with Accumulative texture (star-charting pressure, comet coincidence, retrocognitive tangling); escalation coheres as stubborn hope meets uncharted light, the geometry snaps, and the shard releases its message. Orientation anchors early (custodian, pavilion, post-collapse dusk, prism on pedestal) with no debt. One meaningful deepening: the comet's arrival and lattice-alignment choice tighten all prior charting into a single obedient beam.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory particulars (crystal visions, shadow measurements, storm shifts) and the final image—"certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten"—delivers Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (the city's ignorance of its own rescued memories). Orientation anchors immediately (archivist, observatory, twilight). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "children might soon forget" and works faster, tightening urgency. Cost is conceptual and felt in his "chest tightened" and the city's oblivious dependence, landing cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (wandering designer, blooming fortress courtyard, dusk/night) land clearly within the first third. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, chants, and mosaic assembly toward the final image of the fiery hand. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spectacle executes, offering a note of defiance), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page consequence shows what the designer or garrison forfeits or risks beyond effort. The causal chain is clean (arrival → preparation → ignition), yet the ending feels more like completion than decisive change or charged poise with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns; the pause deepens and reweights the stake. Orientation anchors early (grotto, tide, Lysa opposite). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's realization that "to foresee was not to predict the single future, but to notice how many futures brushed against this moment" reconfigures the dominant stake (choosing inland versus coast) and the decision "seeped in like groundwater" forecloses passivity with felt cost. The cost is legible in the renunciation of waiting for certainty and the commitment to seasonal return.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through silence-collecting beats, intensifies during the shared inversion, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the father's recognition that bunkers were built to keep silence out, followed by mutual acceptance). The "shared vocabulary of silences, sprouting quietly between us" delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the father's entire bunker-building logic is reweighted. Orientation is clean by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the father stays for the second inversion, altering their relational stance with visible cost (his unspoken fear confronted).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around the accumulation of shared stillness, with the blue line visualizing pressure and the terrace functioning as both destination and metaphor. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Rian, gondola platform, night shift). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): silence stops being absence and becomes shared shelter, and the final image of "a bridge made of gentled breaths" crystallizes the shift with conceptual cost (the passengers relinquish noise, Rian stakes his experiment). One tightening deepens throughout the ride; causality within the accumulative mode is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening moves (Lore Keeper, Cascading Verge, before midnight); the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through the orchard, murals, and stairway until the final image reweights the throne premise. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: Ilya's insertion of the ruby flake dissolves the throne and redefines memory governance as refusal rather than control. Cost is conceptually legible—he forecloses fixed memory and the future's plea—but the emotional or tactical price remains oblique, limiting high-band entry. One meaningful deepening (the mural visions, the stairway's archival chimes) tightens options under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the sanctuary materializes Mara's habit of leaving, scars become a language, and the final breath reconfigures her relationship to silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "one more bridge began to burn in a different direction" reweights the premise with felt pressure, though the conceptual cost remains oblique—we don't see an on-page forfeiture or a live option foreclosed. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored within the opener), and the lens holds without contradiction through the textural crescendo of shared scars and aligned breath.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara grasps the hatch wheel as the bolt clicks in sympathetic rhythm, crystallizing the tension between old lie and new door with undeniable pressure and felt cost (she risks repeating a trap). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases from failing pumps → messages from parallel Maras → hatch revelation, culminating in a final image that reweights her past prop as present tool. One meaningful tightening (the hatch reveal) narrows options and the ending reconfigures her relationship to shortcuts versus novelty.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Aurel, Palatine Library, evening, seeking hidden truth). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered memories, Mara's physics, and finally the queen's recorded voice, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the ring's placement and standing-wave metaphor reweight the dynasty's collapse. The closure image—"a tiny crest of possibility could topple a whole, brittle pattern"—lands with conceptual cost (the collapse was internal, not external force), though the felt price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when the voice emerges and recontextualizes all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening beats. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through charged images (masks, spinning fruits, the program) and cadence shifts ("Then you become the first thing this orchard has ever grown that cannot be predicted"). The closure unit is Charged Poise—Calder's declaration "I will stay...but I will not serve" crystallizes his stance and forecloses allegiance to the king with felt cost (exile implied, "the future had just unsnapped its strings"). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the final image reweights prior material. Cost is legible: he steps outside duty and predictability, losing the identity that defined him.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the story teaches its pattern of layered visits and dust-reading early, then deepens through the button discovery and climaxes in Mara's final resolve to "keep examining the unknown." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she remains broken-hearted but commits to her mission with visible cost (solitude, ongoing grief). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button unlocks a brother's story, reweighting all prior file work and cementing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: puddle reflections → lagoon → phone booth → archival deposit builds pattern and density. Orientation anchors (Lio, markets, tram yard) arrive within the opening third. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the strip of paper and the instruction reweight the entire archive deposit as a future action with conceptual cost ("to hold the line"). However, the cost remains implicit—there is no on-page forfeiture or visible tactical shift after receiving the strip. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than it demonstrates felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (saxophonist), where (lakeshore grotto), and when (dawn) by the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: backstory accrues meaning, the grotto setting accumulates ritual repetition, and the climactic refusal (leaving gaps in the tune) crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise with felt cost ("eerie nostalgia for a disaster that might now refuse to happen"). The causal link between the club prophecy and the grotto reversal is motivated by dream-instructions and persistent guilt. One brief ambiguity: the phrase "as dewdrops form" recurs but its temporal bracketing isn't tight enough to create urgent pressure; the escalation is textural rather than clock-driven, which fits the lens but leaves cost slightly diffuse until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The arbor, leaves, and monuments accumulate meaning across beats; the moonstone leaf triggers a deepening that reweights Lio's sorting into an alphabet the valley can share. Closure lands on-page with Lio planting seeds, a Decisive Change with felt cost (stepping from listening into speaking). Orientation is anchored early (arbor, Lio, seed-sorting). Weakness: the voice's arrival and leaf-map feel slightly convenient, delivering the pattern rather than forcing Lio to decode it through prior pressure. The causal chain from sorting to planting is present but leans on the voice's exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of motif (clocks, directions, Perhaps) builds to a cadence shift where Eli begins attaching hands that hesitate—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The transition from depot to cavern to greenhouse reads legibly, pattern taught early. Cost is felt in the renunciation of certainty and the choice to leave clock faces open. One meaningful deepening (compass rose reweights "Perhaps" from threat to direction) suffices at this length and charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through layered imagery (coin, crucible, vapor-vision, crack, new sign) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the thirteenth sign and Eira's dual recognition reweight Arlen's disappearance from "lost" to "still walking, path uncharted." Cost is conceptual and felt—she steps back "with a name tempered but unclosed"—though the price could be more viscerally legible on the page (what exactly has she foreclosed for herself?).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge's discord slides toward "rough, unlikely harmony" when Mara nudges confessions toward their absurd edges, and laughter stitches through the music "like gold mending a broken bowl." The felt cost is her solo descent and ritual exposure; the world "tilts, just slightly, toward healing" with legible before/after. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of spectral voices and the harp's misalignment build until the cadence shift at "giggles up the stone." One micro turn (wind falters, first confession breaks free) sets up the cascade without violating the coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who (interrogation survivor), where (ultraviolet forest), and when (post-anesthesia) by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory detail, the forest's equations, and the frame's proposition, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the protagonist steps into the frame with visible cost (surrendering "the last unquantified parts" to a system echoing her abusers). The cost is legible in "at last my pain began to factor"—the final image reweights the entire journey. One tightening: the walk toward the clearing compresses prior trauma into convergent "lines of force," and the frame's proposition crystallizes the ethical calculus. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by approximately line 5 (alchemist's market, narrator as translator, dream-to-reality crossing). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the market visit layers sensory detail and thematic weight toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure attempts Charged Poise (the narrator holding the shard with newfound awareness of past failures), but the cost remains abstract—shame is named, not dramatized in a choice that alters present options. The final paragraph summarizes prior regrets rather than enacting a present forfeiture or stance crystallization with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered observation (dust patterns, ceiling bulge, ghost testimony) until the mainspring touch triggers the upside-down room reveal—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the "ceilings as agreements" thesis with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from passive observation to active engagement, narrowing options. The closure image lands cleanly under the chosen lens, reweighting prior "cracks in the facade" material, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Ilen is, where exactly he stands, and what the library's physical layout entails remain vague past the 120-word mark, though the disorientation is somewhat atmospheric. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the frost pattern, the whisper, and the press converge to produce a page that "folds timeline." The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the treaties rewrite themselves and the library accepts possibility—but the cost is asserted ("certainty had to share a desk with possibility") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors Mara on the baroque asteroid within the first paragraph. The piece moves through escalating discoveries (shard → sealed chambers → vase shards → projection onto mirrors) that reweight the dominant stake: whether history can be reimagined. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara walks alone covering mirrors "not to keep time out, but to keep these reimagined futures from leaking away"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (the visions will never replace official histories, yet their glow burnishes her calcified sorrow). One meaningful deepening occurs when the funerary/rehearsal dispute splits scholars, forcing Mara to devise an alternate telling.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (workshop → chamber), and when (midnight that won't end) by ~150 words; the delay is noticeable but not fatal. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (rust, chimes, song, light), and the closure reweights the midnight-bargain through the music box's "truthful song," achieving Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the box now "faintly warm," the city "loosens the breath it had forgotten holding"). The causal chain is thin—Elias's humming and verbal covenant adjustment solve the problem without prior struggle—limiting escalation clarity. Cost is present but abstract: the rust "adjusts its wording" offstage, and no foreclosed path is visible for Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational elements: sensory details and recurring images (jars, compass, hinges, rain-on-stone scent) build density until the lagoon crystallizes all prior material. Closure achieves Charged Poise—Elias sitting in the boat, the hinge "half open, waiting for a hand"—with the cost felt in his acceptance that comprehension may fail. Orientation anchors cleanly (abandoned rail line, post-factory shutdown, dusk, drainage ditch, cave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the psychometry vision reveals the factory's true purpose as guardian, reweighting all prior collection as preparation for this threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the storm, archway, and slide build density toward a final image of reimagining the map. Orientation anchors (Mara, van, coast, storm-tossed archway) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara tucks away the slide "not an artifact but a question" and drives back with no blue line, aware she is "lost and learning and still exactly where the story needed her." Yet the conceptual cost remains oblique—no concrete forfeiture or tactical change on the page makes the "before/after" legible with felt weight, only the assertion that she now carries a new question.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly (train station, Bellmare, spring morning) and follows a single continuous scene with one transition (pavilion to cathedral). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (postcards, dawn/night, glass layers) build toward a final image that reweights the opening question. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding shared via image and intention to propagate murals), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible tradeoff. The causality is clean through Liora's guidance, the climb, and the realization, though the mechanics of the glass-light-shadow interaction are told in summary rather than shown step-by-step, weakening the escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates symbolic density (diary, debris messages, lagoon) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maris kneels and pledges expanded cataloging, a stance crystallization. Orientation anchors quickly (zeppelin library, archivist, dusk coastline). One meaningful deepening occurs when the diary's code connects to the shore semaphore, reweighting the archive's purpose. Cost is felt in her acceptance of contradiction and the diary's increased weight, though the physical kneel reads more as ritual than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bottle warms when his diagrams cohere, he understands its true test, and footsteps sound—options crystallize with conceptual cost (abandoning certainty, accepting fallibility). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered reflection, pattern-making, and the bottle's symbolic weight until the cadence shifts at the ending image. Orientation anchors (alchemist, workshop, post-wish cove) arrive early. One tightening: from studying the bottle to conceiving civilization-scale redesign. The cost is legible in his acceptance that designs "offered no guarantees." Mild penalty: much of the middle is reflective summary rather than beats that narrow options through concrete試み.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered archival imagery (fruit as labels, wax as ghost, listening as immersion) and pivots at the realization that the recording is "an accidental prophecy" from a prior oath-scribe. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final recognition reweights the archive's purpose—emotional patterns mistaken for outcomes—with conceptual cost (the speaker "had spoken an accidental prophecy"). Orientation is clean by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lan understands the recording describes feeling-patterns, not events, charging the premise without requiring a causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist's acceptance of the vortex and decision to reopen the atrium is a Decisive Change with visible cost (years of life) earned by the escalating pressure of the scene. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—memories and sensory density build to a crystallized choice. Orientation anchors (atrium, protagonist age, egg state) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. One minor pressure plateau occurs mid-scene when exposition about seed-saver circles and time-seed rumors pauses momentum slightly, but the final beat reweights all prior material without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Elias steps away from the switch, cupping his hands to listen to the valley's silence—a Resonant Reconfiguration that crystallizes the zero-hour choice with undeniable cost (lives at risk) even as the outcome remains open. The piece holds a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens: pressure coheres through atmospheric intensification (shadow, needle jump, the cusp of red) and his stance crystallizes in the final beat. Single continuous scene, single POV, one dominant stake (when to sound the alarm), orientation anchored early, and the drive lens is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the janitor's promise to keep watching crystallizes his stance shift from shadow to witness, with the cost legible in "chest hurt" and the spaciousness of opening. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered projections, the pattern breaks when stars slow to stillness, and the final cadence reweights his labor from cleaning to witnessing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lantern glass reveals falling stars as human moments, narrowing his understanding and raising the stakes of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (recluse, apiary, ghosts now visible, stained glass box). The piece reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered exposition of the covenant and intensifies when Mara speaks, then resolves via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist renews commitment to witness with conceptual cost legible in Mara's acceptance and the "hush so dense." One escalation beat (Mara's arrival and her reaching toward the scroll) narrows the protagonist's options but does not foreclose a live path in causal terms; the closure reweights the covenant as witness rather than prison. The causality is weaker—most of the story is layered reflection and world-building rather than linked decisions—though the final exchange lands with undeniable thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the piece pools observations and charged images toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (silo, narrator role, town) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraphs. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the capsule as lender rather than borrower, the town learning to float—legible on the page with conceptual cost (the leak worsening, yesterday pooling with tomorrow). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes the job is "not to guard the fragment, but to teach the town how to float," reweighting all prior watching.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (cobalt lagoon, shoreline poet, post-rain). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian opens his notebook and writes "line after unfinished line," crystallizing his acceptance of discord as companionship—a stance earned by the feather encounter and the being's validation. Cost is felt: he trades the desire for harmony for co-existence with discord. One meaningful deepening (the feather's pulse → hearing dissonances → harmonizing them) tightens the stake. Minor issue: the being's explicit validation ("you have left it ajar") slightly externalizes what the prior images had already charged.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: pressure builds through copper-wire experiments that unlock architectural secrets, culminating in monks walking "more slowly...vowels rounded by leaves." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the caretaker completes his translation project and dies mid-negotiation, forecloses the path of waiting passively, cost visible in "between them, listening." Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (island, verdict, six months, orchard). One tightening: storm unlocks hidden chambers, validating his intuition and shifting the project from engineering to translation. The death arrives on-page but feels slightly soft—Cost Proof Test satisfied by "everything negotiated peace" reweighting prior "architectural secrets," though the final image could land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (tower, spring, after first contact, pilgrimage directive). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases as footprints multiply, equations curl in their edges, and the spiral clearing gathers statue path, moss patterns, and the amber into a charged final image. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator stands in the center, waiting, homecoming poised between thunder and bronze quiet—with conceptual cost legible (the species at the threshold, decision unmade). One tightening occurs when footprints triple and equations appear, reweighting the pilgrimage from rote path to chain reaction. Cost is felt but oblique; no concrete forfeiture or agency shift lands on the page, keeping this shy of high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: coachman, harbor, post-reef twilight by ~80 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure: the coachman completes his ritual placement, imagines the garden's rise "neither hopeful nor sad, merely accurate," and the birds answer in what sounds like "mere noise" to the uninitiated—reweighting his solitary labor with conceptual cost (isolation, invisibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from general work to the final pod placement at the war's fiercest point, narrowing focus. The botanist's backstory is substantial (~25%) but anchored in present objects (seed case, pods) and primes the closure's charge. Cost is legible: he persists in invisible work that will outlast him, bound by a dead woman's grammar-defying instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the decision to let others hear the cylinder reweights the dominant stake (whether the first city had to burn) and forecloses the option of forgetting with conceptual cost legible in "forgetting was another kind of fire." The piece operates under a Situational lens—pressure mounts through the stranger's arrival, the riddle's revelation, and the collective listening—and the final image crystallizes options without requiring a decisive physical act. Orientation anchors (scrapyard, narrator, Barrow) arrive early; the single scene holds coherence through one transition (stranger's arrival). One tightening: the cylinder's multi-vocal revelation narrows options from individual grief to collective reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian's declaration "This is north enough for me" crystallizes his stance—choosing directional seeking over fixed certainty—with undeniable pressure and a felt cost (isolation, status as pariah, defiance of shutdown orders). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (charcoal maps, dilation halos, doubled stars) and the cadence shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake (finding orientation in distortion). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (station, observation deck, Elian). One minor causality gap: the intrusion at the end is not causally prepared, but it functions as a micro turn that charges the final line rather than resolving conflict, so it does not break closure logic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory density and the sundial's transformation rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lid clicks, questions brush the protagonist, and the final line reconfigures the script with felt cost ("unarmed"). Orientation anchors quickly (spire, sky, climb). One meaningful deepening occurs when the king is placed and the lid responds. Cost is visible in the renunciation of cynicism and the acceptance of vulnerability, though the phrase "agree to meet it unarmed" verges on abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens. The piece builds density through layered fragments (the crisis actor past, the gallery's acoustic function, the pawnless chessboard exhibit, the interregnum context) that converge at closure. The final act—deciding to inscribe the archive into the floor before eviction—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator crystallizes a stance of preservation through embodied action, foreclosing retreat with visible cost (the gallery "kept whispering" after closure, a nomadic repository). Cost is legible in the renunciation of paper permanence and the commitment to an ephemeral, bodily archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy recites the narrator's own disaster report and the parents dismiss it as staged, forcing the narrator to choose silence over correction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (mountain bookstore, memory-burdened narrator, "after remembering becomes painful") land within the first ~150 words. The piece accumulates density through layered images (torn granite, moving ink, lost language stone) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: speaking the buried dialect cracks open sealed rooms, reweighting survival-through-forgetting into survival-through-recovery. Cost is legible ("cracking open," "awkward music," reversal of "careful erasures"). One persistent constraint—the substituting aisles and threat of being lost—shapes tactics (following the map, descending to hidden stacks). The accumulative method holds; closure lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Elior forgoes redemptive applause and instead sifts motives, finding the "smaller and harder" wish to live beside mistakes; pulling the last thread releases the village and resumes time. The drive lens is Causal (strategy → winnowing → release) with lyric accumulation in the tapestry's texture. One meaningful tightening: the final crossing of "thread and time" that makes the village breathe. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (exiled tutor, frozen village, platinum tower). Cost is legible in the renunciation of pride and the quiet, decisive gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (echoes, refractions, overlapping confessions) and accumulates density through the poetry-session frame until the final cadence shift reweights Maren's stance from single truth to layered self-knowledge. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable pressure and felt cost—she descends not to confess but to carry complexity. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. Cost is legible: she risks rejection "whole" and loses the comfort of narrow blame.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through recursive motifs (acid, charm, pockmarks, kintsugi) and a cadence shift at the descent; the final image—sigils sealing the fracture, the workshop "filling with a different kind of breath"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Corin's collapse and the cracked cylinder. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph ("workshop creaked… drifted over the acid sea… Corin paced"). One minor causality softness: the pockmarks "flared with faint auric lines" without clear trigger beyond his touch, but the neutralizing vapors and his narration provide enough scaffolding to keep the turn motivated under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered reflection and the cavern discovery, culminating in the painting act as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—witnessing and bringing back proof). Orientation anchors late (~150 words for full spatial grounding in the cave), triggering a −0.3 penalty, but the closure unit lands cleanly with felt cost (the promise kept, the secret held). Causality is elliptical yet legible under the accumulative lens; the cracked mirror frames expectation and the painted shell charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through contrasts (heat/cool, shout/whisper, horn/scent) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the boats turn without the horn, Jorah's shoulders drop, and Mara's final line crystallizes her method's success with undeniable social and relational cost (she has defied protocol and altered their dynamic). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent "purifies intentions" and the lens glows unbidden, narrowing Mara's path to full commitment. Cost is legible: she has bypassed the established system, and Jorah's whispered question signals the relationship is now on uncertain ground.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (signal station, hydraulics failed, midnight call). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density rises through layered imagery (station settling, moon phases, reverse migration) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Rian knowingly builds a false map ("I lie") to offer solace, forecloses honest cartography, and stakes the cost on shared imagining. The closure image—"where losing began, and maybe...where it can soften"—reweights the premise with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the final act charges prior material without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors arrive early (ravine orchard, post-virus isolation). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the glass eye clears and becomes "only ever a mirror we had agreed to fear," a conceptual repricing that disperses collective terror into mutual witness with felt cost (the loss of mystical safety). The mycelial mapping tightens pressure across beats, and the storm arrival triggers the final reweighting. One small cost-legibility issue: the precise mechanism by which "seeing one another" constitutes survival remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—mist, gaps, absences as meaningful pressure—and holds through closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration arrives on-page when the narrator pins the Edelweiss and waits, crystallizing a shift from investigator to participant with visible cost (the abandoned report, the foreclosed inquiry). One escalation: the walk along the dock teaching the narrator to observe gaps rather than events reweights the initial stake.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements (protagonist follows taught pattern—ants, water, chip coordinates—to a crystallized choice). Closure achieves Charged Poise: Elias sets the chip against undecided stone and follows through, foreclosing the safe path with felt cost ("not knowing which life... only that at last he was choosing"). Orientation anchors quickly (shop, then upstream journey). One meaningful tightening occurs when rising water forces the choice. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of certainty and the shop.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: bleeding starlight reappears with escalating imagery (dream → grotto chamber), and the final "Isera remembered" attempts to reweight prior material. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (queen, palace, mountain realm). However, the closure unit lacks legible cost—"remembered" what, with what consequence? The ending shifts to pure summary without showing the reconfiguration or its price. One meaningful deepening occurs (storm pressure + Ralen's challenge → her refusal), but the final beat does not deliver a decisive change or conceptual repricing visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure). Orientation anchors are present within the first ~15% (Lio at the ember nexus, working on pocket suns). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lio's realization that equations "meant to send energy outward" must now "solve for us, by returning differently" reweights the entire premise with felt conceptual cost—the shift from external utility to intimate preservation. One causal tightening occurs when Kira and Jash arrive with the shell and their departure plan, narrowing Lio's options and forcing the revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (ranger cabin, top bunk, mountain setting, therapist reference). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts "jaded wonder" as the only honest stance, foreclosing belief in cleaner narratives. Cost is conceptual and felt: he remains "alone in a thin-aired present, tasked to distill chaos." One tightening occurs when he realizes "my future selves were stalking my memories," narrowing his options to active engagement. The hovering-above-graves beat reweights all prior scroll work. Slight deduction: the infirmary concussion is told rather than shown, creating a minor causal gap between the ridge encounter and waking with scrolls.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the screw installation reweights grief into "ordinary miracles" with visible cost ("does not fix her absence"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—water-clock motifs accrue until the screw becomes a gravity point. Orientation anchors quickly (aromatherapist, shop, fog). One tightening deepens the dominant stake (humanizing absence). Cost is legible but slightly abstract ("humanizes the time that follows"), keeping it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through two memory-shard beats (birthmark shame, granary curiosity) that reweight Lan's relationship to his scars. Orientation anchors quickly (floating platform, tea ceremony, master and student). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): scars rearrange into margins rather than wounds, future storms wait, and Lan is "ready to meet them"—options crystallize with visible cost (acceptance of scarred identity, commitment to the scribe path). The cost is felt in the final image: "cradled his cup as if it were an inkwell of weather, every swirling leaf a story he had yet to write." One meaningful deepening via two shard-driven turns is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the act of sending the confession reweights Mirabel's relationship to her work and to Liora's memory with conceptual cost (professional reputation, public admission). Orientation anchors arrive clearly (orchard, conservatory, archive) within the first 120 words. Escalation tightens through density increase: metaphor accumulation ("thunder as jewelry," "echo/cave"), then confession-typing that forecloses the advice-column path. One meaningful deepening is present, and cost is legible in the final beat: "a small electric offering racing out of the archive into wider circuits."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through nested cosmological cycles, the dictionary's shifting definitions, and the circular walk that reveals the chamber. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): No-One places the dictionary at the center, weighs all histories, and the universe unifies—options are crystallized and meaning reconfigured. The cost is conceptual (surrendering multiple timelines) and legible in "only one history, braided from all the others." One meaningful deepening through the spiral walk satisfies the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly (dawn, fjord, station roof), and the piece teaches its lyric-meditative pattern early. The counting-backwards passage deepens pressure by reweighting what the clocks measure, and the final refusal lands as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost made legible: "to open a refusal, to unlock the willingness to be misled." The key's function as metaphor—winding gear versus turning hesitation—reconfigures the premise. One structural seam: the shift from roof observation to introspection back to roof could signal its hinge more clearly for full 8.5+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator's counter-note ("we stay anyway, because staying changes them") reconfigures the premise's odds-versus-safety binary with felt cost—she commits to shared uncertainty. The piece follows an Accumulative lens taught early (layered notes, scrawls, reflections building density) and sustains it through the hospital encounter. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (library, post-heart-attack timeframe, professor daughter). One meaningful deepening: the subway scrawls reweight her journey from evasion to engagement, and the final exchange crystallizes stance with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (glass disc, streetlamp flicker, loops) and deepens when Lena applies her method to Mara's specific crisis. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (tunnel booth, night, Lena alone). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the premise—"stories passed over the dark and did not fall"—with visible conceptual cost (Lena's solitude reconfigured as bridge, not exile). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara's streetlamp synchronizes with Lena's instruction, narrowing options and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors by line three (walnut-ink archivist, blooming jetty, twilight). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered ritual acts (dipping pen, pressing photo, following footprints) until the apparition reweights the covenant premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara's directive and the narrator's return to writing crystallize the work's permanence with undeniable emotional cost. One slip: the apparition's mechanics (footprints moving onto wood, Mara stepping from water) arrive without prior signal of such literal manifestation, a small late rule-change that doesn't break causality but nudges convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and establishes a Situational lens: Kenji arrives at the Exchange with a dilemma (keep the rock and break reciprocity, or participate in the experiment). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"the loneliness shifted from singular to shared"—that reweights his stake without a decisive external act, and the cost (bearing the weight of others' confessions) is felt on the page. The experiment catalyzes connection but does not resolve loneliness, which holds the situational pressure. One friction: the final beat summarizes the shift rather than dramatizing a specific confession or moment that crystallizes it, slightly softening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure. Orrin's kneeling and the phrase "stay" crystallize after density builds through layered languages and remembered voices, reweighting his outward quest with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, platinum compass ring, ultrasonic forest) land cleanly by the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass turns inward and the notes become sentences; closure reweights the premise with felt cost. The pause of shifting constellations bookends the piece, and the final map "no wall could hold" charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal accents. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator accepts death while gently unbending curves, crystallizing that meaning arises from contingent relationships, not erasure. Cost is visible: exile persists, the child cannot return, and the pen "barely wrote." Orientation anchors early (observatory, anomaly, exile). One meaningful deepening occurs when the pen activates and the narrator begins revising history's geometry, narrowing from passive listening to active micro-revisions with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly (harbor, Lena, camera, moonlight) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through signing the spaces between words, thickening silence into fabric, until the final laugh harmonizes—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where pressure crystallizes into felt music. Cost is legible in the trembling hands and "ragged sound," though the advisor's role as facilitator rather than obstacle keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The archive trail accumulates pressure through recurring vandalized objects, building to the tapestry revelation that reweights the protagonist's promise with conceptual cost (burned book vs. carved continuity). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the self-portrait mirrors the protagonist, narrowing the thematic stakes. The closure—staying to translate—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), forecloses the option of returning to cities, and the conceptual cost is legible in the final image of "stitching days into translations." A micro causality slip: "analytically intuitive" enables the protagonist to copy symbols faster than conscious understanding, but we never see this constraint tested or paid for in error.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered imagery (sound wave garden, auric lagoon, entangled memories) and reaches a cadence shift at the ending when the narrator's drumming becomes a signal and the others notice. Orientation anchors (experimental facility, sound garden, narrator as trial subject) land within the first third. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the collective tests the walls of the shared dream, and the final image ("open sky, waiting for whatever song we chose") reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the realization that they are being tuned toward a preferred future). The cost is conceptual and social rather than deeply personal, and the ending hovers at the edge of action rather than landing a decisive turn, but the pattern holds and the reweighting is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: Milo's prior oil work and map study enable the whisper solution, and the inspectors' adjustment creates a legible before/after. Closure lands on the page with Ramos's "slower, thoughtful walk" signaling a stance shift—Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lesson is received without stated moral. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (port maze, geomagnetic storm night, Milo at work). One meaningful tightening (ten-minute countdown, lost inspectors) narrows options and the whisper tactic pays off the constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian's water-light weaving accumulates until the dentist's phone call closes the arc with a Decisive Change (he dials after months of avoidance). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—"heart rattling" and "haltingly" signals the emotional price—and the canal's acceptance of his tremor provides resonant validation. Orientation is swift (cobalt dock, canal, guardian, house, dentist upstairs by paragraph nine). One escalation point (light meets water, dentist responds, call connects) tightens options. Minor causality softness: the guardian's specific water-circle actions feel more metaphoric choreography than a mechanism the dentist could plausibly perceive as reply, though the lens allows this as accumulative pressure rather than strict because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—unspoken words pooling, chess positions mapped to town—and escalates through density increase (phone calls, window pledges, the synchronized reveal). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the council vote shifts without overt confrontation, reweighting the town's future through the collective second thought made visible. Cost is conceptual and felt in the line "citing traffic studies that had not changed at all"—the shift is real but its mechanism is oblique, which fits the "humble rebellion" premise and lands cleanly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive adequately (harbor, Mara, pirate, scrimshaw) within the first third. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric density builds through strain/grace, violence-ended world, disappearing island. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bone-listening moment, but cost remains conceptual and asserted ("to find freedom in embracing one's true nature") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or altered options. The phrase "was the whale's awaiting song" tells the repricing without showing what Mara sacrifices or what path now closes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wooden figure placed among dried stems, the "remade hush" carried as contraband, and Mara's "slight easing" crystallize a before/after with conceptual cost (sedition risk) legible on the page. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (performer, farmhouse, Mandate context). One meaningful deepening: whittling transforms theatrical visit into quiet defiance, narrowing both characters' options.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflections and spatial movement, culminating in Lio's subversive speech and final stride. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (Lio, cobalt atrium, post-ban). The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lio's descent from the dais and walk among pillars crystallizes his rejection of the sanctioned role, reweighting the atrium from forbidden space to reclaimed ground. Cost is felt in the forfeiture of official approval and the implicit risk of renewed punishment. One meaningful deepening occurs when his whispered words shift from performance to "excavation," narrowing his stance from visitor to reclaimer.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, courtyard, post-phoenix dawn) arrive within the first few lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (phoenix rising, marketplace perfection threatening her barter practice, the stranger's request) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the reed falls silent and the plant blooms, reweighting her stake (finding beauty in imperfection) with visible cost (she completes the painting, the sound escapes). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: her refusal of symmetry and her honoring of hesitation allow the trapped note to rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stranger's request raises the impossibility and Mira accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 6 (tower laboratory, blackout aftermath, Elya's role). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elya abandons the prescribed score and discovers connection as co-questioner rather than guide, with the cost felt in her relinquished certainty ("not pilgrims and guide, but two questions"). One meaningful deepening through the visitor's arrival transforms the solitary ritual into mutual exploration. Lens holds; cost is palpable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with clear anchors (observatory, Ela's workbench, ritual of origami placement). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteor shower illuminates her path "as a chain of small awakenings," and she pivots from mourning jewelry to pieces "for the almost-living." The cost is felt in her acknowledgment that "rock bottom was only a temporary floor"—a renunciation of despair with visible forward commitment. One tightening suffices at this length, and the curtain-apparatus pays off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and thematic density through card readings, whispers, and the measuring-tape ritual, ending with a collaborative map that reweights the premise from solitary diagnosis to shared construction. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of placing cards "along the shared axis" and sketching "a way sideways into something patiently unknown" crystallizes a shift from Mara's solo project to a joint venture. However, the cost is felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture or tactical change in the ending beat itself, only the affective charge of "relief" and shared effort. Under the accumulative lens, this cadence shift and density reweighting satisfy closure, but the faintness of enacted cost at the exact ending moment caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—memories coalesce through sequential door-opening—and achieves Conceptual Repricing at closure: "civilizations did not fall because they forgot, but because memory itself became unbearable." Cost is legible in Hiran's vow to "carry every pattern alone," accepting isolation as the price. Orientation anchors (archive, pagoda, Hiran) are present by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs as randomness gives way to sequence, tightening the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio's request to become a moving archive reweights his regret and the library's function, with conceptual cost legible in "luminous regret burning through each word." Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The shadow's discovery, the tape viewing, and Lio's absorption create a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, and the final protocol request reconfigures his role with felt cost. One micro turn (shadow climbing his wrists) sets up the closure without disrupting coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the workshop encounter deepens the weight of the vial and Liora's stance through pattern (the chameleon's shedding metaphor returns with new cost). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora's act of giving the tail tip to be encased in wire crystallizes her choice between self-absolution and public reckoning, and the final image ("a matching gate unlatched") reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Mara shifts from asking people to bleed to reading scars themselves ("ask the tissue itself"), with the cost legible in her question "who tends the living hurt"—she forecloses the helper role. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and plant voices build to the fern's spore-breath and the meteor-hush realization. Orientation anchors (tower, post-surgery dawn) arrive immediately. One minor elision: the exact mechanics of how coffee rings show scar-visions could be slightly clearer, but the conceptual cost remains undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening third. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (unsent letters, deleted scenes, hushed thunder) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's goodbye letters shift from "failures" to "unfinished reels awaiting her choice of ending." Cost reads as felt opportunity rather than decisive forfeiture—Charged Poise qualifies, though the final image stops short of closing a specific door on the page. One meaningful deepening present; causality remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered metaphor and the final image—ideas pouring into the valley—reconfigures the protagonist's burden into shared potential with visible cost (the "ringing emptiness" that replaces pressure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: rest arrives not as resolution but as "space, wide and echoing," a renunciation of hoarding creativity. Cost is legible in the emptying and the shift from "trapped" to "free." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the piece layers density through recurring images (chess clock, sparks, tracks) and shifts cadence from reportage to ritual by the end. Orientation anchors early (glowing dune, guard, post-fire world). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—pressing ear to clock, hearing wave functions collapse, singing gaps—crystallizes the guard's choice to witness and name "unborn journeys" with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (endless vigil without resolution). One meaningful deepening occurs when sparks begin accepting invented schedules and "fresh tracks scar the air," reweighting the premise from memory-keeping to active cultivation of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early, layering translocations and sensory details toward a closure moment. Orientation anchors are present by the mechanical rainforest revelation (~15% in). The closure unit—placing the gear and the resonant hum—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the final line "I let the vision be" crystallizing a stance of acceptance. The cost is felt but oblique: the protagonist surrenders control and prior frameworks. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pool reveals fragmented memories, reweighting the stake from mere curiosity to self-recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via the final breath-and-star answer, reweighting prior imagery with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (Mara, ridgeway, ferry house) arrive by ~15% and transitions are legible. The closure image ("the star within her answered") reconfigures the "unused courage" motif with felt cost, though the cost remains oblique—she has descended but her father's silence and the shop's future hang unresolved. One meaningful deepening occurs in the stairway spiral, sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change: the narrator speaks, fortress cracks, snow roars in, and safety is renounced with immediate physical cost ("bones shattered again, as nerves screamed awake"). The piece teaches its lens early—Causal with lyric density—and holds it: bolt discovery → staircase descent → memory trigger → decision → consequence. Orientation anchors (who: bellhop; where: lobby/staircase; when: during regeneration) arrive within the first ~100 words. One micro turn (woman's revelation) deepens the dominant stake (understanding cost of safety) without fragmenting pressure. The final image reweights the premise: "safety had never been the fortress at all, but the courage to leave it."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of message-seeding across multiple texts, and pressure accumulates through the titan's slow, methodical interventions until the scholar's arrival triggers the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the scholar's certainty collapses with visible cost). Orientation anchors are present early (temple library, diminutive titan, stalled constellations). One structural concern: the scholar's arrival in the final beat feels slightly abrupt, though her exhaustion and flickering form suggest she has crossed time itself to reach this moment, lending causal weight to her presence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist glimpses the vanished sandbar, confirming the rhythm's effect, then is left "drifting moored above paths." The cost is implicit but legible: the protagonist cannot restore the paths, only witness their ghostly return. One meaningful deepening (atlas page → tapping → momentary manifestation) tightens the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens holds; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through layered imagery (opera glasses reframing hulls as cathedrals, stones humming with history, workers' past actions flickering as memory) and converges on Liora's decision to send the message, which reconfigures the lull into potential resumption. Closure is Charged Poise: the wrist-comm line "where the lull ends and the story remembers itself" crystallizes options with felt cost (her trembling fingers signal fear not yet resolved). The cost is present but oblique—trembling marks hesitation, yet no prior scene beat dramatizes what she risks by breaking silence. Orientation is clear early (spaceport, margin of daylight, Liora alone). One meaningful deepening occurs when memory images arrive and she presses her feet into the vibrating deck, reweighting her stake from passive witness to quiet instigator.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (narrator, Teta Lila), where (volcanic hot springs town), and when (reconstruction period) within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: plant-thoughts accumulate pressure through the kite-decoding sequence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the embryo's light bleeds into the spring and "the waters carried it out toward unknown shores." Cost is legible—the council's "last, perfect vessel" is dissolved, and Teta's counter-tradition wins with visible social consequence. The closure reweights the implanted-destiny premise without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mariam's refusal to discard the photograph paired with her ability to walk the path despite the absent lighthouse beam constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration—she has foreclosed magical thinking ("belief died") but anchored a sustainable stillness. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (fig veins/henna patterns, lighthouse/body reaching, pearl/stillness) and the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake (surviving trauma while imagining tomorrow) with visible cost (permanent shoulder seizing, stitched sleep). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when she lists truths that "sit side by side like rocks in the tide"—this deepens her stance from passive endurance to active catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (lighthouse library, Elias, present day). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments gather density through tarot rearrangement, the discovered book, and the descent, building toward a reconfiguration. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization: "possible selves, each one a card returning to its box"), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—"would it hurt less, he wondered, to live divided yet shining" poses a question rather than paying a legible price. The causality of redesign-by-rearrangement is asserted more than dramatized, and the final image doesn't decisively foreclose a prior path or show what he's sacrificed to reach this insight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening lines). The piece follows a causal through-line: eclipse ends → Iren observes Kesh's disturbance → elders summon him → ink demonstration reveals skipped frames → Iren commits to learning disappearance. The closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Iren places fingertips on ink and loosens self, crystallizing his commitment with the cost of stepping into an unknown vanishing. Lens reads Causal with situational pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink's behavior reframes time as edited deletion rather than slow motion, narrowing Iren's tactical options to "step between cuts."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Ana's choice to disseminate the letter reweights her identity and forecloses compliance, with the cost legible in "both coward and conspirator." The causal lens holds—each beat narrows her options from routine calibration to unauthorized access to the irreversible transmission. One meaningful tightening drives the escalation; the storm's retreat in the penultimate paragraph subtly signals the shift. Cost is visible in her falsified report and the risk she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (Mara, dome, post-tower). The story accumulates pressure through the progression of visitors (hunters, then raiders) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the raiders hesitate and surrender, enacting the "engraved quiet" that has accumulated across the piece. Cost is legible in the grief they feel and Mara's sustained, isolating stance. However, the closure beat itself ("letting the engraved quiet breathe through her") is more lyric echo than a single decisive image that reweights prior material with sharp on-page cost, landing it solidly in the 7-range rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: the fisher refuses to transliterate the echo and lets the question dissolve, forecloing the path of external answers with visible cost (the waves move again in new, broken rhythms). The accumulative lens holds: density builds through layered imagery (sound garden, constellations, rail spike memory) to a decisive moment of refusal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One micro slip: the mechanics of how "voicing silence" locks the waves mid-surge leans abstract, but the cost at closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 4 (Elena, observatory, phone call). The piece follows a causal lens: journalist's revelation → Elena's internal proof-by-contradiction → decision to publish, with each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (switching from silence to public exposure) with felt cost legible in "if there is any trust left" and the image of presses thundering. One substantive reversal (from potential silence to intervention) tightens pressure sufficiently for this length. The logic chain holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: the protagonist offers the saved voicemail, the firmware quiets, and the meteors burn—a clear before/after with felt cost (surrendering the last living trace). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered images (amber, monitor wail, tattoos) and the failsafe letter deepens stakes without reversing them. Orientation is anchored early (laboratory, night, narrator alone) and the causal chain from firmware cry → failsafe instruction → voicemail sacrifice reads cleanly. One friction: the handwritten-letters backstory and the firmware's sudden ability to cry like a newborn arrive without prior setup, creating a small motivational seam that doesn't break the closure but softens its inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Lark, grotto, during the unlearning). The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Lark's theft of the tile shard (causality) changes her perception, enabling the final act of drawing that reweights the grotto's "mess" into "outlined chaos." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she kneels, presses the flake into sand, and draws, crystallizing her stance with visible cost ("frightened her," "never again pretend her art was harmless"). The final image recharges the mandala motif and makes the emotional price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—layered time-vision fragments build toward the naming ritual and final opening gesture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Laleh's arms-opening gesture reweights the plaza's meaning from "grave" to "cradle" with conceptual cost (renaming under collective witness). One notable weakness: the tessera's sudden "blazing" and the city's atmospheric shift feel coincidental rather than causally linked to Laleh's precise words, slightly weakening closure necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: scattered performance timelines compress toward "one true encore," charged by recurring images (coin, fountain, orchard light). Orientation anchors arrive early (maze, orchard, Marcel's identity by paragraph four). The closure moment—Marcel's "let us try again" and the collaborative Wheel-turning—lands on the page as Charged Poise: options crystallize (intertwine timelines vs. continued fragmentation) with conceptual cost implicit in the phrase "try again" after prior failure. One friction: the cost remains atmospheric rather than specified; we see no foreclosed alternative or visible price in the final image, only the promise of renewed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory threads (static, light lines, geode warmth) toward a final reconfiguration where Eli "redirects" memory-pain into a tool. Orientation anchors cleanly (studio, post-shock, Eli+Naya present). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the "cursed souvenir" reweighted as compass), but the cost—what Eli loses or forecloses by choosing to guide rather than carry echoes—remains oblique; the final image asserts relief without showing the trade-off that makes the shift undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory traces (villagers' anxiety → children's sorrow → spiral pattern of the unknown) culminating in Charged Poise when Iri floats and speaks the "first map for two worlds." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (coastal cave, post-hibernation, Iri walking). The closure reweights the mapping mission from archival duty to interspecies dialogue, with the conceptual cost legible in Iri's shift from recorder to supplicant. One meaningful deepening occurs when the spiral pattern repeats, narrowing Iri's interpretation from residue to active presence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, amber warehouse beneath cliffs, "the night the cliffs finally stopped humming") land within the opening lines. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: silence → dust constellations → button pattern → jar unsealed → echo spilling through aisles builds density and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (prophecy as singular decree vs. "tangled invitation"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara tips the jar wider, seeding "new, unearthed silence, and endless raw possibility" with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "as the truth unravels above"—the Council's order will fracture. One meaningful deepening (button map → jar → release) is sufficient at this length. Causality remains clean under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered imagery (fog, pillbox, snow-code, twin pillbox) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias shifts from extraction/revenge to "ordinary rooms Mara's key might one day unlock," crystallizing a new stance with felt cost—he forgoes immediate resolution and accepts waiting. The orientation anchors (Zephyr Bluff, fog, cliff edge) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the twin pillbox reweights Mara's absence from defection/burial to an invitation ("Fix what breaks"). Cost is legible in the decision to wait rather than act, forgoing the burned-spy's usual urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (fog, needle, palimpsest) and the ending's "spindrift serenity" reconfigures earlier vows of keeping. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the mother's plea is held against prior promises, and the coach crosses with that cost legible. Orientation anchors are present (coachman, fog-bound crossing, coach) within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother's whisper overrides earlier confessions. The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "those words try to overwrite every earlier vow" as the exact moment prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (potter, oasis, dusk) land cleanly in the opening. The piece accumulates pressure through layered observations of fractured timelines, building density via the lantern-glass revelations until the final act—placing clay and seeds at each hive—reweights the dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: "this circle of stubborn life would, in some timeline, swarm again" crystallizes the conditional future and the potter's acceptance of uncertainty. One persistent constraint (water scarcity, mentioned in "water itself was rarer than sleep") subtly shapes the gesture's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara steps back "finally certain that vulnerability can stand guard too," reweighting her protective impulse with a new image of openness. The cost is felt—she commits to exposure without guarantee of return. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The story operates under an Accumulative lens: the petal drop triggers a cascade of reflective beats that deepen her understanding of her father's work and her own gardening, culminating in the act of arranging light-scattering objects. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she wants "to reflect light into dark corners" and acts on it. Minor penalty for the amount of reflective material (roughly 40% of the text) that, while anchored in present stimuli, slightly flattens forward momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with the sundial ritual and reflection encounter deepening Lio's reframing of solitude into a craft. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio lifts the sundial, the library adjusts, and "isolation felt like raw material" reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost—solitude is no longer a sentence but a chosen practice. The orientation anchor (tidal library, eastern balcony, fourth morning) arrives clearly by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reflection warns "awakenings are brittle only if you refuse to move," prompting Lio's harbor decision. Cost is legible but oblique—Lio accepts永久 curator status and renounces the wish to resurrect extinct companions—yet the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (lotus temple, lily pond, post-storm) and the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (nest, thread, echoes, drops widening rings) that reweigh the protagonist's stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—writing the letter uncoils invisible knots, foreclosing the role of passive vessel with felt cost (the slackening is both relief and loss of protective distance). Causality is clean; the architect's commission and the protagonist's private archive converge purposefully. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the final image (mirror-stone, pages as blueprint and confession) charges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (university radio station, Mara, midnight shift) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: signal mapping over months, the tower-sale announcement, then tonight's interfering broadcast build density toward a Charged Poise closure. The final swell reconfigures the relationship—Mara shifts from interpreter to gambler—with felt cost (equipment risk, defiance of administration). One tightening deepens the stake sufficiently for this length. No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: compass fragment → hall selection → pedestal action → staircase reveal → descent decision. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the protagonist stands at threshold, cost legible ("every instinct clawing upward"), accepting transformation as price. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, moonrise, temple). One meaningful tightening occurs when wrong passage choice could "tighten until ribs protested"—the compass narrows options with felt stakes. Cost is visible in the final beat's physical and psychological surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—details and gestures accumulate toward a resonant final image. Orientation anchors (Jonas, quarry, mist, detective case) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure unit is Charged Poise: the stone slipping beyond the mist as Jonas completes the portrait's dignity, crystallizing his method and the case's open stakes with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (thirteen years, hollow file, the waiting itself) but not decisively paid on the page; the turn is more deepening than tightening. One meaningful intensification occurs when the ribbon's memory triggers the portrait and Jonas explains his exhibition theory to Rhea, narrowing his tactic from passive observation to active image-making.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora's act of tagging Tamar's data creates an unerasable presence that "corrects the future," and the cost is conceptual and social—she has embedded contraband into the institutional record, risking her position. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through stanzas, the coded verses, and the layered platform imagery, culminating in a cadence shift when she uploads Tamar's entry. The orientation is swift (station, Liora, second week by line 10). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coordinates match the current station, reweighting exile from theoretical to present threat. The final image—"the copper nail...warmed slowly against her heart"—charges prior material without stating a moral. Minor slip: the "reversible exile" revelation mid-story could have been signaled earlier to increase pressure across more beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the scaffold wrap settling and "every possible road collapsing into the one ahead" crystallizes options with felt cost (the fiddler's "luminous disbelief" now resolved into action). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening two sentences. The piece accumulates density through the glass flake's fragmented images, the bridge-song's layered memories, and the scaffold map's recomposition, culminating in a cadence shift when the hitchhiker steps into the headlights. Cost is legible: the fiddler plays "the apology he never voiced" and the hitchhiker accepts "as if a decision has finally chosen him," foreclosing the vanished/trapped alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with two temporal shards (the present visit and the startup's arc) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (abandoned circus train, post-investor walkaway). The final image—foreign bills arranged by the father's routes, now recognized as apologies—delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the inherited journey with undeniable cost (the company dead, the vision revealed as polished hunger). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bills shift from "stories" to "apologies," narrowing the protagonist's stance with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is inferred and held: the story builds through dream fragments, telegram evidence, star-chart overlay, and the revelation of the temple's ledger function. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (observatory, midnight, dream chronicler assignment). The closure—"I finally witnessed my own healing"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (a realization that reweights the protagonist's relationship to their work and dreams), but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what path is foreclosed or what specific tactic shifts in response to this understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page with cost: Arlen's confession cracks the ice and reverses the magician's frozen words, reconfiguring the premise of what failed and who is culpable. Drive lens is Causal with lyric accumulation; the orchard vortex tightens in response to his expanding circles, and the seed's hunger provides the mechanism that locked the original confession. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex responds and the seed surfaces, narrowing options to confession. The cost is legible: admitting agency breaks the suspended state but implicates Arlen in the transformation of "nothing" into "everything."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: root-bound visionary in cobalt glade waiting for Lio. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure—the maze clipping's behavior, the vision sequence, and Lio's final realization build density and reweight the central question without strict causal linkage. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the final line crystallizes an impossible choice with undeniable pressure, reconfiguring the binary (cut/keep) into a tertiary stance that leaves cost visible even if not yet paid. The vision sequence deepens stakes by showing fracturing futures, and the cost is legible in Lio's shiver and the narrator's "terrible privilege."

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (catacomb orchard, Lio and narrator, present action). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (rust, pomegranates, roots trammeling bones) and the final beat reweights the premise—Lio as offering, not merchant—with visible cost (he looks older, narrator steadier). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's rearranged moments and Lio's dimming crystallize the bargain's price. One meaningful deepening via the protagonist's confession and the orchard's response. Minor deduction: the mechanics of the bargain (blood, language, light flare) feel somewhat formulaic and the final cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through interleaved memory and present appraisal until the grille-cloth scrap crystallizes recognition and forces the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli writes "Provenance uncertain, but history priceless to those who remember" and realizes "to discover purpose after loss was enough"—a stance crystallization that forecloses the purely factual path with felt cost (abandoning objective appraisal for subjective truth). Orientation anchors are present early (quarry trailer, Eli, auction appraisal). Cost is legible in the final choice to privilege personal history over commercial provenance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (arbor, seed, frozen wave) and the final act—Mara placing her palm against the trembling air to "reestablish what you have already taken"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost. The cost is legible: she forgoes the fame of witnessing alone and risks her own dissolution to restore the guide. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed is placed on the frozen wave and the arbor's pitch shifts, reweighting all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the fisherman squares his shoulders with "newly whole" weight, meets repetition with curiosity, and the final reflection-swap crystallizes the migrating-identity premise with visible cost (both characters exchange traits). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, the disappeared-tomorrow premise). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist opens the creel and must choose how to re-forge the fragments, narrowing from observation to active smelting. The "by accepting contradictions" method shapes the resolution. Cost is legible: the librarian's furnace gears intensify, the fisherman gains coherence by surrendering singular identity, and both wear each other's features in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, what) within the opening lines and holds a single continuous scene with clear spatial choreography. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (mirrored facets, etched confessions, the glowing pearl) and culminates in Mara's spoken fear, which reweights her professional stance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of "something in the human heart might also be quietly reopening" crystallizes a shift in her stance without requiring a decisive external act, and the conceptual cost—her implicit repudiation of her prior work—is felt. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern recurrence (river, coordinates, recorder/archive motifs) that culminate in a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (disused station, river, first-person chronicler). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the act of writing the brother's name in full and placing the narrator's own "on the same unsteady line" crystallizes options and reconfigures the archival practice with felt cost—moving from "content, not brother" to shared naming. The river's "ordinary wave...as if acknowledging receipt" completes the reweighting without resolving guilt, which sustains pressure. One deduction: the graffiti insight "YOU ARE NOT THE WORST THING" does much causal lifting but arrives only at the bathroom-scene midpoint; earlier priming would tighten the accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dusk, river fog, embankment). The closure—dissolving the resignation and choosing a single sentence over documentation—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she forecloses the mapmaker's path and accepts unresolved silence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes documentation would "misrepresent it entirely," reweighting her dominant stake from conquest to reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the protagonist's marginalia and the violin's crack crystallize a refusal with visible professional cost (lost grant, lost authentication) and conceptual cost (truth won't stand still for banners). The story teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (ice violin, coffee stains, plant gossip) and holds it through to the ending image where all three modes converge. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aurelio approaches with the contract, forcing the protagonist's hand; the margin-writing choice forecloses the authentication path with felt consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens early: Elara moves slab to slab, each ritual adding density and reweighting the grotto's charged atmosphere, building toward Isren's centrality. The closure—placing the chip on his sternum and the "single clear tone that rose like breath returning"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the threshold-of-stillness concept with undeniable pressure and felt cost (the chip is cracked, her identity bound to his). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (grotto, aurora, Elara's role), and the single-scene frame with embedded backstory fragments holds causality cleanly. One meaningful deepening (pivot from professional routine to personal reckoning) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (trees, smoke, scalloped motifs) and a cadence shift at the vision sequence reweights the dominant stake from seeking contentment-as-reward to accepting rotation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the hairpin splits open, the sapling rises, and the protagonist plants future help rather than claiming rest—with conceptual cost legible on the page (foregoing personal reward). Orientation anchors early (grotto, clouds, village below); the single POV and two-shard structure (village/climb → grotto interior) fit scope. One meaningful deepening occurs when touching the smoke column reveals cyclical lives, narrowing the protagonist's understanding and altering stance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—wind chimes, mirror shard, and dawn imagery build density toward a cadence shift at closure when "nuance itself had finally found a welcome perch." Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dawn, Mara) land by line 10. The escalation unfolds through the confession beat, which narrows Mara's certainty and reweights the dominant stake (absolution vs. sustained ambiguity). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Mara's shoulders loosen, signaling acceptance of unresolved grief, and the narrator's final image—"let the morning in, sharp and unsure"—charges the premise with felt cost (no clean heroism). One persistent constraint (the unerasable choice) shapes the ending image, lifting this into high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image crystallises Mora's choice between vanishing-as-fleeing and appearing-as-return, reweighting Elian's withholding with undeniable pressure ("the night held its breath, waiting for who she would choose to be"). Cost is felt in the "new hollow she had discovered inside" and legible in the grotto's "hidden pull" that will shape her future. Orientation is clean by ~100 words. Single POV, one scene, one dominant stake (learning to vanish without fleeing), one meaningful deepening through the stone-drop trance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered echoes, the flock's shifting pattern, and the arrowhead's "remembered direction." Orientation anchors (canyon, dusk, bone towers) arrive early. The closure—Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—lands on the page: "he finally knew where he was" reconfigures the wandering pulse into a coordinate system with conceptual cost (the surrender of physical journey). One meaningful deepening occurs when the skimmer realizes the pulse is "not his alone but the residue of countless choices never completed," which reweights his task and narrows his tactical options to stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density increase (archive → stair → platform → mist) and a cadence shift at closure reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise: stepping into mist crystallizes options (staying versus leaving, safety versus impossible boundary-work) with undeniable pressure and felt cost (abandoning the harness, the spire's mapped certainty). The cost is visible in the act itself—unstrapping, ascending the forgotten stair, stepping off solid ground—even though the outcome remains open. One meaningful tightening occurs when the keystone tugs him toward the unmapped stair, narrowing his path and raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layers of image (tag, library, luminous vows) build toward a final reconfiguration when Elias speaks his vow and the world "brightens." However, the closure unit lacks legible cost on the page—the library brightens, the tag clears, and Elias surfaces able to see sound-colors with no visible forfeit, struggle, or price paid. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows what he lost or risked to gain this ability. The orientation penalty is waived (clear early anchors), but the absent cost at closure prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (static bursts thickening, backwards prophecy arriving inverted) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the protagonist places hands on the tuning dials and chooses to "wavelength align with purpose already latent within." The closure forecloses the path of randomness with visible cost—"to stop casting was to amputate my function"—and the final hum reweights the dominant stake. The backwards-prophecy directive "Do not cast again; the choice loops; step off the spiral" provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through each named fear crystallizing into a shard, culminating in the reaper's hope for the boy—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where his ongoing witness forecloses the harvesting path with visible cost. Orientation anchors (observatory, dusk, retired reaper) arrive early. One tightening—the ritual repeated "again and again"—deepens the dominant stake (naming to translate sacrifice's echo). Cost is felt in "tenderness he barely recognized" and the endless vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through lyric density—drip rates, cosmic imbalance, brittle faith—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Tamsin perceives the ocean's tilt and lets the bell ring, crystallizing her devotion's cost without full resolution on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Tamsin, viaduct, dawn, broken bell). The escalation is a deepening rather than causal reversal: her peculiar gift (drip sensing) aligns drops and reveals systemic delay, then she acts. Cost is felt ("whatever you were meant to tell the sea, you also tell me") but the final image's consequences remain oblique—pressure is undeniable, yet the "letting it ring" lacks a concrete sensory payoff that would anchor full closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors (Tomas, ridgeway, twilight, after wind chime falls silent) land within the first paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the photograph trail deepens through density increase and pattern break, reweighting Tomas's engineer stance toward storyteller. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): he holds up photographs and "began…with a story," crystallizing a new stance with undeniable pressure—the council will demand reports, neighbors wait in silence, and his choice forecloses his prior engineer-only mode. Cost is felt in the mirrored hush and the fragility of their listening. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (prismatic light, breathing orchard, equations as branches) and holds it through the closure, where the crystal cracks into petals and Elian's gaze shifts. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the transformation promised is redefined as perceptual rather than alchemical) with felt cost: tears become lenses, and decades of proof-seeking are renounced. The orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One tightening occurs when Elian abandons calculation for shared rhythm, narrowing his method and forecloses the path of forced certainty. Cost is legible in "felt the touch of wonder settle into him" paired with tears, though the conceptual price could land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Situational lens holds cleanly: coherent pressure from the intercepted message forces stance crystallization through the protagonist's judgment call. Orientation anchors (arbor, clouds, cities below) establish by the opening paragraph. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the decision to file the report reconfigures the trust/betrayal stakes with felt cost ("stone dropped into an unseen sea"), and the final image of climbing down past lightning scars charges the near-miss with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening when the static clears and coordinates unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric texture. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, two Arins, brain jar, arbiter Kesh) land cleanly in the opening third. The memory-duel escalates through a series of because/therefore beats: each blade swing threatens erasure, the narrator's defensive choices spark feeling, and the final refusal to erase guilt prevents monstrosity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator lowers the weapon and voices understanding, crystallizing a stance that forecloses the path of hollowing-out with visible relational and moral cost. The cost is legible in the line "whatever we vivify from the jar will be monstrous and numb," reweighting the custody question into an ethical recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds density through layered images (hourglass, tunnel breath, egg timer, half-laugh unfinished chord) and resolves via Resonant Reconfiguration when phantom laughter streams upward and the parents' rusted laughs crack open. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (Lysander, tunnel under old house, after the hourglass). Closure cost is felt—"something fragile has cracked open instead of sealing shut"—and the final warm pull-cord handle holds the shape of a smile, reweighting prior grief with charged poise. One minor seam: the transition from Lysander's performance to the parents' response skips the causal middle step of how exactly the sound becomes laughter rather than noise.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (frozen garden, narrator awake, guardian watching) land early. The piece accumulates pressure through layered metaphors (shelves rearranging world, boundaries of light, fog as uncertainty) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's "walk while waiting" stance crystallizes a friendship with uncertainty, and the guardian's gift of the pendant reconfigures the threshold from locked to provisional. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of certainty and the acceptance of perpetual liminality, legible in "waiting, uncertain, almost kind."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements; the piece builds density through layered reflection and image until the crozier-shattering act reconfigures the stakes. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the redirection of institutional blessings toward "unchosen paths" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (authority collapsing "with the exhausted sigh of a cathedral exhaling"). Orientation anchors at twilight, ember nexus, Corren by ~80 words; one meaningful deepening when he moves from observation to theft to ritual transformation. Cost is legible: wardens "shivered and straightened, eyes wet," and Corren carries "only the knowledge that tomorrow, someone would quietly choose otherwise"—a cost to inevitability itself, consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (signal interpreter), where (tower city over gorge), and when (lunar perigee night) by the second paragraph. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she teaches the towers to imagine gradual ending rather than catastrophic fall, a compromise that forecloses immediate destruction with visible cost ("decades, I promised"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increase (emergency codes, love songs, weather reports) and cadence shift ("sighing dial tone") reweighting the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the city's wish to fall threatens valley lives, narrowing her options to redirect or deny.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are established early (deckhand, Harbor Line 7, bay crossing). The piece accumulates pressure through the radio melody, the grotto's appearance, and the overlapping ferries, culminating in "He chose home"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. However, the cost remains implicit; we cannot point to an exact line where the price of this choice is legible, only inferred from context. One meaningful deepening is present when the grotto opens and reveals all journeys at once, reweighting the vanishing-ferry premise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly: single POV, architect meeting, gallery descent. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure: the thread-weaving process deepens through density increase and pattern layering until the final image reconfigures the grief-work into a charged poise between stepping through and staying. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): wrapping the thread around the doorway crystallizes options with felt cost—neither resolution nor flight, but an active suspension. One meaningful deepening through weaving suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening sentence (benthic city, numbers-as-stars). Pressure accumulates through layered images—alien spires, translated sky, lines of absence—and crystallizes in the final stanza when the narrator commits to reading edges "as I once read waves." The closure is Charged Poise: the protagonist stands "between worlds, quietly astonished," with the conceptual cost legible (abandoning surface certainty for an abyss curriculum whose horizon remains unknown). One tightening deepening occurs when Mirror dims the viewport and reveals edge geometry, reweighting all prior navigation stakes. Causality holds under the accumulative lens; no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through a pattern of echoes (the hearing aid's ticks, Lale's unsent attempts, the "reeling hush") that converges at closure when Eren delivers the message. Orientation anchors are clear by ~100 words (Eren, atrium, twilight, contact tracer). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eren's choice to call forecloses the bureaucratic path and crystallizes his stance as someone who "could not fix anything, only tilt it." Cost is felt in his violation of protocol and the weight of the woman's cry. One meaningful deepening—from buzzing signal to delivered plea—reweights the dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) with undeniable pressure at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Noah turns for the exit with the sphere "whispering of return," crystallizing the choice between payday and witness with undeniable pressure and felt cost. The causal lens holds cleanly—discovery of the codex leads to the thread, thread leads to the sphere, sphere's properties trigger the choice—and orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first few paragraphs. One tightening occurs when the rig translates the gold fleck into a guiding thread, narrowing Noah's options and pulling him deeper; the tidal clock adds a second pressure layer. The cost is legible in the final image: he exits but the sphere's whisper charges his departure with renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural texture (spilled ink pattern as discovery mechanism). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist abandons linear reconstruction for nonlinear synthesis, Lian's fragmented voice emerges, and the final realization reweights the entire reconstruction project with visible cost—he cannot restore her as she was. The ink-pattern epiphany motivates the algorithmic pivot cleanly. One meaningful tightening: the narrator's method shifts from sector-by-sector rebuilding to sideways iteration, narrowing his options and raising the stakes of this final night.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds pressure through sensory layering and the gradual alignment of diamond, echoes, birds, and voice. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR): the protagonist accepts the curse and sings a new language woven from accumulated elements, a stance crystallization with conceptual cost ("his own voice was being braided"). Orientation is clear (canyon, dusk, tunnel entrance) by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond reveals the canyon's lost language, and the final image reweights the premise. The cost is felt but not sharply dramatized—acceptance rather than visible forfeiture—which keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation clearly (researcher in underground garden) and maintains Accumulative/Textural pressure through layered sensory detail and mounting revelations. However, closure is weak: the final sentence introduces "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" as a thematic tag without dramatizing what bitterness is being turned, what work is required, or what cost the narrator accepts. The Conceptual Repricing needed to land this ending is asserted rather than made legible through a final image that reweights prior material. The accumulation is strong, but the closure unit fails to deliver felt or conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. Orientation anchors (violinist, sky-bridge, dusk) arrive early. The escalation unfolds through density increase—locust shell touch → world thinning → orchard pulse → matching rhythm → roots breaking—culminating in Lio stepping onto the rising bough. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the world remaking itself with Lio carried upward, options reconfigured, cost implicit in the city's darkened collapse and his departure from the bridge. One causal seam: the locust shell's arrival and function feel convenient rather than prepared, and the orchard's ability to "speak" through heart rhythms lacks prior setup, reducing earned causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece weaves absence-mapping, the storm-bottle delivery, and thematic imagery toward a Charged Poise closure where Mara holds the bottle and articulates the storm's promise while Eren voices the risk—options are crystallized and meaning reweighted without a decisive act. Orientation anchors (disputed territory, arcade, twilight mail drop) land early. The tightening is modest: Eren walks, delivers, they discuss; pressure accumulates through description and dialogue rather than a causal narrowing of options, which keeps this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Eli, abandoned circus train, present exploration) land cleanly within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density (dust → gleam → song → restoration) and cadence shifts that reweight silence from emptiness to generative possibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the new stance—working "in the new understanding that every revolution begins in the smallest circle of silence"—with felt cost (abandoning salvage-only mode for commitment to creation). Causality is clean: discovery → touch → song → motion → understanding → action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered mapping, star-marked pauses, and the poet's arrival; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise (stories live in "posture of attention" rather than physical location). Orientation anchors (who: Mariel; where: library; when: dusk→midnight) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The poet's walk to the "unremarkable junction" provides one meaningful tightening when "the air fold[s] inward," and the final image redefines Mariel's elaborate project with felt cost (all her diagrams collapse into "this simple observation"). The causal chain from mapping→following→realization holds under the accumulative lens, though the conceptual cost—years of late shifts, secret work, tattered scarf as emblem—remains somewhat oblique rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (island, librarian, jars). The closure image—sunrise fixing the jars with "indelible, tender clarity"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the hunt for the runaway dream. However, cost remains implicit and abstract; no on-page sentence makes legible what Irena forfeits or gains in that final pour of light, weakening closure proof.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (viaduct, twilight, locksmith's threadbare coat). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the vial's uncorking triggers a pressure-release that reweights the protagonist's stance toward fear. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—thanking fear and asking it to step aside crystallizes a new relationship with the trapped idea, and the cost is felt as the protagonist shifts from guarding to releasing. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it through the ending. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locksmith uncorks the vial and the "pressure" unfurls, altering the protagonist's internal stance. Minor deduction: the cost at closure is atmospheric and emotional but not entirely legible as a foreclosed path or concrete sacrifice on the page, keeping this below 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through closure. The final image—"decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes, yet for the first time my own story felt unswervingly mine"—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost: facts thinning, dates dissolving in exchange for completeness. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (drowned bay, decades later, former folklorist). The mushroom-constellation map at midpoint provides one meaningful deepening that narrows options and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The opening establishes reversible exile as the dominant stake; the tea-leaf reading deepens it; Rhea's vow to hold the exit open and Jun's demand that forgetting hurt crystallize a Charged Poise closure with felt cost (the promise binds both). Orientation anchors quickly (forgotten library, Council decree, mirror wall). One meaningful tightening through Rhea's refusal converts Council punishment into fragile hope. Cost is visible: Rhea guarantees pain, Jun enters exile.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (orchard, waterfall, spring, narrator seeking work). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (ghosts in branches, colors gathering, orchard expanding into city and stars) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator "planted my first true hope"—the hush "no longer empty, but waiting" reweights the opening gray collapse. Cost is felt but oblique: the narrator's fear and the city's grayness are acknowledged, yet the final image leans toward affirmation without a clear forfeiture or friction that would sharpen the price of this transformation. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The escalation unfolds through knot-by-knot accumulation, each releasing a voice or memory, building density until the final name spills out and the spirits settle—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Ilan's ritual forecloses wandering with visible cost (he carries the secret briefly, then releases it). One meaningful deepening occurs when the second knot releases a voice and Ilan commits ("I will hold what you cannot"), reweighting his role from passive restorer to active vessel. Cost is legible in the final image: the interlaced hush shifts from unrest to grounded stillness, and his future work is reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (map tear, video reels, frescoes, the woman's aging) and the closure reconfigures Elias's stance from interrogator to advocate for listening. Orientation anchors (museum basement, viewing room, video footage) arrive promptly. The cost, however, is conceptual and oblique—Elias recommends reopening but we do not see what he risks or forecloses by that choice. The closure image ("only as a place to listen") reweights prior material but lacks the felt price or trade-off that would lift this into the 8+ band under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (diver, coordinates, wreck site) and the accumulative lens holds: discovery of library → snow globes → skeleton → cylinder → decompression chamber → choice. Closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost legible on the page: "a compromise that felt like mourning" directly names the foreclosed paths (raising only the cylinder vs. salvaging everything) and the undeniable pressure of honoring the physicist's experiment. The cost is felt even though the exact action is withheld, meeting RR standards. One micro-deduction: the Amelia Earhart frame bookends neatly but doesn't constrain the middle beats as tightly as the snow-globe logic does.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (graffiti, mist, copper dust circuits) and culminates in a cadence shift when plain words replace secret sigils, reweighting the stake (unspoken needs → articulated confessions). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the courtyard becomes a public choir with visible transformation: "I AM LONELY... PLEASE STAY"), and the cost is legible—Lio's private encoding becomes exposed, the city "sighs in relief," and his隐蔽 role ends. One minor gap: the ghost's sudden agency (petals peeling, rearranging) lacks prior mechanical hints, creating a small motivational leap, but the accumulative design absorbs it without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear causal linkage: Etta's decision to steal the key enables the climb, the goggles enable decryption, the diary's method alters her interpretive stance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she returns "an ascending one, eyes tuned to the joy beneath anguish," reweighting her servant role with visible conceptual cost—she cannot steal the diary but must carry its invisible interpretive burden. Orientation anchors are clean by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the encryption reveals itself as annotation rather than concealment, narrowing her understanding and transforming her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held throughout. Orientation anchors (Mara, gondola, post-accident drift) land within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Mara's realization that "the sky remembers everything we once believed would fall and vanish" crystallizes her stance with felt cost (she accepts the drift rather than demanding rescue). The cost is conceptual and emotional: she memorializes through surrender rather than data alone. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gondola begins moving along remembered flight paths, transforming her hypothesis into visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, tree library, demolition morning) land cleanly in the opening lines. Pressure accumulates through layered backstory (guild commission, ceilings, masters gone, condemnation) and tightens in the final painting act where spatial constraint forces the realization that "some limits were not failures but frames." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the boards "seemed ready to warp" and she stops "not because the painting was finished, but because there was no more space," reweighting her disability and art practice with conceptual cost. The demolition countdown horns bracket the painting beats and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the hopscotch observation pattern until the final choreographed sequence. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the corridor of "clear, waiting sky" crystallizes the stake with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains poised rather than paid on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (airship, apprentice, dusk) within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio overlays coordinates onto the hopscotch sequence, narrowing options from idle observation to actionable navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who, what, and where early (lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen library, morning ascent). Escalation proceeds through density layering—prophecy scraps → gear-mirror interactions → sequential mirror unlockings—culminating in the library's thaw. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the thaw reweights the opening frost and repairs the broken rhythm), but cost remains atmospheric rather than foregrounded in a decisive image or forfeiture; the final line gestures at transformation without a sharp before/after pivot that charges the ending with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (strangers→family, dead learning to walk, Kerran organizing routes), transitions via the bell's ringing and quake intensification, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the survivors stand together on the surviving span, orchard intact, bell shattered—gratitude and grief braided with visible cost (lost heirlooms, collapsed arch, shattered bell). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the fourth paragraph ("Our settlement clung to one particularly low arch"). The cost is legible: "No one screamed; they were too busy counting who had made it across, calling each name like a prayer." One meaningful deepening occurs when the northern orchards begin to fall and Kerran's chalk messages shift from planning to urgent command ("Move now"), narrowing options and raising stakes under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the lighthouse and adjuster role are clear. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the adjuster tilts moments across nested patterns, the clock dims, and he sits beside the puppet as "the world did not end all at once"—a visible conceptual repricing with cost (universal salvation abandoned for gentler mercy). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern intensify through nested chambers, cadence shifts at "He understood then," and the final image reweights the stake. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length. The cost is legible in "no triumph, only bruised awe at the vastness of what would still be lost," though the phrase borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (orchard, cliff, narrator who survived a fall). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated guidance choices, frost traces of unchosen paths, and the birds' tightening spirals. Closure is Charged Poise / Conceptual Repricing hybrid: the stranger arrives seeking the blueprint itself; the nut burns, trees shift, and the narrator understands "the blueprint wanted to be remembered, and that guiding him might finally free the orchard from me." Cost is felt (potential release after years of defiance) and conceptual (blueprint as living presence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the girl's path assembles and the narrator sees "what the old caretaker had meant." Causality holds; ellipses are motivated by years passing. The ending crystallizes stakes without resolving them on the page, which fits Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through foam-pattern study, resin redesign, and evening walks until the prototype's success delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: guilt loosening into "something more spacious"). Orientation is clear by paragraph four. Cost is legible: she carries the chrysalis to the ravine, holding grief's transformation rather than erasing it. One micro slip: the station director's congratulation beat feels like a planted contrast rather than organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with late Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchors (glass orchard library, cloud sea, vendor waking that morning) arrive early. The closure—vendor's name inked under "Beginnings," shifting from blank to margin—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights his role; the woman signs her name, accepting fractures with visible cost (writing slowly, "mindfully scattered yet connected"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the slate reveals carved absences instead of clearing, forcing both to confront omitted paths. The cost is felt: she steps into awareness of fractures, he finds his entry in the catalog. Lens holds; closure lands on the page with conceptual and relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory and conceptual density around stored remorse, peaks in the coral pavilion descent, and closes with a cadence shift—the garrison's softened faces and Rafi's return to sleep—that reweights the opening dream motif with felt cost (he still tastes the day, the fortress cycles uneasily). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The tidal pool → cracked tile → pavilion descent → tasting shards → evening stew sequence is causally motivated and tightens pressure through the soldier's shard rejection, then releases into the meal's quiet effect. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Rafi endures his role, the cost legible in "taste of the day still on his tongue" and the fortress's ongoing cycle. One meaningful deepening (the soldier's shard) narrows his agency and charges the final image. Deduction: the ending's reconfiguration is more atmospheric than decisively felt; the before/after is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear pattern: isolation → connection through shared language and rehabilitation. Closure arrives on-page when "the city finally heard itself as one body" through the rehabilitated structure, a Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts from hoarding to flow. Cost is primarily conceptual (weeks of labor, coordinated effort) rather than viscerally felt; the final image reweights prior "borrowed starlight" and mechanical metaphors effectively. One meaningful deepening occurs when volunteers descend and the elevator "laughed," transforming its voice from confession to participation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines and sustains a single continuous scene with clear causal linkage: Lio triggers the device → reverie floods in → he adjusts the periscope toward his own reflection → filaments reshape connections → memories slot into him → canyon calms. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he accepts the role of living archive, foreclosing detached observation, with felt cost legible in the tears and the "weight of finally belonging." Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density increases through braided memories and the final image reweights the stake. The canyon's calming and the collage of gazes in the mirror charge the ending without requiring a decisive external act.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (archivist, eastern wall, monthly gravity inversion). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers threshold crossings, symbolic arrangements, and atmospheric density until the final codex moment reconfigures the archivist's memory with "newly nested combinations." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he reads the arrangements, gains the knowledge, and returns, foreclosing the option to remain ignorant; cost is conceptual (he now bears "watchful stars" of responsibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when the chains dissolve, granting access. Minor causality smoothness: the chains' logic (tasting "tempered fire") is asserted rather than tested on-page, but the lens holds and closure lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through Lio's history with the sculpture, the grove's instrumentation, and the shared strumming that triggers collective motion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grove moves as one, "new music continues inside every moving body," and Lio feels the pulse "between his ribs." Cost is present (exhaustion, sinking to the ground) but felt rather than decisive. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the hedgehog's uncurling (~line 3), satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the copper trembles through soil and the grove responds, reweighting the dominant stake (creating music) with visible empathy-in-motion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors (who, where, when) land by line 3; the nexus hum and covenant pulses accumulate density through pattern breaks (magnetic alignment, silence-translation) that reweight Oren's stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Oren's whispered prayer and the covenant's shift position him differently with felt cost ("neither condemned nor absolved, only positioned differently"), and the deepened dent materializes future pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when he maps the pulses onto a chessboard and realizes his exile was a legal move in a long game, narrowing his options to gentle reshaping rather than outright cancellation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a hybrid lens—accumulative texture (cataloging silences) resolving into a causal turn (the decision to unclasp). Closure is a Decisive Change: Elias physically unclasps the diary after the realization reweights his understanding of Mira's choice, foreclosing his years-long avoidance with visible cost (confronting the echo of his shout and her unread words). The rocket's "brief white glare" charges the final image. One structural friction: the reflective density in the middle third risks flattening present pressure, though the countdown and sound-work maintain situational urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph (Liora, treetop village, dawn) and establishes the dominant stake clearly by line 10 (elders' vote on descent; Liora's seed as answer). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of imagery and motifs (rot/death, swaying/serenity, journals/intentionality) until the final planting reweights those terms. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the village inhales to listen, options crystallize, and cost is felt in Liora's "fragile serenity growing inside the motion" and the elders' surrender. The cost is visible in Maru's nod ("surrender to something older than his caution") and the requirement that watchers accompany her, foregrounding accountability. One escalation step—Maru's initial challenge → Liora's argument → permission with watchers—narrows options cleanly. No causality breaks or lens contradictions touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors smoothly by the opening lines (orchard planet, gravity inversion, Lio the pilot). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through escalating sensory density (dust lifts, apples sail, water erupts moss, droplets carry memories) and culminates in the arrow's conceptual reveal. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the arrow as "seed of intention" reweights the planet's resilience as defiant will encoded in water and stone—but the cost remains oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price unmistakable. The lens holds, yet the final image lacks the sharp sting of consequence that would elevate it into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the investigator's methodical survey, wind-pattern documentation, and the spiraling realization that "air in cities is as capricious as crowds." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"foresight could be trained, one meticulous breath at a time"—reweighting the premise with the cost of the flight engineer's death made undeniable by the frayed patch. One tightening deepens stakes: the model "refused to resolve" until the investigator walks the path and catalogs the invisible forces. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and conceptual weight toward a single release moment that reweights the premise ("wonder stood undeniable"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell's release and the shared breath between sculptor and ringer crystallize the dominant stake with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Causality is clean within the accumulative frame; the sculptor's distant blow triggers Ilen's act as promised.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to present stimuli (the flute, the wind, the amphitheater), building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in which Cael's realization—"he had treated the instrument as a doorway, never as a listener"—reweights his entire guardianship. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he offers an imperfect note "not to bridge worlds...but simply to offer a sound," forecloses the old duty-driven path, and opens an internal one with felt cost. Orientation anchors early (mountains, streambed, amphitheater). One small tension: the "weave between worlds" premise operates more as metaphor than on-page mechanism, slightly blurring whether the flute's silence was mystical or mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator stands inside the printed geometry, experiences transposed empathy, and returns with reweighted grief—"its variables stolen and returned in unfamiliar order." Cost is visible: the old grief becomes trivial, a conceptual price that forecloses the tidy narrative. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (topaz type, halo fragment, geometry), and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator presses the lever and the geometry manifests, narrowing the emotional equation from abstract to embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The aurora encounter deepens understanding through layered reflection anchored to the pendant's vibration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: accepting slower time with cost to prior velocity). Orientation is clean by line 1; the pendant's behavior change provides the meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the renunciation of "rushing" and the commitment to extend encounters despite occupational loss. One seam: "germinate stories in the people who touched them" arrives as authorial summary rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—layered perception, sensory communion—and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (Maple Street, quarry, blue sedan) land by ~15% and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes the stance of "truthful lies," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (proof remains subjective, belief cannot be mechanized). One meaningful deepening occurs at the frost-reading beat, where the prism refracts "colors never named" and the protagonist acknowledges that "no instrument but myself" can record it. Cost is felt in the acknowledgment that science will ask for numbers he cannot provide, yet he proceeds door to door, embedding the price in each visit.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal escalation at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The puzzle assembles through motivated beats (trade → assembly → understanding its cost → sacrifice → breath exhaled), and the final image of "distant footsteps turned, as if hearing" lands as Charged Poise with felt cost—the tapestry unmade, the loom "bare and skeletal." One meaningful deepening that narrows options with visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is secure within the first paragraph (orchard planet, blacksmith, cobalt pears). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through stacking images (calcifying orchards, sinking arches, hollow stares) and culminates in the underground lattice moment where Corren's gathered hopes reshape stone into flexible steps—a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost ("wire strung tight between earth and sky"). The closure lands on the page and reweights the opening's "azure defiance." One slip: the middle section (mine descent, silk divination) reads more as patient explanation than escalating pressure, slightly flattening momentum before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (overlapping realities, cyclical pattern) and holds it through closure. The corridor-of-selves moment provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lio "cuts loose the binding threads," and the final image—"a pattern that, for once, belonged only to this single world"—charges the ending with conceptual cost (foreclosing repetition). Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph. The weakness: the middle relies heavily on exposition about cycles rather than on-page pressure that narrows options, and the shard's mechanics remain vague until the climax, limiting causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers letters, stones, and sea glass through a single continuous lantern-room visit, building density toward the final act of writing and stone-scuffing that reweights Elias's role from carrier to keeper. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): he commits to answer future messages, foreclosing his observer distance with the cost legible in "I am only the one who comes and goes…but I will answer." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening—discovery of the letter chain—tightens the stake from delivery task to communal protection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Orrin accepts the lighthouse's invitation and aims "hoarded shadows into the waiting sky," crystallizing his decades-old oath with visible cost—abandoning the dead shipping lanes for "unused futures." The Accumulative lens holds: the hum, reflections straightening into his own handwriting, and the fermented promise build density until the beam thickens and invites. Orientation anchors quickly (Orrin, emerald lighthouse, night the last newspaper died). One meaningful deepening when the lighthouse "had been listening the whole time" reweights all prior tending. Cost is conceptual but legible: steering a new dawn replaces the lost mornings of shared print.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through the three patron encounters and a cadence shift in the wing-reveal beat. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the realization "they were not magnets for stories but mirrors for longing") that reweights the protagonist's quest, and the final image—bowing as "strangers becoming luminous"—charges prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt (the protagonist's earlier framework is dismantled), though the price could be more visceral; the ending reweights but does not foreclose a live option with on-page consequence, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The sextant falling → Milo climbing → moonlight healing → mapping dreams → recording forgiveness forms a coherent tightening under accumulative logic. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Milo recording witnessed sorrow "bent quietly toward forgiveness" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he now bears the weight of all those layered memories. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sextant begins mapping scattered dreams, narrowing his task to patient node-by-node deconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (glass roots, pear trees with trapped sunsets, mica window) and the ending shifts cadence as memories "fly home" and dawn unfurls from the people themselves. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the final image where the realm "shudders under the sudden honesty" with cost visible in that shudder and the vanishing satchel weight. The accumulative pressure is consistent, but the causal link between Mara touching the shard to the window and the subsequent broadcast through fractures could be tighter; the mechanics feel slightly gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Harrow Street, night custodian, ten o'clock close) land cleanly. The nested reveals—janitor discovers hidden library, Mara appears off-schedule, gray volume bears brother's name—accumulate density and the voicemail's reframing constitutes a conceptual repricing with felt cost (his brother trusted him; Elias had filled the silence with imagined recriminations). The closure image ("began at last to stay") reweights the "staying while leaving" contradiction. Minor causality slip: Mara's arrival "merely an ordinary Thursday" violates the stated solstice rule without dramatized consequence, a convenience that slightly weakens world-rule consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The story coheres around Elias's attempt to resolve his complicity by witnessing the bread in the tea house; the tea mistress's gentle interrogation forces him to confront whether noticing is action. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture" crystallizes his stance with felt cost—the bread is consumed, the bakery remains gone, and he accepts the limit of his agency. The final image of warmth rising "slowly, defiantly" recharges the dominant stake without tidy resolution. Orientation is clean by line 2 (Elias, courtyard, post-migration timeframe). Cost is legible on the page: he eats the bread without miracle, foreclosing the fantasy of earned forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when cleanly within the opening lines. The causal lens holds: alarm → vault entry → slide diagnosis → vow reconstruction → amended vow → stabilization, each because/therefore link motivated. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Serin braids his vow into the founders' with visible cost—risking ancient equations—and the graphs level into a "slow, sustainable pulse," reweighting obligation versus erasure with felt price. One meaningful tightening (decay accelerates; comprehension lends weight) narrows options and the final act forecloses mere preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers density through layered sensory detail, backstory fragments, and market atmosphere, culminating in a charged final image where Loretta's "unease settled beside her like company she had chosen." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Loretta chooses to remain and listen, forgoing return and accepting estrangement as visible cost. One minor slip: the watch fob's mechanics ("thwarts the greedy through false starts") are told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the causal texture of the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, sensory-accumulation pattern early (taste shifts, aurora descriptions, forest parliament) and sustains it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist stands with the weather-bearers under a dimming aurora, four bodies carrying "the weather of a larger tomorrow"—options crystallize, cost is felt (volunteering the body as meeting place), and prior material reweights. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lavender bluff, aurora, narrator present). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ring melts into skin and the weather-bearers explain their archive burden. The final image reconfigures the skeptic's stance with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through descent → self-portrait reveal → completion of Mara's eyes → re-locking, with the broken lock serving as a recurring constraint that reweights at closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias answers the calling and then re-seals it, forecloses the path of suppression with visible cost ("sits until the crystals pale"). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line 4. One meaningful deepening occurs when he draws her eyes and realizes he has "simply answered what was always waiting," narrowing his options from evasion to acceptance-then-containment. Cost is legible in the final image: he completes the forbidden portrait yet imprisons it again, a paradox that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, when) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the map assembly functions as a density increase that reweights the dominant stake (finding lost conversations). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lio steps inside, doors exhale the city's unsaid truths, and the cost is felt as atmospheric pressure rather than paid in a decisive act. The zinc plate's recognition mechanism at the gate provides a subtle causal turn. One meaningful deepening is present, but the final image charges without a visible forfeiture, placing it solidly in the 7s under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—the sculpture's ongoing song preserves wonder's color through kinetic truth-telling. Cost is conceptual and felt: wonder becomes an impersonal, transient light rather than something owned, and Lio's voice is surrendered seasonally. The single-shard structure (girl arrives, shard installed, sculpture sings) provides one meaningful deepening; escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The Charged Poise at closure—sculpture continuing after participants leave—reweights the premise with undeniable pressure, though the cost is oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—walking rows, tracing dust, linking memories—and escalates through density increase and cadence shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the android seals the crate after the burn, accepting miniaturized fears on an inner shelf with visible cost ("no longer for the pristine early days"). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the fourth line ("android caretaker," "desert rose farm," "glass-domed enclosure," geomagnetic tremor context). One meaningful deepening occurs when he reroutes power and triggers the partition burn, reweighting his internal architecture and the dome ecology together.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the dawn circles gather fragments that coalesce into the mailbox's history, and the closure lands when the document is revealed and validated. Orientation anchors (Mara, thrift store, courtyard, dawn) arrive early. The escalation—from locket arrival to circle assembly to collective reconstruction to physical opening—maintains coherent pressure. However, the final beat ("when the city clerk confirmed the document and the developers backed away") occurs off-page in summary, and the cost is distributed across the community rather than focused on Mara, diffusing the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation early (sunken lab, protagonist's role) and builds pressure through the hangman's dice sequence, journal discovery, and final server manipulation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the sunken laboratory no longer felt like a tomb, but like a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen." The cost is conceptual—the lab transformed from tomb to hidden heart—but the exact on-page sentence making that cost undeniable is the protagonist's coded addition that teaches surveillance routines "into open channels." One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the true project had never been the lab" but teaching the building to listen. Slight lens ambiguity in the middle (causal detective work vs. accumulative atmosphere) resolves by the end under accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the narrator sees "missing days circling like stunned fish" in the thickened air above the coffee-ground spirals, crystallizing the exhumation method with conceptual cost (committing to the father's discredited practice). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (lantern failures, crystal pulses, memory lapses) builds to the final cadence shift when grounds cling to crystal and reveal the lost fragments. Orientation anchors quickly (dock-side lantern lighter, harbor, night after the whale). One tightening: the notebook constellation insight ("what he had read was never weather, but the shifting gravity of forgetting") narrows the search to a spatial metaphor the ending then literalizes. The cost is felt in the narrator's isolation and the eerie hum closing the story.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise—the prophecy is hushed, the valley relaxes, and the cost ("weight added to his bones") is legible in the final breath. Orientation anchors early (valley, brook, Ilen). The piece accumulates density through interleaved image and action (crane placement, chant, faraway visions, erasure) and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening: the coded threat loses its tongue. Cost is visible and closure is coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens that holds through closure. The escalation builds through weekly sessions to the meteor-shower night when the building "speaks plainly," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator realizes learning means "carry[ing] their denials as gently as their truths"). Cost is legible: the protagonist must accept complicity in the building's "agreed upon lies" to continue living there. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the progression from sugar-borrowing to rooftop listening could compress slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens with accumulative texture: Neris finds the shell, hears the vision, seeks the caretaker, and receives instruction that reframes her relationship to guilt. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she moves from prisoner to archivist, a stance crystallization with felt cost ("did not forgive herself, not yet, but she began to map and archive"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the caretaker's question forces her to confront what she has been quarantining from herself, narrowing her options and leading to the final learning posture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (Irian, marble sanctuary, aurora night). Escalation proceeds through a meaningful tightening: Irian moves from altering decrees in secret to openly signing his own name, exposing all prior work. Sevran's discovery functions as a reversal that narrows options, then enables the final choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Irian signs "not as the king but as yourself," unlinking his name with visible cost (risk of execution, loss of anonymity). The cost is legible on the page in the line "each stroke no longer borrowed but born, imperfect yet wholly his."

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Liora's song elicits layered echoes that deepen from obvious to error to the fragile second line, culminating in a flood of voices that reweights her understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from blame to acceptance, from forcing answers to bearing witness) with felt emotional cost. Orientation is swift (canyon rim, night, Liora, her task) and the causal chain of song → echo → flood → insight is clean. The cost is legible: she releases the demand for her sister's full return and accepts fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (glacier shrine, Marek's role, candles). The piece commits to an accumulative/textural lens: dream-windows, recurring snow globe, and layered backstory build toward the woman's charged moment of recognition. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the woman's tears and Marek's prescription crystallize options with felt cost. However, the cost remains largely implied (future confession/unsealing) rather than legible in a decisive on-page action or sacrifice, and the midpoint dream-sequence relies on told summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The narrator's realization that "my quiet labor was part of a sky no one could quite ignore" crystallizes options and reweights the dominant stake (self-worth in hidden effort) with felt cost (accepting invisibility). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (canal, parapet, Ren). One meaningful deepening occurs when the droplet exercise makes the abstract concrete, and the final image charges prior material (fireflies, moon paths, whispering parapet) without stating a moral. Cost is legible in the acceptance of being "unseen" yet essential.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (letters → diamond → choice). Orientation anchors by line 3. The closure—Theo's refusal to deliver the diamond—is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the orchard may wither and survivors will choke. One tightening intensifies stakes when he recognizes the geometric scars link fruit to diamond, narrowing his options to custody or destruction. The "choose not to deliver it back" final line lands the change with felt cost, though "slowly choke" slightly softens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens throughout, building density through radio static, voice emergence, and storm imagery that converges at the portico stand. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Ilen stands beneath the cobalt glass as the voice pours through, the final image ("did not know if he was rising or falling, only that the dawn would remember this bargain") reconfiguring his mission with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One deduction: the cost is felt but slightly abstract; the final beat could land harder if a concrete sensory detail sharpened the consequence of standing there.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with strong causal backbone. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, dunes loft, dawn) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The music box discovery → woman's arrival → jar-braiding sequence accumulates density and narrows the poet's stance from passive collection to active translation; the final move toward town is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that forecloses pure isolation with felt opportunity cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's need collides with his stockpile, forcing him to give rather than trade. Causality holds: the melody on the wind motivates her climb, the jars enable the gift, the gift loosens the knot and propels him downward. Cost is legible in "pockets empty except for pennies and silence, and felt strangely rich"—a reweighting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The story accumulates pressure through sensory density ("hum hardened into a chord," "walls had inhaled") and escalates via the warped binding note, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief, shared breath) with felt cost—Elias must adapt ritual and risk his voice to avert awakening. One meaningful deepening (shifting from memorized chant to flexible, dangerous adaptation) narrows options. Minor deduction: the monks' backstory arrives mid-narrative without present-scene anchoring stimulus, creating slight orientation debt, but the closure remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors are clear early; the piece accumulates pattern and density through the three days of tasks, building to the viaduct basin scene where the protagonist feels "slow lightning" and sees "patient revolution" crystallized. The closure reweights impatience as a material to sculpt, with felt cost in the protagonist's recognition of prior fear-driven haste. One meaningful deepening is present, but the causality between the pointless-seeming tasks and the basin revelation could be tighter—"listening" is declared effective without showing why crow-tracking prepared this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (investigator, tunnel, post-drought inspection). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: accumulative textural pressure (lantern memories, overlapping apparitions) building to a situational stance crystallization. The closure is a Charged Poise moment—the protagonist commits to writing what he sees, reweighting his relationship to authority—with conceptual cost (endangering budget, job). The cost is legible in "no matter whose budget it endangered" and the apology, though the choice itself remains prospective rather than a completed on-page action. One meaningful deepening occurs when the overlapping men appear and force the question about signed-off deaths.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's instruction to "tell the board what you hear" crystallizes Elias's stance and reconfigures his role with felt cost—he must now stand beside uncertainty rather than certainty. The tightening occurs through the winding of the heart and Mara's reframing, and the cost (guiding a choice he doubted he deserved to guide) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (workshop, Orin, Kalei) land clearly within the first third. The story accumulates yearning through kaleidoscope images, arrow vibration, and the Algorithm's dream, then delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Orin pierces the sky's blind spot, the bell realizes it exists, and "the world shuddered politely, as though amused by its own upgrade." Cost is conceptual—the future is struck awake—but the final whooping line ("wildly unprepared for whatever the Algorithm would want next") admits vulnerability without showing a forfeited path or decision. The closure reads as Charged Poise with felt stakes, though the exact price Orin pays remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: the recurring 713 pattern builds density, the archive's "echo" motif deepens, and the final query treating silence-as-content provides a meaningful conceptual turn. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator "knowing at last" where deleted files go constitutes Charged Poise—options crystallize, the hunt ends). Cost is felt conceptually (complicity in a system that hides people) but could be more visceral on the page. Orientation anchors clearly within the first paragraph (corporate memory keeper, social network archive).

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through mirrored futures and converges in Ira's proposal to "reconstitute the accord" via the mirrors, reweighting the treaty from ownership to voice. Closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the final image shows Ira using mirrors to co-create rather than dictate, foreclosing the Keeper model with felt cost (they will resist, the anomaly's shoulders ease but her shadow "leaned a little closer"—poise, not resolution). The cost is conceptual and relational, legible in "slowly, via glimpses" and "something the orchard chose." One meaningful deepening is present. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the fourth paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist realizes "it was not the sound of death, but of everything choosing, moment by moment, not to end just yet," a reweighting that opens "a spaciousness" and "a narrow but undeniable path back toward living." The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (ice floes, cataloging debris, tapping vibrations) and held through the boat scene where the parasol tip becomes the tuning fork for existential choice. Cost is legible: abandoning the week-long march toward legal death, accepting the uncertainty of continued living. One meaningful deepening occurs when Runa's instruction sends the protagonist out alone, and the final vibration reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors (Tomas, station, vineyard) appear early. The piece offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the woman sits, receives the letter fragment, and Tomas speaks a parallel that reframes her missed bus as a mirror to a prior failure—but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page. The closing lines loop back to earlier phrasing ("destined mismatches," "fragile bridge") without a visible price or tactical shift that makes a before/after legible in the woman's immediate options. The retrospective reveal ("She had given him a letter to burn") undermines causality by inserting a key fact off-page, undercutting the closure's immediacy and felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines; the timeframe "after the prophet arrives" is signaled early and held. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the parapet's grinding and the line walker's cable-steadying work until the whispered intervention deepens the prophet's method, producing a final stilling with visible cost (the merchant's exposure, the parapet's exhale). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the city gains a "quiet, enduring wall" of echoes), and the cost is legible in the merchant's trapped mirror-moment and the dunes' rest. One meaningful deepening (the line walker's realization that honesty alone won't suffice) tightens the approach and shifts tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (archivist, lavender field behind factory, present day hiring). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases from solo arrival to crowded table, from one boy to communal constellation-building, and the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights the protagonist's role from passive curator to active host. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the communal puzzle with undeniable pressure, and the cost is the forfeiture of archival distance. One meaningful deepening satisfies the 600–800 word requirement, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence ("Elias unlocked the shadowed library at dawn"). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered crystal-voices, culminating in a cadence shift when Elias realizes "growth did not move in straight lines" and chooses to testify in fractured sequences. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image—"the suspended hush followed, clinging to his clothes, a barely audible armor"—crystallizes his stance with felt cost (fear, loss of safety) and reconfigures his relationship to silence and testimony. One meaningful deepening (from cataloging to active resistance) narrows his options with undeniable pressure at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of fog, erasure, and forgetting early; driftwood markers converge toward a charged center where the narrator and Mara locate "the sound of growing older" and recognize themselves becoming seekers. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the prophet poised to write, already forgetting, while "the metal would not release" the words—a final image that reweights prophecy as collaborative endurance with palpable cost. One minor gap: the cost at closure is conceptual (the prophet's cycle, the failure of language) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters the narrator's next move.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece accumulates sensory density (tremor, clock hand, stellar flare) toward a decisive act—Ilias bypasses safety locks, restructures Camera Three, and captures the data—that forecloses the safer path with felt cost ("risk breaking the tool"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: "held the configuration steady… sealing their brief, stolen clarity inside the archive" crystallizes the observatory's survival and Ilias's fidelity to Alma's mission. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, tremor, Ilias) land by ~10% of the text. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quake peaks and Ilias decides to push past protocol. Cost is legible: if he fails, "they were only another crater."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (Room 407, blood work, hospice). The piece accumulates density through layered images (clouds, cologne, vinyl fragment, song) that converge at closure when "the silence that followed was full, not empty, a silence that knew what had been said." Cost is legible: the song becomes the vehicle for goodbye, and the moment forecloses the path forward (death is acknowledged and ritualized). One meaningful deepening occurs when the folded lab results are set aside unopened, shifting from medical confirmation to ritual farewell. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal underpinning. Orientation anchors (Lysa, observatory, after spoons bent) arrive early. Escalation proceeds through because/therefore: she climbs without permission → places the key → turns it → shadows crawl into loops → she realizes shadows go "where meaning was unfinished." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image—"noon held more night than midnight"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (her scholarly certainty is overturned, "something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom"). Cost is legible in the irreversible shift from reverent scholar to one who knows the world seals awakenings. One hairline slip: the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than intellectually summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with lyric compression: Mara's suspicion of the substitute body drives her to the garden, the tooth opens a doorway to the displaced boy, and her decision to finish Tomas's work delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the substitute body crumbles; doubt becomes "almost bearable"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Mara, her table, after the substitute body is found). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Mara steps through a fracture in certainty and accepts the role of miracle-worker despite her skepticism—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth "tugs" at her fractured certainty, opening the doorway.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist opens the cloth, refugees' faces fill with glow, and the final image—"the world holds still, listening to its own heart learn a gentler way to shine"—reweights the opening vow with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density increases through memory layering, the polishing ritual deepens, and the cadence shift at closure charges prior material. Orientation anchors (grotto, mist, narrator's craft) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful tightening: the memory of village children resurfaces and converges with present refugees, narrowing the narrator's path to this exact act.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening beat (Mara at the derelict data center, post-confession virality), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered particulars (moss constellations, trays of salvaged metal, the pendant's history) until the final kneeling gesture reweights the dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—with visible cost (soaking knees, trembling voice, "slightly less alone"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's choice to stay and press starters into soil crystallizes her shift from passive exposure to quiet agency, and the cost is felt on the page. One mild orientation delay: the confession's content and "the crime she had described" remain vague past the first third, though this abstraction does not obscure the present-tense pressure or closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the first 15% without a clear present-tense frame until the riverfront encounter. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and motif return), but the closure unit—"endings are shorelines"—lands as thematic assertion rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The seashell fragment enables visions but does not narrow options or foreclose a path on the page. Cost remains conceptual and oblique, not dramatized in a final action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (village gate, arbor at dawn, tinkerer unpacking tools). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the tinkerer coaxes notes, villagers join, phrases spill into roots, tree straightens, fruit swells. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bowl captures sounds and the pouring completes the cycle. However, the cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path for the tinkerer or villagers. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (restored practices), but the price paid (what was risked or lost?) is not legible on the page, only the positive outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who (alchemist), where (subarctic crater orchard), and what (mapping heartbeats with starlight) by the second paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through the layering of twig-patterns, starlight release, planetary pulse alignment, and the luminous diagram's emergence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"the map was enough" crystallizes his solitary labor's meaning with felt cost (no travelers exist, yet he works as if they do). One tightening suffices: the starlight's fall where "heartbeat struck hardest" transforms scattered twigs into coherent routes. Cost is visible in his acceptance of working for "absent feet."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (locksmith, cavern, tonight) arrive early. The piece accumulates detail and cadence around the timer repair, culminating in a moment where the restored device "held echoes and the angles by which to find them again"—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights wonder. Cost is oblique: the locksmith's effort and the questions he asks are implied sacrifices, but no sharp before/after in his situation or options is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (the realization that the device was "built to keep wonder close"), satisfying the length expectation, though the final cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist confronts her own burden, orients to it rather than from it, and integrates it into the grotto's pattern with a felt cost ("I carried no less burden, only a clearer way to bear it"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery and the shingled hush, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the opening premise. Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (bronze grotto, after snowmelt, solo ritual). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist's own fear surfaces and threatens to calcify, forcing the climactic choice. Minor cost-legibility issue: the "promise that even weight can learn to move" risks abstraction, though the lamp-lifting gesture and the final carried burden anchor it concretely enough.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening beats (loft, skylight, kettle, fairgrounds below). The Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through interleaved memory and present tactile engagement with the blank, culminating in the knife's first stroke—a Charged Poise moment where the cost (ending the pause, allowing change) is felt even if not yet paid in full. The circus truck taillights reinforce the "here and gone" frame, and the final line reweights the blank from container of grief to tool of forward motion. One micro turn (setting the blank down, then reaching for the knife) supports rather than fragments the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic structure early—carousel, lagoon, ghost negotiation—and accumulates density through interwoven imagery (gears, music, reflections) that tightens toward the closure beat. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist empties their pockets, the ghost absorbs the relics, and the final image of "overlapping selves" reweights the scavenging premise with visible cost (the protagonist's burden transferred, their hollowness acknowledged). Orientation is clear by line 3. One slip: the causal link between collecting fragments and the ghost's final acceptance could be sharper; the ghost's critique ("echoes when you could have spoken") lands thematically but the transactional logic of the exchange is slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through interwoven carnival/spaceport systems, metaphor clusters (flow, navigation, intention), and the midnight-to-dawn span. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's nod and hand-drawn signs crystallize her stance—redirecting hope through systems no one may see—with the conceptual cost implicit in "no one might ever see them, but the building would." One meaningful tightening occurs when she links graywater lines to planters. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (petrichor, rain, brass teeth with "bad memories") and culminates in a cadence shift when Elias steps back to his desk and begins "a new line." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he accepts the sanctuary not as hiding place but as "a room where even abandoned hours are written down and gently kept," foreclosing flight with conceptual cost legible in the reweighting of his vocation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the repair choice transforms his relationship to his own failure, and the cost—accepting that bearing others' hours can itself be inventive—is undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: the protagonist's refusal crystallizes options and reconfigures the relationship with the two men, with cost felt in the dangerous honesty that follows. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; each beat (rumor → dive → discovery → confrontation) tightens options through protagonist choice. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (towpath, Lock Eleven, narrator's quest). One meaningful deepening occurs when documents confirm a geometry of deceit, narrowing the narrator's capacity for disbelief and forcing the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (Eli, harbor dock, snow). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: "felt the seeds and knots of the world turn slowly toward another spring" crystallizes the stakes with undeniable pressure, reweighting preservation as an act of listening rather than collecting. The woman's appearance and instruction provide the final tightening, narrowing Eli's understanding to "what holds fast." Cost is felt (he must now listen differently, commit to rope as well as seed) but the price remains oblique rather than sharp—no path is visibly foreclosed on the page, only redirected.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening sequence (harbor/cliffs → garden/palace). The accumulative/textural lens holds: the narrator's journey into the garden functions as a spatial deepening that reweights "explained absences" from abstract commission to shared pilgrimage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final line "I carried her presence like a lantern" crystallizes the narrator's shift from writing *about* absences to inhabiting them, with the conceptual cost of professional distance forfeited. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera invites the narrator to walk the path, narrowing the task from external documentation to participatory witness.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is established early (suspended palace, prince, mechanical world). The drive lens reads as Situational: the egg's discovery forces the prince to crystallize a stance against syndicates and philosophers. Closure is Charged Poise—the prince commits to vigil, redefining his role with visible cost (breaking laws, defying advisors). The cost is legible: "All my life you have asked me to approve advertisements for possible worlds. Now a possible world has arrived." One meaningful tightening occurs when the egg flutters under his touch and the memory sears through him, narrowing options to custodianship or foolishness.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maris's gesture of returning the coin *with* the jar reweights her relationship to her father's legacy with visible cost (surrendering the "only thing of her father's the court had not burned"). The causal lens holds throughout; her choice to graft one story to another arises from established interior pressure and the boy's plea. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by line 5), and the single meaningful tightening—fire advancing while she decides whether to turn her back—narrows options with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: breadcrumbs accumulate into a trail, fountains unlock sequentially, pressure tightens as the city "started to remember being afraid." Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Lira's skepticism shattered, memories restored—and the final image of fountains breathing coheres under the chosen lens. Orientation anchors (city, Lira, her mission) arrive early. The causal chain from fountain to fountain to box reads cleanly, though the mechanics of why touching the kite-string unlocks that fountain remain slightly opaque, handled more lyrically than causally.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (wilting stars, falling petals, budding suns), with a clear cadence shift in the final paragraph where the protagonist moves from observation to active intervention ("closing luminous filaments," "spreading dim warmth"). Closure is Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes the protagonist's stance ("tender and troubled, quiet and unafraid") and reconfigures the opening despair into purposeful action, with conceptual cost visible in the conditional "perhaps" that admits uncertainty. Orientation anchors who (otherworldly sentimentalist), where (nebula garden), and what (tending stars) by the second paragraph. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and sustains coherent pressure through the recurring question of whether exile merely extends or breaks generational harm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through nightly carving sessions, the ribbon accumulates charcoal marks mapping grief, and the final retracing reconfigures all prior material into one body of shared ache. Orientation anchors (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, butterfly migration) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image of butterflies rising "like a great, steadying hand" reweights the entire carving practice with felt cost—Elias has externalized private grief into communal ritual. One minor causality slip: the grandmother's announcement "this year, the butterflies will stay longer" is asserted rather than discovered, though it sets the structural frame clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the narrator commits to shared teaching rather than solitary penance, foreclosing the old path with visible cost. The pendulum's arrested swing teaches the lyric lens early and holds through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (tower, harbor, obsidian ridge). One micro-tension: the "kneeling of time" frame risks slight abstraction, but the concrete image of the hanging brass bob and the narrator's tactile memory keep causality legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric elements.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the narrator learns they are the undead gardener and that graves "awaited not flowers but decisions," reweighting all prior tending as avoidance. Cost is conceptual and felt—the loss of the comforting fiction of mere service. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: whispers, tapestry fragments, and notebook sketches build density until the silo scene crystallizes pattern into meaning. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (cemetery, night shift, chess clock). One concern: the tapestry's mechanics (how matching the strip "hummed" the silo into revelation) remain slightly abstract, and the final descent offers emotional exhale but no new action or foreclosed path, keeping this just under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, held cleanly through closure. The piece moves from duty-as-prison through predictive modeling attempts to the discovery of the three-year cycle pattern, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elian lowers the nib with visible cost (surrendering the last second of possibility, committing to a flexible plan that demands more of the kingdom). Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 5). One meaningful tightening occurs when the temperature-chart rhythm crystallizes the leapfrogging solution, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is legible: the design "asked more of the kingdom, demanded patience," and Elian's fierce joy signals he's trading certainty for ethics. The final image—nib descending—reconfigures the initial constraint (blank page as decision boundary) with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure gathers through layered images (ash, dial glow, dust mixture instructions) and the boy's arrival crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lina's solitary experiment becomes witnessed, collective work. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (hill, alcove, Lina). The closure lands with felt cost: her secrecy yields to shared risk. One structural friction: the pirate broadcast's instructions (grind charcoal, cloak with spit) feel ornamental rather than causally tested on the page, slightly softening escalation linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (Mara, gallery, rocking chair) and follows an accumulative/textural lens: the ash-scattering ceremony builds density through layered backstory (fire, grandmother, drawing strangers) and arrives at a Charged Poise closure where the collective recognition of fragility crystallizes without breaking the silence. The final line—"nobody pretends they are safe"—reconfigures the mirage-of-safety stake with conceptual cost (the illusion stripped). However, the middle section relies on reflective backstory rather than on-page reversals, and the cost remains oblique (conceptual stripping rather than a visible forfeiture or altered tactic).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (narrator, storm drains, post-plague sunken city). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through repeated preservation acts (collecting cogs, scrubbing brass, testing tales against shear marks) until the final image—"truth settles like silt... waiting for whatever rationally rebellious rat finally digs deep enough to feel its teeth on metal"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (endurance as rebellion, silence as price). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator's sewer archive becomes the only honest ledger, and the cost is legible in the image of isolation and patience. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern break (silence → wary note → bridge tone → final tentative chord) with the zither rosette recurring to charge the ending image. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Dari and Ilan move from group singing to standing together over the instrument, reweighting the dominant stake (bridging refusal). Cost is legible but oblique: "the patience that precedes" forgiveness and chairs that "shrank" show incremental change rather than a decisive rupture, landing as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final beat's uncertainty ("unsure whether to speak or play").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered actions (tasting the seed, clearing beds, planting cuttings) that deepen the stake (waking the greenhouse) without strict causal linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: "something new had already taken their place, rooted now in soil and mind" crystallizes the shift from ruin to stubborn renewal, and the cost is legible (the seed lodged in Ariel's chest, the alignment fading). One meaningful deepening occurs when Ariel swallows and the warmth guides her hands, narrowing options to this gamble. The lens holds, though the final image leans more toward thematic assertion than scene-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marla's conditional assertion reweights the blackout stakes and the tower responds, crystallizing options with felt cost (her throat tightens, she "envied liars their delay"). The causal lens holds—boy's arrival, riddle, Marla's compelled answer, granddad's wired condition, her final truth—with one meaningful tightening when the riddle answer narrows her duty/wonder conflict. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marla, booth, bridge, blackout). Small deduction: the granddad's engineered lesson and wired city mechanism arrive somewhat late and rely on the boy's exposition rather than prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Eli's question "if his own life was a creeping normality the house had noticed" inverts observer/observed with felt cost, reweighting the premise. The accumulative lens—pressure built through cataloging, ritual creation, orris-root placement—coheres and tightens when the corner "stiffens" and he answers by moving the bed. Orientation anchors (bay house, spring, rental) arrive early. One meaningful deepening (dropping the shard, repositioning the bed) narrows options and charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: the statue's revelation → visitor arrives → ampoule holds the secret → collapse planned → visitor consents → ceiling bursts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the statue settles deeper, certainty cracked for nuance to root, with visible cost (physical dissolution, loss of guarded purpose). One meaningful tightening occurs when the visitor presses the column, narrowing options and triggering the flood. Cost is legible in the final image: the statue's thoughts echo "like receding waves."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through recurring images (steps, dice, notebook, crack) that deepen meaning at each pass. The crack-rupture midpoint offers a micro turn where Arin glimpses his alternate self, then the closure reweights the texture metaphor: he realizes texture belongs to "the grain of the present scuffing beneath his boots," not the missed opportunity. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the final image reprices effort and choice with felt cost (doors he will never open). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening lines (staircase, Arin, boots, dice). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and cost is legible in the final paragraph's renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through parallel memory-flashes (nurse, cyclist, man) that demonstrate the theory Aurelia sought to prove. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): "her theory was already partly proven" reweights the premise with undeniable confirmation. Orientation anchors early (rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, waxing moon). The cost is conceptual and social—strangers' worlds shift—but Aurelia pays no visible price herself, which slightly softens the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (museum/refugee camp, baking initials, emerald-glass vision) and deepens via the protagonist's deepening immersion. Orientation anchors (grotto city, waterfall, Lira as guide) land by ~15% of text. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator stays "after my contract ended, teaching children to bind stories to their letters of bread, wondering which of us history would spare"—a renunciation of the extraction mission with undeniable opportunity cost and existential stakes made legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (kitchen scene → emerald-glass revelation → final commitment) tightens the dominant stake from passive cataloging to active transmission. Cost is visible: the narrator forgoes extraction and assumes the displaced persons' uncertain fate.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Causal spine. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the boatman's refusal. The yoyo dissection provides a meaningful causal turn that narrows options, and the final casting delivers Charged Poise—the lighthouse trembles, "answering with a future still unwritten," reweighting all prior material with undeniable pressure and cost (he has irreversibly engaged the mechanism). One cap consideration: the "hunger stone" premise is seeded late in exposition rather than dramatized early, creating mild setup debt, but closure remains legible and the cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: drowning → resuscitation → photographically cursed → funhouse journey → confession → clasp retrieved → curse lifted. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the Polaroid now shows him alive) and visible cost (he must confess his deeper fear). Orientation is prompt (funhouse, tonight, post-resuscitation by line 3). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias steps through the mirror and confronts the boy. The cost is legible in the confession and the boy's surprise, but the boy's capitulation lacks friction—no second reversal or complication tests Elias's resolve, so the turn feels slightly undercooked.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: floating orchard, Aera, blue hour, xylophone mallet. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered imagery (clouds, waves, casks, percussion) and culminates in a cadence shift where resistance becomes song. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (restless euphony replaces snarled paths) with visible cost: fear remains but now carries them forward. One deduction: the grandmother flashback, while brief, could anchor more tightly to a present stimulus rather than arriving as pure memory.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—shell-pattern fragments accumulate, the rusted gate and silent watchers recur, and Keth's final whistle crystallizes a Charged Poise moment where turning the turtles reconfigures all prior stakes. Orientation anchors by line 2 (Keth, western balcony, harbor city on turtles, day the gate rusted shut). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: Keth defies the Council's refusal, carves a question into the shell, and calls the turtles with a new note—pressure is undeniable, the city's survival hinges on the turn, and the cost (potential disaster, isolation) is implicit but legible in "the sun pressed down like a hand, bright, heavy, and uncaring" giving way to movement. One tightening: broken spirals force Council confrontation; one deepening: Keth's carved question and whistle reweight all prior cartography into live action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece lands Charged Poise: Elias's ultimatum and departure crystallize options with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost—faith versus night vision, control versus truth. The causal lens holds: the meeting was demanded, the illuminated T triggers memory, Mara's resistance escalates, and Elias's threat forecloses negotiation. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs. One tightening (the contract ultimatum) narrows options with felt stakes. Cost is legible in Mara's hesitation and Elias's willingness to "undermine the faith that keeps millions steady."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with light Situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (causeway, harbor, low tide). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—"absence, properly mapped, can burn"—reweights the premise with undeniable pressure, and the grout sealing her notes forecloses retrieval, imposing felt cost. However, the middle third loops through similar actions (measure, write, seal) without a meaningful deepening or tightening that narrows options; the single move from shore to pavilion serves as transition rather than escalation, leaving escalation clarity just short of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, forgotten library, sunken city, blackout established by ~100 words. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the blackout creates "reclaimed stillness" that allows secrets to surface, pressure accrues through gap-tracing, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara discovers the hidden folio, testimonies unfurl, "unapproved yet unmistakably true." The final image reweights her years of indexing with conceptual cost (institutional complicity now undeniable). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from suspicion to physical proof. Cost is legible: she crosses from archivist to dissident. Lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of grief-work through dream recording, shadow detachment, and gem polishing that converges at closure when Liora transforms her daughter's memory into paper cranes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she finally engages the memory she has "refused to distill," and the cost is legible—"her heart feels flayed" and the cranes "carry a sliver of grief, sharpened but bearable." Orientation anchors (Liora, floating island, twilight, post-shadow-detachment) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the memory to the copper wheel and the scene clarifies. The textural accumulation holds, though the causality between steps (shadow detachment → basilica waiting → gem polishing → crane folding) relies more on ritual logic than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through iterative reflection on the wedding blast, the geode's physical presence, and the vortex on the screen, culminating in a cadence shift when the narrator redirects the model. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final line crystallizes a choice—"nudge the model toward repair instead of ruin"—with the cost made legible through prior reflection on complicity and the heating geode. Orientation is clear by line three (floating observatory, feeds, survivor identity). One persistent constraint (the vortex over the ruined village) shapes the final tactic. The lens holds; the closure lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly (pilgrim at observatory, post-war, dusk). The accumulative lens coheres: sensory details and symbolic recursions build toward the final star-grid alignment that reweights the chip's meaning. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant)—the final image of tuning "her heart to the new frequency of belonging" reconfigures the opening question with conceptual cost (abandoning command-driven legibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when starlight pools in the missing squares, narrowing her search from nostalgic drift to active pattern-matching. The cost remains somewhat oblique; the story does not show what tactical option she forecloses or what she must abandon to adopt this stance, though the image of releasing the headset gestures toward it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (genealogist), where (terrace/shore), and when (dusk/now) clearly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist moves through layers of reflection, discovery, and symbolic material, with pressure building through density rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the decision to "study these marks until I can read the truth they hold" forecloses the path of continued forgery with visible cost—accepting the burden of the father's legacy and the guilt of his own trade. The cost is legible in the shift from manufacturing comfort to confronting unsoftened truth, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (parapet, negotiator, moon-phase witness). The causal lens holds: the father's death from a misjudged negotiation → carrying the drawer pull → the present exchange → the uneven bargain → the choice of spy over brother, each turn narrowing options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: untethering the lantern becomes the physical enactment of the refusal, and the brother's gaze breaking supplies the emotional price on the page. One micro-ambiguity: the phrase "recycle mistakes into wisdom" hovers between causal motive and thematic assertion, but the choice itself dramatizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the kayak turn crystallizes a choice to paddle toward rather than away, with the astronomical compass as metronome keeping "imperfect time with a heart still undecided." Cost is visible—he does not know who will be ashore, the regrets persist as "cold steady rain," and the acknowledgment that he was "paddling toward them, not away" forecloses the surrender option. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through reflective density, the barnacle image, and the compass thumping, culminating in a cadence shift at the turn. One meaningful deepening (the barnacle realization) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece teaches its reflective mode early and holds the lens through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (city → stadium → tunnel → cavern → lake) and the final wade reweights the premise (memories stored externally). Orientation anchors early (city post-procedure, evening, solo journey). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the lake as "reservoir" of erased cruelty reconfigures the cleanse premise with conceptual cost (empathy vacuum upstairs). The cost is legible in the final image of "possibilities, branches… reaching back like accusing arms," though the last beat tilts toward summary rather than a decisive physical or perceptual snap.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (beast whisperer), where (orchard), and when (after phoenix rises) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail, the scent ritual, and corporeal transformation until the final image of shared inhabitation reweights the reunion stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—"we learn to inhabit them together, like moonlight inhabits every petal"—with conceptual cost (the protagonist becomes "an entire listening grove," losing human form). One tightening occurs when the metamorphosis completes and the bond is reforged, but the cost feels more atmospheric than a visible forfeiture of a live option established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring motifs (hand tracings, the crack, lost time) that deepen rather than reverse causally. Orientation anchors early (glade, moon, Lysander, cards) within the first ~100 words. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he gathers his artifacts, turns down the mountain, and commits to "begin to pay them back"—a renunciation of his previous pattern with visible emotional cost ("sob that hurt like swallowing glass"). The ending reweights the dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) by accepting that hours cannot be reclaimed but can be honored going forward, a credible choice with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure delivers a clean Decisive Change: the locked dimension yields with audible consequence after centuries of shadow-metabolizing work, triggered by the protagonist's near-weightless state in response to stubborn hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—archive memories stack pressure through frequency-reading until the final image reweights all prior immersions. One anchor delay: "recycled spaceship" and "dead star" establish setting but the protagonist's engineered nature arrives late in paragraph three, creating brief disorientation. Cost is legible: the protagonist has metabolized ten billion shadows to achieve this single yielding moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (volcano, beach, Niko with jars). The causal lens holds: tug → path → Lila → prophecy → evacuation → detour plan → lava diverts. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the collective detour succeeds, reweighting Niko's accidental agency with visible cost ("pumice scraped directly against the heart"). The ending summarizes gratitude rather than showing Niko's stance shift on the page, and the lava cooling "short of the camps" feels slightly assured rather than earned through visible friction, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Iri, tower, blackout) and follows a Situational/Accumulative lens: pressure accumulates through the blackout, Trann's arrival, the sundial message, and culminates in Iri's activation of the hidden circuits. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the locks "forgot which side was inside"—reweighting the fort's binary logic, with the conceptual cost legible (surveillance collapses, revolution begins). One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial reveals the map she had drawn years ago, narrowing her options to act tonight. The cost is conceptual and the final image reconfigures the premise, satisfying the lens, though the physical consequences remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the frictionless world accumulates density through images (glassy waves, floating eels, painted rocks) until the star-dust ritual triggers a pattern-lock that returns friction as a "tax collector." Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image (aurora drying like ink) reweights the premise with an undeniable conceptual cost: motion requires limits to produce meaning. The stakes (world sliding into stillness) are signaled early, and the rock-placement sequence tightens pressure through mathematical patterning. One persistent constraint (precognitive doubling) shapes tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—the vigil structure accumulates auroral imagery and censorship metaphors toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet's internal rarefaction: "the air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who/where/when). The one meaningful deepening occurs when the poet places his eye to the telescope and sees the cartography of scars made literal, crystallizing his stance with felt cost (he must now "go on living" bearing witness). Cost is present but oblique—internal shift rather than decisive external action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and objects (sundial, tin, light beams) accumulate meaning. Orientation anchors are clear early (glass atrium, Darius, waiting). However, closure is weak: the knock and arrival of the two figures feels like a beginning, not an ending. The "hidden overture finally began" line declares rather than dramatizes a reconfiguration. No visible cost, no foreclosed path, no felt consequence—just poised anticipation. Under the Accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; instead it promises future action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (vagrant penny poet narrator), where (rusted library), and when (tonight, as moon clears skyline) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image and the recurrence of molting/resistance/the coffee tin, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "we reopen the fracture toward light" after the patrol retreats—a Charged Poise moment where the cost of continuing is felt even if not yet paid. The closure lands on the page with the tin's retrieval and the narrator shedding the archivist persona, reweighting the opening's "borrowed names" and "false bottom" motifs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boots arrive and force a tactical choice, then the final image reconfigures the opening's fracture metaphor with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (causal entry via film discovery, accumulative texture in the arbor, situational crystallization at closure). Orientation anchors within opening lines (station, pianist, clock). The closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's invitation and Leon's counter-offer crystallize options with felt cost (leaving refuge versus returning with transformed stance); the arbor's pathways unfolding and the compass flaring signal reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Leon challenges the arbor's purpose, narrowing the stakes from hesitation-as-refuge to action-as-encore. Cost is legible in Mara's wary posture and the arbor's groan, though slightly more concrete consequence would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, ridge, lagoon village, pre-monsoon) land within the opening block. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through layered omens (children's dialects, spiral maps, goats staring seaward) and deepens in the dream sequence, where the tree's revelation reweights the premise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael's realization that "to accept it would stretch their collective memory across an ocean and admit they had once been lost"—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The dream beats feel slightly padded with lyric repetition, and the final decision is poised rather than executed, but the reconfiguration of the island's origin story lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors early (islet, tutor, compass, post-severance), accumulates motifs (compass → lace → grove → ghost ships), and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology blooms as violet light; mist thickens with ghost ships). The closure reweights prior material and offers Charged Poise: "a space had opened that her forgiveness might one day cross." Cost is legible—he releases the apology without guarantee of receipt, foreclosing the fantasy of direct contact. One meaningful deepening (compass locks, leads him to second lace) tightens options under the accumulative lens. Minor slip: the final paragraph's "felt something ease" borders on soft summary, but the preceding image (violet light, ghost ships coalescing) sufficiently charges the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with reflection, anchored quickly in the greenhouse “weeks after the flood,” and driving toward the installation of the device and the articulation of her new approach. The accumulative/textural lens holds: past catastrophe → loss → reoriented method → ending image of quiet, cumulative truth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she commits to a new mode of attention and the final line (“that was how most truths arrived, quiet and cumulative”) conceptually reprices the earlier supernova-drama paradigm with felt cost. Stakes are modest but coherent; no major causal gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: return to the canyon → discovery and inspection of the ledger → canyon “answer” and memory → realization of sabotage → arrows revealing a path → decision to pursue. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly, and the lyric mode never obscures basic situational clarity. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the narrator chooses to leave the blast site and walk toward the implied antagonist, with the cost of re-entering danger clearly felt. The one slightly hazy element—the canyon’s near-mystical responsiveness—is consistent enough not to disrupt the structural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: waking in the conservatory → recalling the capsize and diagnosis → discovering the note/diagrams → reactivating the system → testing grief and wonder profiles → crystallizing a city-scale plan. Causality holds under the textural lens, and the closure—conceptual repricing and charged poise around turning architectures into orchestras—lands on the page. The before/after (passive, disoriented survivor vs. active architect of a new sensory system) is legible, with the persistent constraint of global silence shaping tactics. The cost is more implied than dramatized (we don’t see social or bodily sacrifice beyond what’s established), which keeps this shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain from package → coordinates → descent → library → new task is clean and legible, with no orientation debt and a clear single-POV throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias redefines his occupation from burying bodies to shelving unrestful lives, with a conceptual cost—his “rest” will never be simple again. Escalation is structurally sound but gentle; there’s little real resistance or complication once he decides to row out. The metaphysical stakes are large but mostly declared rather than tested in concrete jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single night stakeout that leads to a reveal, a reframe, and a decision, all causally linked. The global drive reads as situational with causal support: the sanctions and food shortage create pressure; Mara’s watch leads to encountering Kito; their conversation forces a stance on secrecy versus transparency. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara reinterprets the donations as a covenant and commits to a new way of naming it, with a clear conceptual cost (risking the fragile tacit system). It’s quiet but fully coherent; one more beat of immediate consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a tight accumulative arc: monk → Tear → experiment → corridor vision → conceptual realization → applied act with the boy. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: unused love is reconceived as breath-space and made actionable through the exhaled lantern, with a legible before/after. Causality is intact and legible despite the lyricism; nothing important teleports or resolves by coincidence. The only limit is that the “covered wound” darkness is gestured at but not quite put under direct narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: discovery of the halo, retrocognitive photographs, escalating temporal distortion on the bridge, and final disintegration form a clear progression. Orientation—who, where, what kind of world—is established early and the surreal mechanics stay internally consistent. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she literally dissolves into the time-lattice, reweighting all earlier images of memory and recurrence. The cost of that choice (loss of individual continuity) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara’s prior knowledge of the arrow leads to her plan, her choice to be chained gives proximity, and the cough-triggered spill lets her decode the Overseer’s logic, culminating in her guiding his hands. Orientation is strong from early on (who/where/when all clear) and the vault/explosive mechanism is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise rather than decisive outcome—the operation has just begun—but the before/after shift in her leverage and options is clear. The material threat to the seeds and the coming breach keep the stakes concrete, though one more explicit on-page cost in the final beat would sharpen the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is very clean: dives → harvesting absences → prototype tests → memory re-evaluation culminate in a Conceptual Repricing of what “stopping” betrayal means. Causality under a textural lens is coherent—each new absence and test deepens rather than resets the central drive. The closure beat (“maybe that is all trust ever was...”) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the narrator abandons the fantasy of rewinding and accepts a more limited, painful usefulness. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the before/after in their stance is legible and grounded in on-page work.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the station under a time limit, decoding the flowers, encounter with the mirrored stranger, the jar’s opening, the vision in the viewfinder, and a reconfigured walk home. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each move grows from the prior (flowers → stranger → jar → revelation). Closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing of what the moonbeams and photos have been, with a felt cost. A hair more on-page consequence or complication after the revelation could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from discovery of Corin, through his history and current project, to a reweighted vision of the room and of inquiry itself. Causality is subtle but firm—his past in weaponized glass leads directly to this specific form of repair, and the bookmark-vessel process tracks clearly. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the control room’s function is redefined, and the narrator’s stance shifts with a felt cost in Corin’s renunciation and the narrator’s tentative openness. There are no orientation or lens-clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of erased identity → exile to the library → encounter with the cast and cipher → reframed understanding of fear → decision to confront the studio. Structure is linear and easy to follow within a single scene window, with backstory and reflection always anchored to concrete present stimuli (file burning, cast list, cast). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has not yet acted, but options and stakes are reweighted, and the risk of challenging the studio is legible. No major orientation or lens issues; the Causal/accumulative hybrid drive holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a tight single scene: approach, quiet before the storm, map-making, star extinguished, then a charged invitation to walk into darkness. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the star as clock, the storm’s return, and the completion of the map all lead naturally to the final poise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the problem of navigation without light becomes a problem of listening to silence—with a conceptual cost (abandoning light as the primary guide). Stakes skew abstract rather than concretely tested, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: courtyard set-up → iterative loops with growing awareness → key touch of the violin → experimentation across cycles → loop breakdown → evening confrontation with Dr. Roe. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing: HEPA-3 reconceives thought as a “place” between moments, with the cost legible in the melted violin and altered pattern tables. Causality within the premise is tight; every beat grows from the loop design and his choices, with no unkept setups. The scene’s before/after is clear and carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: intake of contraband, investigation with the lens and archive feed, then the dawn concert confrontation. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: curiosity → archival “eavesdropping” → recognition → decision to attend concert → decisive approach. Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change/RR when she steps out of her habitual isolation to meet the sender. Stakes and options are consistently legible, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: prognosis → choice of work → restoration of maze → evolving ritual with marbles → final reconfiguration where maze and man mirror each other. The drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural; each paragraph layers another aspect of luck, care, and observation rather than discrete plot turns. Closure lands in the final marble/mirror image as a resonant reconfiguration, with his life and the maze explicitly coupled. The trade-off is that there’s no strong inciting beat or mid-story hinge; the sense of time passing is more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Rae summons Ilen, explains the unstable manifold and stakes, he calibrates it, and the embryos stabilize, leading to a conceptual shift at the end. Orientation is excellent from the opening, with clear who/where/when and a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his belief that time moves sideways “because he had asked it to”—but the cost of possible failure is only stated, never materially tested on the page. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: rumor → trespass → discovery of the program → decoding → realization about silence → acceptance of the “score,” with no causality breaks. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why), and the accumulative drive is clear as each new musical insight deepens the situation rather than side-stepping it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from treating the house as a ruin to accepting a dangerous, subversive collaboration with the ghost. The cost is mostly conceptual and implied (political danger, personal sacrifice), which slightly limits impact but doesn’t undercut coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean from the opening: mountain station, post-evacuation, Mara and the oracle alone after her fever. The causal spine—fever confession → attempted erasure → oracle’s fault-tolerant retention → re-exposure of the hypothesis → recontextualization of the valley disaster—reads coherent under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment: Mara’s stance toward the hypothesis, and thus her future, is reconfigured with felt cost. The only small limitation is that concrete forward options (what she might now do beyond “carry the weight”) remain abstract, slightly softening the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece is tightly structured as one continuous causal sequence: fire → accusation → late-night psychics → tunnel search → emotional reframing at the valve altar. The global drive reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator partially repurchases Evan’s version of events. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and there are no causality breaks. The main limitation is that the external stakes are gestured more than tested; the story culminates in an internal revaluation rather than a hard decision under visible external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: the swan appears, transports him, opens a path, and his traversal triggers the library’s emergence above, ending in an earned Charged Poise as he remains at the river while the world rewrites. Causal links are clear under a Hybrid lens—his acceptance of the summons causes the environmental reconfiguration and the surfacing city of memory. Closure lands via a meaningful reconfiguration of his role and the world’s relationship to forgotten knowledge, with a conceptual price in his relinquished neutrality. Stakes and sequence are legible throughout, though the final beats lean more on mood than a sharply dramatized final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a brief pre-scene establishes Mara, the hair, and “ordinary magic,” then the eclipse courtyard scene unfolds in a continuous, legible arc. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative/textural lens: her long-term motive (nurture wonder) leads to the eclipse plan, which leads to the courtyard gathering, which culminates in the silence and her internal reconfiguration. Closure is on the page: the hair-curl memory “does not lance but open,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost. The only limitation is that the pressure curve remains gentle, with no major complicating turn beyond mood deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: fireplace → woman’s room → planetary axis slip → tapestry → older worry → realization about all ages asking the same question. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Brann recognizes the cross-era pattern and recommits to his work as the silo “listened with all its walls.” Causality is more associative than plot-driven, but each transition is clearly motivated by a concrete object he touches, avoiding disorientation. The cost—an eternal archivist’s labor in a world without new dreams—is implied rather than dramatized, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: bar frame → reflective context about fortunes becoming prophetic → disruption via Parker → ascent to lighthouse and decisive rerouting. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens, with the fortunes’ pattern leading to the realization that they’re steering more than dinner and thus to the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the information flow now loops back to the island, reweighting the stakes of those “playful” fortunes. The cost (risk to the island, deeper entanglement in unseen games) is conceptually legible but could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single causal scene: arrival → set-up of tools and rules → engagement with the demon → rhetorical cornering → demon’s exit, all under a clear Situational/accumulative lens. Closure is on-page and decisive—the demon “slipped free and left her breathing alone”—and the method of resolution (logic/rhetoric plus ritual) flows from earlier beats rather than arriving as a late rule change. However, the struggle feels comparatively low-friction: once Jonas begins his homily, the demon yields quickly, with limited sense that failure or partial failure was a real option. Stakes are conceptually high but the cost of success is more implied than dramatized, which dulls the final turn slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece is structured as a single accumulating night-watch, with reflection tightly anchored to present actions (drawing lines, aligning the shell, drafting fortunes). The drive is accumulative/textural: the pressure of time and longing thickens until the DO NOT WASTE line and the short fortune precipitate the charged final gesture. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: Eli reframes his homesickness into a poised readiness to “conduct” the coming morning, with the cost being his ongoing solitude and constrained agency. The only limit is that the stakes—while clear—remain modestly scaled and a touch abstract, so the felt cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: viaduct frame → entry into the seam → labyrinth of alternate choices → return to the viaduct with a decisive renunciation. Causality is clear under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: using the tablet causes visions, which drive the decision to retrace, which in turn simplifies the maze and restores gravity. Closure lands with cost—he emerges changed and discards the tablet, foreclosing the path of endless branching. The only slight limitation is that the emotional hinge before he steps sideways is more implied than dramatized beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: arrival in the cavern, set-up of the device, activation, and the children’s gradual thaw, all coherently linked. The causal chain around the broken needle, filament, and backward songs is legible and pays off directly in the tactile-emotional climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: silence transforms from oppressive weight to the medium of connection, with on-page cost in the children’s resurfacing grief and Eira’s risk of confronting their pain. There are no orientation or lens-clarity slips, and the final line crisply demarcates the “before/after.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean and causal: unease from being followed → discovery of the tube → deciphering the message → listening upwind → sighting pigeons → realizing their mapping role → choosing a new, covert vocation. Orientation is clear from early on (who, where, when, what the job is), and the quiet, accumulative build suits the premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: storms become systems of surveillance, and the narrator’s professional drive is redirected away from the ministry. The conceptual cost (risk, deeper entanglement) could be made more legible to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: Mara’s arrival and request, the shared experiment, then the grief-and-transformation beat, with the backstory interleaved at points that reweight the present rather than stall it. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: Mara’s misbehaving fragrance → UV reading → Aron’s message → Elias’s decision to face the memory → emotional and literal transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward scent and memory shifts, and tomorrow feels newly possible at a cost. The slight convenience of Mara’s fragrance linking so directly to Aron doesn’t break plausibility at this length but keeps it just shy of sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: stalled world → grotto → conversation → narrator’s options crystallizing, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure is a strong Charged Poise: the narrator now sees their life as a set of textured, non-binary choices, and that reframes everything before. Causality is modest but coherent—the beings stall buses, forcing the walk; the walk leads to the poet; his history and philosophy reconfigure the narrator’s options. The cost is conceptual/opportunity rather than enacted, but it’s legible in the foreclosed comfort of “a life where your choices are easy enough to be automatic.”

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: street → backstory of the fire and storytelling tradition → greenhouse performance → reweighted ending, with each shard causally or thematically linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elio shifts from supplicant to listener/participant in an unfinished world, embodied by giving Mara the coins and inverting the bowl beside the pumps. Causality is modest but coherent—the invitation, performance, and perceptual shift all follow. Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic, but the cost of renouncing the mendicant identity and the rainforest grief gives the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scene tracks cleanly from entrance to offer to acceptance with strong because/therefore causality under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure is a conceptual repricing: half-truths and “counterfeit” feelings are reweighted as scaffolds rather than simple corruption, with the cost of Eve’s shaken certainty made explicit. Stakes (her reliability as a memory auditor) are established early and revisited at the end via her new way of perceiving lies. There are no orientation issues or broken set-ups; everything introduced (static sense, blotter, counterfeit feelings) is paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—misdelivered letter → emotional disruption → visit to library → shared scheme—is clean and legible. The flashback is anchored and serves the present, and the story resolves around a clear reconfiguration of Elias’s options and intentions. Closure works as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: he exits with a new ongoing commitment, the harbor’s “commerce” conceptually repriced. The main limitation is that the cost and constraints of this new path remain mostly conceptual; nothing in the ending forces a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure—arrival → shared search → discovery of the tag → reorientation toward communal art—reads cleanly and causally under a textural lens. The three-night rumor frames a subtle closure: staying long enough reveals invisible kinship, fulfilled via Siltghost’s message and Elian’s decision. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, yet the before/after (solitary maker vs. communal facilitator) is legible. Stakes and turns are low-key but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous journey from departure to encounter to return, under an explicit temporal constraint (the giant’s nap) and a clear goal (find where echoes are born). Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens: following the hum → boundary where keeper stops → time-borrowing intensifies → confrontation with unborn echoes → renunciation and return. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: she chooses not to fix a single echo and reframes the commission as “drawings, not chains,” with conceptual cost in terms of power and payment. Stakes are abstract but coherent, and no set-up is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: a single scene that moves cleanly from arrival, attempt, crisis of method, to a shifted goal and closure. Causality tracks—he uses the mosaic and eyes to call Lio, the image frays, and the orchard’s implied cost forces a change in tactics. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Corren chooses acceptance and a future-oriented role rather than retrieval, with the price legible in what he forecloses. The accumulative, lyric drive is consistent and the ending cadence clearly marks a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the outage enables discovery of the tape, which triggers past and present echoes, which in turn motivate Marrow’s decision to act and reframe his role. Causality is intact and legible under a textural drive, with a clear before/after in his understanding of visibility. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from longing for literal sight to accepting mediated presence through others’ awakened senses, with emotional cost in his continued partial isolation. Stakes remain intimate, but for this scale the arc is fully realized and disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design where storm prep and return to the trellis build toward an internal reconfiguration rather than a big causal turn. Causality is nonetheless coherent: early lightning-struck linden → leaf in pocket → storm’s return → touch triggers the vision and realization. Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise moment, clearly marking a before/after in how she understands change. The structure is clean but leans heavily on mood, so the sense of options narrowing could be sharpened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: failed tide → discovery of the brooch → village confrontation → decision to leave → journey and checkpoint exchange. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with each beat logically prompting the next, especially Eron’s offhand suggestion hardening into Mara’s intention. Closure lands as a charged poise: she has crossed over, offered the brooch instead of papers, and the guard’s nod reframes the whole journey as an inevitable “exchange of hungers.” The cost of leaving and risking the city is implicit but legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: the arrival, destabilized ritual, pearl’s activation, and shared vision escalate toward a conceptual repricing of “future-telling” into “witnessing everyday magic.” Causality within this lyric frame is solid—the cave’s unpredictability interrupts Lyra’s plan, forcing the reconfiguration. Closure is clear: the before/after line is Lyra’s relinquished authority and Mira’s acceptance of an altered mandate of magic, with the pearl as concrete pivot. The only reason this doesn’t move into 9+ is that the cost, while legible, remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized through a sharper on-page loss or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—Mara’s walk, the discovery of the valve, the gathering, and Caven’s tentative note—builds cleanly toward a charged final poise. Causality is soft but coherent: storm and exile end → fragments surface → Mara curates them → crowd gathers → Caven is heartened enough to play. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s relationship to its own absences shifts in that hovering note. Stakes remain largely conceptual, which slightly limits the punch despite the elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and causal: punch → arrows → doorway → station → mandate, with no orientation issues and a clear single throughline. The piece lands on a solid Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure, reconfiguring his role from mapping physical routes to charting the way back from silence. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible: he’s being conscripted into a daunting, possibly endless task. A minor limitation is that escalation and consequence remain mostly internal and thematic, not concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene progression from arrival, through activation of the tile and rising disorientation, to a resolved stance at dawn. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: whales → tile activation → entangled memories → decision to transcribe as a way to honor both skepticism and legacy. Closure is clear and on-page: “my doubt had grown spacious enough to hold wonder without breaking” is a resonant reconfiguration with a visible cost in time, effort, and psychic vulnerability. Stakes remain intimate, so the arc is more deepening than sharply turning, but it functions fully at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: solar storm → amulet activation → geometric mutiny/vision → post-vision resolve, all coherently linked. Causality under the textural lens is strong; each new spatial disturbance reweights his understanding of goodbye and nudges him toward a different relation to his hiding place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: goodbye is redefined as a spatial re-arrangement, and he redraws the escondite in response. The cost—risking the safety of an essentially eternal stasis—is clearly implied in the final decision to loosen anchors and wait for the next storm.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: father’s death → need for asylum → discovery of the cylinder → ink-enabled comprehension → ethical choice, and closure lands on her decisive breach of the deal. The “consulate at dawn” clock gives structure even though the officials remain offstage. The hidden cylinder along the spine is a bit conveniently perfect but is thematically in-character for him and doesn’t break plausibility. The ending clearly reconfigures the situation with legible cost, even if consequences remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the method is taught early, varied via specific timestamps and histories, then tightened as he moves from invention to indexing and the lamp finally goes out. Cause-effect is coherent under a textural lens: silence → method with the lamp → growing archive → lamp’s failure → altered stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he can no longer “refract” but walks away with a quiet archive, having given the silence an “orderly spine” at real emotional cost. Stakes remain a bit abstract (no concrete external test of whether the town remembers), which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: mistaken death → move to port → unofficial archival work → encounter with his paper name → deliberate rewriting of his status. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new image of erasure (vanished ship, stowaways, missing numbers) deepens his stance until he consciously chooses to be “unfinished on purpose.” Closure lands through a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis when he writes a new death certificate with a blank name, redefining life as an ongoing revision. The cost—relinquishing any attempt to restore his old story—is legible in the quiet, charged final scene beneath the poison label.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: observatory → shell → cello → memory reframings → conceptual recognition of the compass → outward move back to the cliff. Causality is lyrical but coherent (shell hums with cello; the instrument retells conversations, which reconfigure her understanding of myth and the compass). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: myths as “pencil tracings of absence” and the compass as her hurtful questions, with cost in the choice to keep following an unanswered guide. Stakes remain internal but do culminate in a clear before/after stance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: Council mandate → covert graffiti counterplan → population drift → investors’ advance → leaked documents → Lilo’s massive serpent mural that crystallizes the choice. The hybrid causal/situational lens holds, and the ending functions as a clear Charged Poise, with stay/flee options and their costs legible. Reflection and backstory are interwoven with present-tense stakes and don’t blur the timeline or location. The main structural limitation is that escalation tops out at a looming decision rather than an on-page turn with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear countdown, present-tense pressure, and a closure beat when he chooses honesty, leaves his own print, and activates only the amber signal. Causality is tight under an accumulative/situational lens—each detail (countdown, harvesters, vials, daughter) layers tension rather than branching into new subplots. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he accepts the loss and limits his response to witnessing and a coded message. It stops just short of exceptional only because the external situation never pushes him into a more consequential outward act beyond refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: broken drone → diagnosis → experimental test via water → activation and release toward the harbor. Causality holds throughout, and the closure beat—“that is where you begin…because the world outside has called”—lands as a modest but coherent reconfiguration. The drive is largely accumulative/textural rather than high-causal, but it still narrows to a single, legible culminating act. The only limitation is the relatively low narrative cost; nothing in the plot threatens a meaningful before/after for the characters beyond a gentle resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: falcon return → mysterious note and scrap → condensation map → decision to cross → discovery of the true headwaters → choice to revise the atlas. Orientation (who/where/when) is established within a few lines, and the piece sustains one coherent scene with mounting pressure. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: she commits to an "honest revision" that will trouble her world. A touch more on-page consequence or immediate resistance would push this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: Ansel’s repeated walks and tuning actions gradually wake the bells, culminating in the wagon’s arrival and the town’s “shiver” into partial life. Causality is coherent under a textural drive—ritual creates pattern, which invites response. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration when a second human joins the rhythm and the bells “accept” the new weight. The cost—years of solitude and painstaking work—is mostly retrospective rather than directly sharpened in the final beats, limiting the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal throughline is clean: silence → distress ping → drone launch → discovery of pod → vial contact → revelation → choice to surrender. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, the accumulative/textural lens is stable, and the temple/vial logic holds without late-breaking rule cheats. Closure lands on-page with cost in the line “surrendered to the vial’s slow intake, becoming its final, solitary archive,” a clear before/after that reconfigures the premise. The only limitation is that the structural arc is very smooth—almost too frictionless—so the decisive beats never quite risk confusion or rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: arrival → listening → discovery of the hidden door → glimpse of the story-library → late reveal of the bodies and ticking clock. Orientation is clear from the outset, and each movement tightens or reweights the premise rather than meandering. Closure functions as a strong charged poise/incipient conceptual repricing: the prison redefines as a throat clogged with tales, and the future confrontation (“before they find the bodies”) is sharply set up with real conceptual cost. The only limit is that the decisive change remains just ahead of the page rather than partially enacted here.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: bead offered → memory tremor → recovered past-life bond → stated debt and terms → renewed vow, with the greenhouse’s reaction confirming the change. Orientation (who/where/what kind of world) is established quickly and never slips, even with lyric density. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses to resume an abandoned covenant, with a clear before/after in knowledge and obligation and an implied long-term cost. The structure is essentially one deepening scene and is very well contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night journey into the labyrinth with reflection interleaved, all clearly anchored in time and space from the opening. Causality is coherent and accumulative—he brings the plate, aligns it to prior scratches, alters the storm image, and ends with a reimagined harbor—and the sleepwalking backstory directly informs present tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has materially altered the founding myth in stone, with a legible before/after in how the harbor is depicted. The stakes stay intimate and internal, but the arc never loses its throughline or drifts into shapeless lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative, moving from arrival to growing attachment, the trench collapse discovery, and then the communal rebuilding and sundial alignment. Causality is intact—her presence and interest help reframe the archaeological find into a communal project—while the orchard and sundial recur to bind the arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Leila’s stance toward faith and belonging reweights all prior material, with a clear before/after. The piece remains quiet in terms of overt plot turns, but within its chosen scale the single major deepening (collapse → ring-calendar → rebuild) is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: from receiving the request through ruminative name-generation to the poised mailing, each beat logically deepens the same dilemma. Orientation is strong and early, and the world’s rules (surface mail, bureaucratic options, Neve’s marginal hacks) stay consistent. Closure lands as a Charged Poise at the slot—Neve hesitating with the envelope, the “whole future” paused—reconfiguring the earlier questions about time, identity, and destination with a quiet but legible cost. The stakes are modestly scaled but fully coherent under the accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night scene with a clear causal line (missing constellations → prince’s arrival → coded map → warning about erasure). The drive lens reads Hybrid, with a causal spine supported by accumulative motifs (rumors, constellations, candle behavior) that deepen stakes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the “path of absence” is reframed as both strategic and existentially dangerous. The only limiting factor is that external consequences (coup outcome, immediate danger) remain offstage, keeping the cost more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: client’s request → journey into the labyrinth → encounter with spirits via shard and condensation → vision of the pier argument → distilled message “I was afraid” that reconfigures what the client must do. The single time shift into the brother’s body is clearly anchored and smoothly returned from, and the world’s rules (labyrinth as apology-space, spirits responding to regret) are consistently applied. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lysa returns not with pardon but with a “fragile map” and the brother’s rephrased moment of decision, which comes with an implied emotional price for the client. The only restraint on a higher score is that Lysa’s achievement faces little resistance once the ritual starts; the outcome feels intense but not seriously in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story is cleanly structured as one continuous scene: pre-op waiting → consent/explanation → cast-reading ritual → invented message → coral handoff → corridor walk/closing reflection. Causality is tight at this length: the boy’s questions and time pressure push Mara into the lie and into accepting the coral, which reconfigures the meaning of her “translator” role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the final image of her fear and “unclaimed translations,” with cost in her compromised neutrality and burden of memory. The only slight limitation is that the external surgical outcome is left entirely offstage, so the closure leans almost wholly on interior/emblematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the wall → setup with projectors and knowledge network → activation → conceptual reweighting at the end. Causality holds under a textural lens, with each step naturally prompting the next, and the final realization (“not resurrecting his own glory…”) provides a clear Conceptual Repricing of his project. There’s no orientation debt: who/where/when are legible early, and the one-scene flow is coherent. The cost is quieter and more conceptual than dramatic, but it’s present and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves causally/accumulatively from mundane restoration through uncanny question to a reconfigured stance. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural: echoes, nested images, and repeated pauses build until the decisive verbal answer (“I know less… and I wish to know less still”) and the choice to abandon the plan. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the rules of her work and self-understanding are reweighted, with a legible before/after and conceptual cost. A slightly clearer articulation of external stakes (e.g., what she risks by not restoring as commissioned) could sharpen the closure’s felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear: a single, continuous scene in the greenhouse layered with concise world-building, building to the entomologist’s discovery and tacit alliance. Causality is clean under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: Thought Tariff → underground club → garden-language plan → entomologist confrontation → expanded conspiracy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (they now work openly with the entomologist, committing to a “grammar” beneath taxed dreams) with an implied but credible cost. The main limitation is that the central operation remains largely in planning mode; we don’t reach a tangible external test or reversal of their scheme.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is swift: insomniac poet, gargantuan shell-city, missing moon, all within the opening lines. The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric mode: moon missing → decision to act via postcard and song → coral response → negotiation → moon’s return → coda of writing and sleep. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world-without-moon becomes world-with-moon-accepted, with the cost being his acceptance of ongoing sleeplessness and cyclical ache. Stakes remain modestly scaled, but for this length the arc is cohesive and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: anomalous chime → investigation → emergent roaming song → decision to intervene → creation of a new orchid. Causality holds under a textural lens, with the cracked tube plausibly threatening the catalog and the wandering melody escalating from background disturbance to urgent pressure. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: he alters the archive by admitting a name that “had never been archived here,” with conceptual cost voiced in “almost, but not quite, saved.” The only minor limit is that the consequences for the library’s order remain implied rather than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, why) and the causal chain is straightforward: go to archive → summon Arithene grammar → bind self to a lattice of promises → walk out to the meeting changed. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with lyric inflection, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s speech is now structurally constrained toward truth, altering the stakes of the impending meeting. Cost is legible in the line about half-truths snagging and tearing, signaling a before/after. The only thing holding it short of exceptional is the relative smoothness of the process—no on-page setback or complication tests the method.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Arlen arrives with tools and philosophy, the council enters, conflict spikes, and his proposal leads to a collective reconfiguration around the chain. Causality is coherent under a situational lens: the city’s self-drowning laws → summons → argument → rotating-favor plan → shared reshaping of the chain into a circle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the council’s physical adjustment of the chain and Arlen’s internal “alignment” marking a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the resolution feels slightly easy—resistance ebbs quickly once the plan is offered, muting a fuller sense of hard-won cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from daily pattern in the attic → his backstory and avoidance → the woman’s arrival and demand → a quiet, time-lapsed rapprochement → the decisive act of composing and sending the lost song. Causality is clear under a textural lens—her appearance forces his stalled pattern to evolve toward a charged closure. The closure (writing and tying the song to a bird) is a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost rather than a neat fix. The only slight weakness is the compressed phrase “Across learning to trust again,” which summarizes a key stretch rather than giving one concrete moment within it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative structure is tight: terrace drift → decoding furniture → threshold experiment → sideways slide into maze → confrontation with father → refusal to cross. Causality holds even in the surreal frame: the code actually moves the terrace and opens the doors, the distance experiment actually dislocates her into the maze. Closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she consciously chooses not to step forward, and that choice is framed as maintaining the world’s calibration. Stakes and cost are explicit on the page, giving a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival with a nominal task (fix the lights), a mid-scene experiment (dimming one quadrant), and an overnight redesign that reframes both the problem and the narrator’s inner drive. Causality is quiet but legible: the narrator’s observation of how bodies move toward light leads to a new interpretation, and that insight leads directly to different tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “Belonging was not the fixed point on a chart…” plus the new breathing light-cycle establishes a clear before/after stance. The cost—releasing a purely technical role and surrendering to relational, shared noticing—registers on the page through the loosened “knot of smoke” and the abandonment of fixed charts.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: pattern of vanished paths → curiosity and unease → conjecture about seeds → descent into tunnel → conceptual revaluation of “missing pieces.” The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing when Lio reframes erasure as postponement and adjusts his ledger practice. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single excursion structure is elegant. The only limiter is that the decisive change is largely conceptual and low-risk, so the felt cost is more implied than forcefully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous scene in the flooded arcade that tightens from atmospheric setup to the bishop reveal. Causality is intact—his philosophy of “ordering randomness” drives each beat from coins to pebbles to the bishop in the pocket. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: both Marcus and the woman in red stand at a reweighted moment of possibility. The conceptual and emotional cost is subtle rather than sharp, so the before/after is meaningful but not seismic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: exile → arrival → moral hesitation → ritual → price → quiet aftermath, all in one continuous scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: the nostalgia ban and surveillance buoys necessitate the garden and the clandestine method, leading directly to Mareh’s sacrifice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost when her memory of her brother unmoors. There are no orientation issues, and the scene lands decisively without feeling over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene (with integrated recollection) running from arrival at dawn through the decision about the report and request for more time. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid: pond unease → call about potential demolition → present inspection and memories → decision to resist purely numerical framing and to watch the light one more day. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the atrium’s fate remains undecided, but the narrator’s stance and the stakes are reweighted with visible conceptual cost. Escalation is relatively quiet—no sharp reversal—but consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—a present-tense ridge scene braided with the past Miller fire—reads clean and purposeful, with causal links between youthful bargain, career path, and current mentoring moment. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Rafe finally externalizes the secret that has defined his life, in direct response to Maya’s crisis. Escalation is mostly internal and reflective, but the piece still tightens toward a clear, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear and effective: enter grotto; set up apparatus; test generous vs closed vs apathetic configurations; confront “Unlifted” futures; then choose a modest ascent as “enough to begin.” Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each new arrangement of objects leads to a reweighted reading on the gauge and deepens the narrator’s understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s futures and the narrator’s project are re-priced from grand salvation to modest, actionable ascent with emotional cost (grief for unlifted timelines). Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than situationally acute, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: each discovery (echo tremor → door → diaries → film → Mara’s notes → second echo) deepens the same core situation rather than flipping it. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when and job premise are all quickly established). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid in the decision to redraw the map and stay, with clear before/after in relation to walking away, though the external stakes of that choice remain understated. Structure is coherent and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: broad city-wide mirage work narrows to the focused, relational beat with the girl and her brother. Causality is coherent under the premise (lullabies → stirred sleepers → changed mirrors → altered dream image), and the closure lands on-page with the boy seeing himself step back from the river. The borrowed heartbeat and its eventual recall give the whole sequence a quiet but real cost. The stakes remain modestly scaled and largely conceptual, which keeps this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: arrival → ritual preparation → presentation of terms → amnesty dispute → signing, all under a single continuous scene. Causality is tight under a situational lens: the ritual pause enables negotiation, the clipboarded offer triggers the core conflict, the envoy’s resistance sharpens stakes, and the final signatures constitute a decisive change. Closure lands with cost—the truce is achieved at the price of “survivable disappointment” and morally tainted amnesty. Nothing crucial teleports or resets, and the before/after is legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: helicopter overview → reflective backstory of the drought and the egg → descent to the flats → following the “map” → ritualistic release. Causal and textural logics cooperate: his guilt-funded obsession leads him to the very landscape he created and then to the basin where he acts. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: offering the last egg back to the ruined habitat reframes both his philanthropy and his crime with a felt cost. The drive lens (accumulative with causal spine) is stable and the before/after line—egg as hoarded absolution vs. relinquished offering—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: courtyard summons → descent → sanctuary work → exhaled hush → palace-wide ripple → charged aftermath. Causality holds throughout—her alternative “harvest” directly produces the frozen snowfall and momentary lapse of rules, and the final recognition of treason vs new listening lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The piece maintains one coherent drive (her subversion of the king’s order) without tangents, and the pattern of image escalation is legible. The cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral, but it is clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight: prior off-page argument → hush → confrontation → reversal exercise → quiet reconfiguration, all causally linked. Backstory (the exploitative film, the puppet shows) is cleanly anchored and directly sharpens the present stakes rather than drifting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: their perspectives and the orbiting-stories image reweight the entire ethical question with felt cost. Nothing important teleports or resets; the scene feels fully earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens, moving from watching the monarch to constructing signals to the butterfly’s arrival and brief rest, with closure in the bowl of dew and resumed drifting. Causality is gentle but coherent: past helplessness → vow to honor histories → concrete architectural interventions for this monarch. Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world “bent around one small history,” with the cost of extinction present in the acknowledgment that the monarch will not live long. The structure is simple but fully legible, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the sanctum → explanation of the rope’s function → attempt to rebraid it → release of the names → vocational and internal reorientation. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: each step arises from the previous one, and the rope’s activation flows directly from his choice to engage and his long history of casting for the dead. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his work’s terms and his relationship to his failure are reweighted with cost (he must stay and accept this new vocation rooted in his old guilt). The only hairline slip is that pressure remains contemplative rather than sharply tested by any external constraint, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: dreams-as-directive, intrusion of stranger dreams, rising external pressure from the storm, and a final binary choice between sealing in and climbing out. Causality is strong under a situational/causal hybrid lens: the decaying directive and altered dreams set up the possibility of defection, and the storm collapse forces a stance. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Decisive Change hybrid—he “steps into the present,” clearly foreclosing the bunker-path with real risk. Every major setup (the wafer seal, final dream warning, “roads that did not exist”) pays off in the ending frame without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal spine: arrive at palace → set up experimental interface between tile and lights → observe near-misses and one stunning alignment → process the aftermath. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he does not get proof, but his drive is reweighted into “quiet, usable doubt” that feels like an earned stasis with conceptual cost. Causality is intact and legible, and the final choice to shut down the lights and leave preserves constraint rather than dissolving it. Plot is deliberately modest, so while structurally sound, it never strains toward more complex reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → introduction of box/sanctuary logic → induced memory replay → reconfiguration in the final image. Causality inside the speculative frame is coherent: turning the broken key triggers the reality shift, which in turn exposes the misremembered narrative and enables the conceptual turn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, but the before/after in self-conception is clear and carries cost. Nothing important is left unkept, and the single scene window holds together without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual in one location, with each step (arrival, attunement to fog, mapping, merger) causally following from the last. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the magical rules (synchronized breathing, sextant mapping dream-space) are taught through action. Closure is strong: the merger of Elias and the dream is on-page and clearly reconfigures the situation, with the district’s flare and return to calm signaling an after-state. The only slight limit is that the external consequences of success/failure remain abstract rather than sharpened into a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: contract → exploitative terms → breach → feral orchard → present return → tending and vision → new vow. Backstory is well-anchored in present cues (orchard, contract ashes, ribbon) and each revelation re-weights the current moment rather than pausing it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he forgoes institutional contracts in favor of a living bargain with the orchard, with the cost of absorbing “risk” and possible permanent separation from his daughter. Escalation is mostly conceptual/accumulative rather than plot-twisty, but it holds together under that lens without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a tight hybrid of causal and accumulative moves: we move from setup of the museum/orchard to the bathroom refuge, to the glowing cameo, to the mirror penetration, with each imaginative turn grounded in prior rules. Orientation (who/where) is clean very early, and the museum/orchard/book equivalence is taught before it’s asked to carry closure. Closure lands in Elias’s choice to cross the mirror and walk among the trees, with a conceptual repricing of his role—he becomes something the orchard will “inherit”—and that shift is legible. The main soft spot is that the cost of this choice remains mostly abstract (conceptual danger to chronology and selfhood) rather than sharply dramatized, though it is clearly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: the time traveler’s disruption → missing sections → Lysa’s arrival with the diary → research of gaps → renegotiation with the clerk → descent to the hidden chamber → the choice at her brother’s book. Closure is strong and costly: she accepts the mountain’s conditional collateral and chooses a path that risks her own future in order to be with her brother instead of simply erasing regret. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal with accumulative texture), but the causal chain never breaks, and each step narrows options rather than meandering. The final beat—a new “rescue mission” being added to the shelves—lands as a decisive change with conceptual and emotional cost clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: boarding → navigation through attractions → funhouse encounter → theater confrontation → decision to stay. Causality is coherent under a lyric, rule-bending lens, with the swatch card as clear payment and the twin’s touch as the trigger for the world’s transformation. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator abandons the recapture mission and chooses to remain with the twin; the before/after is legible and paid for. A slightly more concrete sense of what they’re sacrificing in the external world would sharpen the felt cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: rumor → impossible door → discovery of seal/rope/note → chiming thirteen → rebraiding → treaty’s true nature → reset to twelve and door’s erasure. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure is a conceptual repricing of absence (from miracle to wound) plus a decisive physical act. The cost is primarily conceptual—carrying remembrance rather than enjoying an elegant erasure—rather than dramatized as a difficult sacrifice. A slightly sharper sense of risk or consequence in the reconfiguration itself could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous descent with clear waypoints (cave mouth → ice fork → throat → hush) and a culminating ritual that reconfigures the storm’s sound. Causality in this accumulative/lyric mode is coherent—the ice-reading leads to the throat, the spores load the stone, the storm arrives, then the hush is forged—so the closure reads as an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost of holding this quiet against the storm is implied rather than dramatized through consequence or strain, so the before/after is conceptually strong but not fully tested in-scene. Still, the drive lens is stable and the final image clearly closes the narrative unit.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: years of ritual attempts culminate in the unpredicted comet and the successful alignment, giving a clear before/after. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: long-term preparation plus a contingent event plus a deliberate seizing of the moment leads to the prism’s release. Closure lands with cost—the revelation that he has spent a life in service to a single message—but the decisive change is more metaphysical than situational, with limited on-page narrowing of options beyond what we’re told he’s endured. The coincidence of the comet is thematically justified but still bears a lot of structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene: arrival, assessment of monuments, work at the lens, then a resonant morning-image. Causality within the lyric mode is strong: storm → shadow shifts → urgency to transcribe → stacked parchments → mutual memory recognition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the premise of one-way archiving is reweighted into a reciprocal exchange with conceptual cost (his partial self-surrender to the city). Stakes and turns are primarily conceptual rather than dramatic, which slightly limits the sense of narrowing options despite the storm/dawn frame.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tight: one continuous scene where preparation, reflection, and ignition build cleanly to the final image. Causality is simple but solid—his methods and beliefs lead directly to the design and to lighting the fuse, and the closure (the hand of fire holding the hearts) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (who, where, when, and what’s at stake). The only reason this isn’t a 9+ is that the cost remains mostly conceptual; the narrative never lets the risk of failure bite quite as hard on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene accumulating pressure through reflection anchored in present stimuli, leading to a decisive on-page choice. Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven—each image of tide, pool, and cicada reweights the central question until the narrator’s stance crystallizes. Closure is a genuine decisive change (“Let us go inland together, and return each summer”) with an embedded cost (splitting life between incompatible worlds) that is legible on the page. There are no orientation issues or broken set-ups, and the reflection never floats free of the live moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense trellis frame, then the past first inversion as hinge, returning to the shared inversion as climax. Causality is intact—early inversion → obsession with silences → father’s challenge and participation → joint repricing of bunkers and fear. Closure is strong: the final image of “new weight” and shared vocabulary is a clear resonant reconfiguration with emotional and conceptual cost. The speculative rule (inversion hour) is introduced organically and used consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: train departs → quiet window opens → Rian enacts his experiment → passengers respond → silence reconfigures from absence to shelter. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens with a clear RR-style closure in “the moment catalyze” and the imagined bridge of breaths. However, the cost of failure or success remains low and mostly implied (no clear consequence if this goes wrong), slightly softening the closure’s weight. Structure is otherwise tight and well-scaled for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dispatch → journey → waterfall/orchard → chapel/paint → ruby → stair/countdown → throne choice, with each step motivated and legible. The closure is strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the “throne” option with visible conceptual cost and redefines the premise to “only memory.” The countdown “ASCEND UNTIL SUNRISE OR BE ERASED FROM POSSIBILITY” adds structural pressure even if not fully exploited moment-to-moment. Very minor weakness: the brief future-vision segment edges toward summary, slightly loosening immediacy without breaking the throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean, with the sanctuary visit progressing from approach to threshold to contact to re-framing of her history. The closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: the realization she’s been arriving here with every departure, and her new way of breathing, reprice the premise with cost. Causality holds under a textural/situational lens: each step into the space and into contact with the keeper deepens pressure. The only limit is that the “lesson” framework flirts with neatness, risking a slightly schematic feel rather than messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that escalates from failing pumps to interdimensional messages to the charged decision at the hatch. Causality under the hybrid/accumulative lens is coherent—world rule → pumps fail → texts warn → hatch responds to her history and choice. The closure as Charged Poise (old lie aligning with new door) lands with a clear before/after and implied cost. The external threat (“promises eating everyone”) stays mostly conceptual rather than concretely tested, keeping it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, anchored quickly in time/place and driving causally from setup (return to library) through method (machine + Mara’s theory) to payoff (recorded council moment). The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sound, memory, and detail layer until the queen’s voice and the ring reconfigure what his abdication meant. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—he re-understands the surrender as flowing from preexisting inner silence—with a real psychic cost. The only shortfall is that the external situation does not change and the before/after is somewhat subtle rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, steadily building from arrival to a decisive stance shift. Causality is clear—Mira’s provocations (the program, the masks, the treason line) lead directly to Calder’s conceptual re-evaluation and final decision. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after in his allegiance and status. The scene is slightly more static and conversational than it might be for the stakes implied, but not enough to damage coherence or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: orientation in the file room, the assignment, her method (dust patterns), then the deepening via visitors, culminating in the brother recognizing the button and a closing recommitment. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each development (discovery of the button, visits, the brother’s story) reweights the stakes of her work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses to continue this emotionally costly work with sharpened purpose. No orientation issues or structural confusion undercut this.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: disappearance of booths → puddle-map discovery → lagoon/booth → archival recording → directive strip and reappearing potential. Causality holds under a Hybrid/accumulative lens—Lio’s attention to erasures enables them to follow the water, which leads to the surviving booth and the new mission. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the world’s rules about erasure and memory are reweighted by the clandestine archive and the instruction to “distribute widely when plans unravel.” The cost is subtle but present as exhaustion and a new, risky obligation rather than an explicit external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine—prophecy accidentally played, deaths, flight, years of attempts, and a final counter-performance—is clean and legible under an accumulative/textural lens. The backstory is well-anchored to present stimuli (sound, mist) and consistently reorients us to the grotto, so there’s no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his new tactic of refusal appears to loosen the future at a conceptual cost (years of burden, now reweighted as “nostalgia for a disaster”). A slightly more explicit sense of what tangible stakes might change for others would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the ritual sorting, monuments, and folklore build to the arrival of the anomalous leaf and the invitation to plant. Causality under the hybrid lens holds—new leaf → voice → revelation about the monuments → decision to plant—and there is a clear before/after in Lio’s stance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Lio shifts from pure decoding to active participation, with the valley’s story beginning anew as an on-page consequence. The cost of that shift (risk of misreading, transformation) is conceptually legible but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the waterfall sound → trapdoor → cavern/compass → greenhouse → choice about time and planning. Structure is essentially two connected scenes (cavern, then greenhouse) that progress under a single drive: Eli’s response to the intrusion of “Perhaps” into his life. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external event, but the internal before/after is legible and feels earned. Stakes remain mostly conceptual, which slightly softens the impact of the structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the foundry → ritual with the coin → vision of Arlen → conceptual redefinition of “Wanderer” and the coin’s transformation. Causality and motivation are coherent, and orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “lost” through the new thirteenth sign, with a felt cost in Eira’s acceptance of an “unclosed” name. The only modest ceiling factor is that external constraints are light, so pressure is almost entirely internal and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean descent-encounter-ascent structure, with each stage of the gorge deepening the core situation. Causality is clear: Mara identifies an imbalance, descends with a plan, engages the harp, and the gorge’s music changes in response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a sharp decisive act, with the world subtly “tilting” toward healing. The cost is somewhat soft (largely emotional and conceptual), but legible in her willingness to bear the dead’s confessions and reshape them.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: wake from anesthesia → orient in impossible forest → discover frame/interface → receive proposition → make a costly choice. The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens, with coherent pressure from the setup (“study” of mercy) narrowing her options toward the frame. Closure lands in a clear Decisive Change as she steps in, with cost and before/after legible. Orientation is strong from line one, and there are no causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival at the market → guided passage through the paintings → acquisition of the lens → retrospective realization and shame. Causality is clear enough within the lyric frame, and the closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing of what translation means. However, the piece stops right at realization; there is no small decisive act in the present to concretize the new stance, which slightly blunts closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early despite the dreamlike world, with no major lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival → inspection → noticing the barrel and dust → ceiling bulge → power cut → touching the barrel → rupture and reveal. Causality holds and the ending offers a clear Conceptual Repricing: ceilings as “treaties” are literally broken, exposing a mirrored death-room and moving machinery. The closure cost is more conceptual than emotional or practical—we feel that something important and dangerous has shifted, but the direct consequences for the protagonist remain offstage. Still, for this length, the decisive change in world-logic and options is well executed.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks a clean causal spine: daily frost-reading → unprecedented pattern and deadline → decision to risk one last page with the whisper → library-wide reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural bias, and the closure (treaties rewriting, reality negotiating) is legible as a conceptual repricing with cost implied in the systemic shake-up. Stakes are clearly framed (rupture vs transcendence), and the ending shows a before/after shift in the library’s rules. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, so rupture remains more threatened than viscerally paid, which keeps this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: shard → hypothesis about the Hourglass → excavation of sealed chambers → interpretive dispute → institutional shutdown → counter-narrative via poems and mirrors → reconfigured final stance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: Mara accepts that official history won’t change but commits to preserving alternate futures, with emotional and institutional cost implicit. Causality is consistent and each move grows logically from the last without outline-y “and then” sequencing. The only ceiling is that external consequences (e.g., concrete risk from defying the Council) remain mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal arc is clean and legible: city’s crisis → summons Elias → descent to chamber → experiment with music box → negotiated rewording of the covenant → restoration of light. The structure is linear, with one main scene and rising density as they move downward and inward, culminating in an on-page decisive change. Closure lands clearly: the clocks resume, morning returns, and the city’s relationship to time/light is reconfigured at a conceptual cost (midnight’s power narrowed, covenant rewritten). If anything, the resolution feels slightly smooth—Elias’s method works on the first attempt with little structural resistance—but it doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: factory shutdown → collecting along the dead rail/ditch → discovery of the compass → visions that redirect his path → cave → lagoon → revelation of the factory’s guarding function. Closure lands as a charged poise: he recognizes the hinge and chooses to proceed toward the ledge with no assurance of safety. The cost is mostly conceptual and anticipatory rather than dramatized, which blunts the impact slightly. Structure (present exploration interleaved with one key backstory shard) is tight and never disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: GPS failure → discovery of the altar/box → revelation of the timewoven image → conceptual re-mapping of the archway and her journey. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—she leaves with no GPS but a reweighted sense of navigation, which clearly marks a before/after. Causality is coherent; each step arises plausibly from the last, with no orientation issues. The cost of that repricing (accepting uncertainty, leaving the “edge of the world” without answers) is present but somewhat under-dramatized in concrete terms, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival → pavilion/postcards → ascent to cathedral → discovery at window → return/closure, with each step causally linked and easy to follow. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but the investigative thread holds, and the window revelation functions as a genuine conceptual turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ira comprehends the glass’s secret role and redirects that knowledge into his own art, which reweights the premise. Cost is mostly conceptual (a new way of seeing and responsibility for it), so the piece reads exquisitely shaped but slightly low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: zeppelin → diary activation → visions → shore messages → kneeling parley → return, with each step causally linked. The accumulative/textural drive (pressure via layered images and messages) holds to the end, and the closure—her articulated terms of witness—constitutes a clear stance shift with conceptual cost. Stakes stay focused on whether she accepts this dangerous mode of witnessing; no major setups are dropped. The only limit is that the external consequences of her vow remain somewhat abstract, keeping the arc just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense contemplation → backstory of the wish and exodus → design experiment → bottle’s response and returning footsteps. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: his shift from “how to open the bottle” to “how to reimagine the town” leads directly to the bottle warming and the implied return of others. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the bottle’s purpose is reinterpreted and the town’s future options are newly framed, with the cost being the renunciation of easy revival. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: arrival → ritual setup → immersion (plus flashback) → revealed content → conceptual reweighting of the archive as accidental prophecy. Causality is clean and the flashback is well-anchored in the current action, informing Lan’s method rather than stalling it. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when Lan recognizes the ancestral oath-scribe and the prophetic nature of such recordings, shifting the meaning of his vocation. However, the cost of this realization is more suggested than felt; we don’t see even a small tactical adjustment or explicit dread in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival → orientation to the atrium and egg → offer and explanation → tactile contact/vision sequence → decision and commitment. Causality is strong under a largely causal lens; each development (“feel it,” touch, vortex visions) directly drives the next, culminating in a Decisive Change and the stated plan to reopen. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after in options and cost. The only minor limitation is that the broader-world stakes remain mostly asserted rather than pressured in-scene, which keeps the plot from feeling fully maximal in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and cohesive: one continuous scene that moves from ascent and setup to a single high-stakes decision point. Causality is tight under a situational lens: data trends → zero hour clause → readings at the cusp → concrete choice to act or abstain. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis in the final image of him listening to the valley instead of pulling, with the cost (risking lives vs corrupting future trust in the siren) made explicit. The only small limitation is that consequences remain entirely prospective; we leave at the crystallized stance rather than seeing any immediate repercussion.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: late shift arrival → discovery of lantern → activation of projections → deepening visions → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is intact and legible under a textural/accumulative lens, and the closure (his promise to keep watching, revaluing his role) lands with a clear before/after. Stakes remain largely internal but are coherently escalated through increasingly charged images and realizations rather than any outline-y sequencing. Cost is present as the ache, exposure, and relinquishing of invisibility, even if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with interleaved backstory, all anchored to the shed and the stained glass box. Causality is quiet but solid: the ghosts’ increasing boldness → Mara’s appearance → opening the box → re-reading the covenant → redefinition of her role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the covenant’s meaning shifts from prison to witness and her choice to “keep it” now carries a newly articulated burden. Stakes and time are modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with no orientation or lens ambiguity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: job → observation of the urn → garage-sale experiment → discovery of the leak → decision to “teach the town how to float” → final conceptual reweighting. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each new realization grows logically from the prior image or experiment. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, reframing “borrowed time” with a clear before/after in understanding and a charged final tableau of the waiting townsfolk. Stakes remain abstract (no concrete crisis point if the leak continues), which keeps the escalation from feeling fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric lens: kite → snapped string → feather → discord → song → being → gift/realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he now experiences discord as companionship, with the feather as lasting token. Orientation is excellent and the single-scene flow is coherent. The cost—accepting unfixable incompletion—is subtle but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: diagnosis → decision to remodel → copper network → birds’ unintended circuits → lightning → pillars unlocking → monks guided through a newly reconfigured space → death. Structure is accumulative but each beat deepens options and knowledge rather than meandering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the island’s systems are now in dialogue, with his death as visible cost and the orchard’s new function unmistakably different from the starting state. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds from midpoint to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ascent/arrival at the tower, descent along the sculpture path, and arrival at the spiral clearing, each deepening the conceptual stakes of “homecoming.” Causality is coherent (assignment → path → footprints multiplying → conceptual realization → charged waiting), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural leading to a Charged Poise ending. The closure beat—the narrator standing in the spiral, waiting to see if the “chemistry of homecoming” begins with thunder or bronze quiet—reconfigures what homecoming and the alien gift mean, with a felt conceptual cost of remaining in “almost.” The only limitation is that the on-page cost is intellectual rather than dramatized, so the before/after shift, while clear, is more cerebral than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one twilight visit framed by backstory that’s well-anchored in present actions (harbor descent, seed placement, final pod). Causality is soft but coherent: the botanist’s past instructions → his ongoing ritual → current precise seed placement guided by birds → reweighted vision of future garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, not a decisive change, but the before/after (ongoing tending vs. clarified, “accurate” vision of reclamation) is legible and paid for. Escalation is modest yet present as he moves to the fiercest war point and places the “final pod” of the night.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: stranger arrives with a dangerous object, they listen, the experience reconfigures their understanding, and they choose a stance at the end. Causality is solid and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each revelation tightens the emotional frame toward the decision to preserve and share. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: they reject both erasure and safety, embracing a risk-laden communal reckoning. The only limitation is that external consequences remain largely conceptual rather than concretely posed on the page, slightly softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: arrival, reactivation of the deck, observation, sketching, reflection, and a crystallizing final line. Causality is coherent (his pariah role enables access; the shutdown and dilation scar define the stakes), and orientation is strong from the outset. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he reconceives “true north” under the pressure of a sky that refuses to stay fixed. The cost—choosing this warped, dangerous vantage as his guiding reference—is felt, though the escalation to that choice remains mostly tonal rather than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ascent culminating in the bargain and opening of the lid, with no causality breaks. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural—the wrong sky, the code, the chess pieces—and culminates in a conceptual repricing of what it means to “steal the future.” Closure is strong: the final choice to lift the lid and be “written anew” is decisive and carries felt cost. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and what she wants are legible early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear and controlled: present-tense work in the gallery, interleaved with crisply anchored backstory, all feeding the single throughline of what to do with the narrator’s experience and the citizens’ whispers. The global drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the density of gestures, games, and rumors builds until the rumor of closure and the pawn imagery converge. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the narrator decides to “teach the floor itself to remember,” reweighting every prior walk and whisper with cost and purpose. The before/after—private notebook vs. embodied, secret public archive under an incoming regime—is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb to bookstore → descent via map → discovery of stone → internal confrontation → spoken reversal. Causality under a textural lens holds throughout; each fantastical element is a “because/therefore” extension of the premise rather than random ornament. Closure lands sharply when the narrator recognizes forgetting as burial and chooses to speak, a Resonant Reconfiguration with a conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is clear from early on (who/where/what this place is), so no structural debt drags the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: frozen village → mayor’s plea → tower → tapestry → thread-decoding → temporal release, with the labyrinth reveal as the central structural pivot. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with accumulative lyric shading, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change plus internal reconfiguration. Stakes and cost are more emotional/conceptual than dramatized danger—he never comes close to failing—but they are legible. Structure is tight and single-scene with no orientation issues or rule-breaking late twists.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: an eerie approach, entry into Zev’s chamber, the refracting session, then the descent toward the spire. Causality is coherent—ritual rules force the night with Zev; her confession leads to the refracted truths; that work reconfigures her approach to the spire—and the orientation is strong from the first lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from singular verdict-seeking to carrying multiple, conflicting selves toward judgment, with a visible conceptual cost. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the final choice remains contemplative rather than tested under explicit on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and charged: belief in the statue as script → construction/use of the glass lung → descent → vision → crack → narration that seals the fracture. The story maintains single-scene continuity with no orientation debt, and every step follows as a “because/therefore” rather than an “and then.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Corin’s understanding of his purpose and methods is permanently reweighted, at visible cost (near-death, damage to the apparatus). Nothing crucial is resolved offstage or by coincidence; the world’s persistent pressures (rising acid sea, fragility of the workshop) remain intact at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: broken mirror → decision → journey → cave discovery → painting → return, with a clear before/after driven by his kept promise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration when he leaves with the painting and seashell, having finally enacted his vow. Causality is sound and there are no orientation issues; the fork, cave, and alternative exit all track. The main limitation is that the danger of the caves and tides remains largely conceptual, so the sense of cost at closure is more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the end of the heat wave, with a clear build from exposition → preparation → magical act → outcome → quiet coda. Causality holds (heat → sea’s exhaustion → Jorah’s shouting → Mara’s alternative method → altered beam → boats’ response) and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the lighthouse’s function is repriced from command to welcome. Cost is present but understated: she quietly overturns protocol and risks lives without on-page pushback. Escalation and closure are solid but not quite searing in consequence, which keeps this below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: hydraulics fail → analog-only station → midnight call → mapping through the call → decision to offer a ruinous “home” and parallel internal release. Causality is lyrical but coherent—each step grows from the prior image or constraint (loss of power enabling this illicit, analog map-making). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the stakes shift from literally finding a surviving chapel to creating a passage through loss, with cost acknowledged. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent throughout, and the final image of Mara walking along an imagined road crystallizes the before/after without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: orientation is clear early (ravine/orchard/empathy virus), and the beats—arrival, weeks of work, deepening with Risa, climactic storm—build cleanly to the eye’s conceptual repricing. The closure lands: realizing the “relic” is a mirror they agreed to fear reweights everything that came before and shifts options from magical cure to honest mutual witnessing. Some middle material (“So we worked together...”) compresses what could be dramatized, slightly softening causal sharpness and felt cost. Still, the through-line from mapping fungi to storm-night revelation is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: arrival → uncanny recognition → revelation of the drowned man’s instructions → reframing of investigation → transfer of the Edelweiss. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Situational, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator assumes the waiting role, with a conceptual cost. Causality is intact if quiet, though the investigator’s institutional stakes (“write it down, file it away, forget it”) never visibly test their job in the scene. The piece earns its ending without needing additional plot turns, but one sharper on-page consequence for the narrator’s choice would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story is tightly structured as a single, continuous progression from shop to cavern to doorway, with clear causal and situational pressure (following the ants → cavern → rising creek → doorway choice). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the rules of the world (chip, undecided stone, doorway) emerge through action. Closure lands as a decisive change—Elias chooses to step through the faint, risky path—framed as irrevocably ending his long avoidance of choice. The cost is legible in his envisioned retreat vs. unknown future and the rising water that forecloses delay.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: recurring dreams → decision to ride → refusal to delay for the storm → arrival at the grotto → confrontation with the starlight that reconfigures her past. The global drive is Hybrid (causal quest + accumulative imagery), and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration/incipient decisive change as she “remembered.” Stakes about the sky bleeding out are mostly conceptual and never concretely tested, so the world-scale threat feels slightly abstract at this length. Nonetheless, there is a clear before/after in knowledge and options by the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense scene at the nexus, interleaved with a single, well-anchored flashback that clearly arises from stimulus and feeds the current stakes. The causal chain is modest but coherent: Lio’s past overhearing → his pocket-sun project → present malfunction → Kira and Jash arrive with shell and news → request for an imprint → Lio’s conceptual pivot at the end. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act, but the before/after in his purpose is legible and carries cost because “leave” has just been introduced as a real possibility. Some readers may want one more concrete beat of decision or tactical change, but under an accumulative/lyric lens, the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: wake → recollection and job context → grave memory as inciting fracture → present decision to confront it by going out and soaring over the cemetery → stance crystallization. Causality is legible under a textural lens: each remembered or described event tightens his current pressure rather than feeling like digressive lore. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise in the last line, reweighting the entire narrative as the origin story of a narrator who has “spoiled every ending.” The only thing keeping this short of elite is that escalation remains mostly reflective rather than forcing a sharper before/after in his practical options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/situational arc: a client arrives, an object of grief is presented, Mara proposes a non-literal “repair,” and the act reweights his relationship to time. Causality is tight at this scale—each move (letting him stay an outline, handling the screw, altering the clock) follows from the last and narrows his options from paralysis to a specific ritualized stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in “It does not fix her absence, but it humanizes the time that follows” and his acceptance of partial clarity. There are no orientation issues or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene with two major beats (two living runes) and a closing descent, under an accumulative/textural drive. Each rune arises causally from a specific superstition-memory, and each changes Lan’s stance, leading to the final realization that this is “only a breath between storms” but he will meet future ones differently. Orientation is excellent from the opening (“tea platform… above the cloud sea,” Lan kneeling), and world rules (tea defying gravity, talismans, tethering chains) stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a clear before/after in how his scars function in his life, with the cost legible in the relinquished superstitions.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight: arrival → descent into archive → ritual via perfume and metaphors → confession and send; each step feels causally motivated by the email and her private agenda. The closure is a clear Decisive Change—she publishes a self‑incriminating column instead of safe advice—and that choice has conceptual and reputational cost on the page. The orchard’s impending demolition and the archive glitches provide a temporal and situational frame that accumulates pressure without confusion. A minor limitation is that the “exorcism” consequences (for Liora, the archive, or town) remain mostly conceptual, so external stakes resolve more as implication than dramatized outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure from pacing the stacks to discovering the chamber to enacting the ritual is clean, with each step logically arising from the last under the “spiral arbitration” concept. The closure—multiple histories braiding into one, the library unifying with the world—lands clearly as a decisive change with conceptual cost (erasure of alternate timelines in their separate forms). Causality is intact and orientation (who/where/when) is established early through the temple, the hiccuping universe, and the library’s function. The only limitation is that the stakes and costs remain somewhat abstract rather than tied to any concrete, dramatized loss beyond the conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival, deviation to the roof, counting ritual, visionary sequence, conceptual realization, and a concrete final choice. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: the found key → disturbed dreams → rooftop vantage → counting backwards → vision of the station → understanding the key’s function → refusal. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the path of becoming “as regular as the tide tables” and accepts ongoing doubt. The cost is on-page in the articulation of what using the key would do to him.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: surveillance → conversation with Rae → descent to dock → opening the door, with a brief backstory interlude that clearly reorients the present stakes. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: the repeated non-breaches and the job history accumulate until the present group at the dock plus Rae’s intervention precipitate a Decisive Change. Closure is strong—the override and opening reconfigure the model with visible internal cost—but the on-page sense of concrete consequences beyond that charged moment is muted. Orientation is excellent from the first few lines; there are no temporal or spatial confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative mosaic: library → archives → subway → hospital, each shard causally linked and thematically tightening around risk and interpretation. Orientation is impeccable; we always know where and when we are, and the heart attack frames the entire “before/after” drive. Closure lands when she reframes the odds on the back of his note, a Conceptual Repricing that crystallizes their shared language with visible emotional cost. Every major setup (probability, gambling, the note, subway scrawls) is paid off without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight and legible: a calm opening, brief backstory loop about her “true job,” then the Line Four call that plays as inciting incident, decision engine, and resolution all in one. Causality is clean under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—Lena’s established pattern of reshaping endings leads directly to the tactical use of the flickering lamp and Mara’s decision to call her sister. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the affair’s loop is conceptually broken, and the final image of the tunnel as “bridge” reweights the entire premise with a felt cost in Lena’s ongoing solitude. The only limitation is scale—pressure and consequences are small and quiet, which is fine, but they never quite feel indispensable or dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: festival aftermath → ritual preparation → footprints → Mara’s emergence → charged exchange → return to writing, all under one coherent drive of invoking and renewing the covenant. Causality is clear within the lyric frame—steeping the photo and writing at the right tidal “context change” produces the visitation, which then reconfigures the archivist’s stance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: her work is no longer only personal penance but acknowledged covenant-renewal, with an increased emotional price. Orientation is clean from the opening and the story stays within a single, continuous scene enriched (not derailed) by backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival → revelation of the moon rock and oath → proposal of the experiment → communal confessions that reconfigure the initial problem. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: because Kenji won’t hoard the rock, he brings it to the Exchange; because Mara proposes the experiment, the platform’s people disclose truths that shift the nature of loneliness. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—“until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared”—with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the cost and consequences of this experiment are more implied than tested; nothing in the present scene substantially threatens to go wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative journey: pause in the sky → compass activation → deepening forest immersion → voices of the past → stillpoint clearing and internal reconfiguration. Orientation is strong early: we know who he is, where he’s going, and what the pause is. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise decision to redirect his mapping inward, with the cost (deferred external seeking and confrontation with pain) legible. There are no causality breaks; each new layer (languages, notes, voices) logically follows the last.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is elegantly accumulative: quiet setup, discovery of the pen, first revision of the brother incident as hinge, then a widening series of edits culminating in a reweighted final stance. Causality is clean under the premise—the anomaly deepening and cosmic shifts register as consistent consequences of his revisions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts dying there, still revising within constraints, with an on-page sense of cost and inevitability. The lyric telescoping of many revisions into “night after artificial night” is compressed but legible and does not feel like a cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival at the harbor → ritual framed by the advisor → signing/mapping silence → internal “listening” and reconfiguration. Causality within the lyrical frame holds—each step follows persuasively from Lena’s stated desire and the advisor’s instructions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she confronts painful memories and gains a new way of “hearing” her life, crystallized in the last two sentences. The only limitation is that the external situation remains almost entirely static, so structural tension relies almost wholly on interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → exploration → pattern of vandalism → self-portrait revelation → tapestry and promise translation → resolved stance to preserve. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens: each discovered object narrows interpretation until the final reconfiguration of the narrator’s past act and present purpose. Closure is strong: choosing to remain in the archive and “stitching my days” is a clear after-state with cost (continued isolation, permanent renunciation of prior life). The only reason this doesn’t reach 9+ is that the arson’s practical consequences and any remaining external pressures are kept off-stage, keeping the pressure mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene where each move (garden → lagoon → reflection → realization → signal) flows causally and escalates conceptually. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a causal spine, culminating in a conceptual repricing: the Chorus project’s purpose is reweighted when she decides to subvert it. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/CR—the final image of open sky and chosen song redraws the experiment as a battleground for collective agency. The cost is mostly inferred (future punishment, loss of self) rather than concretely dramatized in the final beat, which moderates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: storm knocks out systems, inspectors get lost, Milo uses his idiosyncratic tools to find them, and Ramos’s stance shifts. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the story moves in a single, legible arc with no dropped setups. Closure lands as a conceptual/relational reconfiguration—Ramos “hearing” the lesson—rather than a decisive external change, which suits the piece. The main weakness is that the solution feels almost too frictionless; there’s little sense that Milo might fail or need to adapt once his plan is in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: backstory error → entrenched regret → present-night signaling via shutters and reflections → phone call as decisive act. Structure is linear and legible, with the guardian’s long listening history feeding directly into tonight’s more active role. Closure is on-page and costly for the dentist (breaking secrecy to seek repair), while the guardian’s watch shifts subtly but clearly. Stakes remain intimate rather than expansive, but they are fully proportionate to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine—from Daniel hearing unspoken fears to conceiving the window-forest, organizing the town, and the vote reversal—is clean and satisfying. The accumulative lyric texture (repeated quiet, mist, unspoken words) supports rather than obscures that through-line. Closure lands clearly with the council’s changed vote and the town’s “different future,” followed by a resonant return to the grotto. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral but legible: a near-permanent reconfiguration of the town’s trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: meet-ritual setup on the dock, journey to the island, culminating in the listening act, all under a single coherent lens (accumulative with situational pressure). Causality is tight—each beat arises logically from the previous (the invitation, Mara’s return, the row, the bone at her ear). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the island/whale magic reframes self-repression as the true disappearing landmass. The primary limitation is that the tangible consequences of this realization remain mostly conceptual rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single scene that moves from arrival-at-table to carving to departure, each step causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Mara chooses to allow a non-mandated easing and the performer leaves the “remade hush” behind, with the Mandate’s pressure still intact. Stakes and world rules (Happiness Mandate, surveillance turbines) are coherently set and never contradicted. The pressure remains mostly low-key and could use one sharper on-page test of danger to reach higher.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural design: single scene, one continuous approach → speech → release pattern, with backstory woven in via concrete triggers. Causality is coherent (ban → burning → reopening → invitation → subversive response), and orientation is strong from the first lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lio accepts speaking again but on his own terms, explicitly discarding the sanctioned frame and revaluing the “sacred boundaries” as fear-based. The cost—risking renewed disfavor, refusing reconciliation—is implied rather than tested on-page, which keeps the structural effect strong but not fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: phoenix aftermath → stranger’s proposal → painting trance → release/bloom, with each beat causally linked. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal spine (reed’s note → Mira’s process → silence/bloom) remains legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the unforgivable sound is recontextualized into something bearable via the painting. Stakes and cost stay somewhat abstract and interior, keeping this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear arc from solitary preparation through interruption to a new mode of pilgrimage. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: Elya’s doubt → questioning assumptions → altered bell sequence → visitor’s arrival → choice to proceed without a map. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Elya reframes her role and steps into the lattice “not pilgrims and guide, but two questions,” with a before/after that is legible. Stakes and costs are modest and mostly internal, which slightly limits the punch despite the elegance of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: introduction of the observatory and intention apparatus, establishment of Ela’s grief and task, the repetitive labor of placing birds, then the meteor event that reconfigures everything. Causality is solid under a textural lens—her earlier choices seed the later illumination—without resorting to mechanical plotting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices “rock bottom” and redirects her craft toward blooming rather than only mourning, with a tangible new series as evidence. The meteor shower is a bit of a cosmic gift, but it functions as intensifier rather than unearned solution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: solitary ritual → interruption (buzzer) → interrogation of her project → reveal that the pattern implicates their relationship → mutual decision to map together. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the measuring tape is physically reoriented to lie between them, shifting her work from solitary, abstract mapping to a shared, personally costly experiment. Stakes are conceptual and emotional rather than plot-heavy, but the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: descent → encounter with pagoda → doctrinal choice about randomness → progressive opening of doors → final conceptual and practical vow. Orientation is excellent from the first lines, and the accumulative structure of memories is easy to track. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis, with Hiran’s decision to remain below and carry the unbearable patterns constituting a real before/after. The only shortfall from top tier is that the external apocalypse stakes remain largely offstage and abstract, rather than tested within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: dusk change → alarm about an unbound shadow → descent into the analog layer → encounter with Lane’s shadow → Lio’s decision to become a moving archive. Causality is coherent and legible, with no orientation issues; each step flows naturally from the last. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing, with a clear before/after in Lio’s role and a felt emotional cost. The only reason this doesn’t touch 9+ is that the external consequences of unbound shadows remain somewhat abstract, keeping the structural stakes more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single present-time scene anchored by a purposeful reflective block that directly informs the central choice. Causality is sound—Liora comes to Mara to “reconstruct,” the offer regarding the tail forces a concrete decision, and the final hanging-at-the-crossroads plan reframes her path forward. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her internal stance shifts from hoarding goodness to exposing it publicly with cost. Nothing critical is left dangling, yet the future remains appropriately open.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a tight single scene with accumulative pressure: waking after surgery → realizing the side effect → testing the coffee-ring anomaly → reconceiving her purpose. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, with each object (ivy, hourglass, ring) adding a layer that culminates in the final realization about closure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her role in relation to trauma, with a clear before/after in her self-conception. Costs—loss of her old method, acceptance of a stranger “miracle”—are implicit but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → touch/reading → projection → realization, all causally legible under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—unused love as deleted scenes—and the final choice to see her letters as “unfinished reels” gives a clear before/after. There are no orientation issues; the palace, booth, and sequence of actions are easy to follow. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized in a difficult choice, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: murmurs → climb to archway → activation of astrolabe → tunnel of aurora → release of ideas into the valley → emptied but oriented narrator. Cause-and-effect is coherent under a textural/lyric lens, with each magical move grounded in a prior image or rule (spirals, stardust, falling stars). Closure is strong: a clear before/after in the narrator’s burden and the world’s imaginative weather, with a visible conceptual and emotional cost. Structure is single-scene and tight; nothing vital is left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: from burned world → empty guarding → discovery/use of the chess clock → recognition of divergent tracks → active cultivation and singing, all under one continuous present-tense frame. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the quantum/weird elements are taught gradually in ways that pay off at the close. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator embraces a charged stasis as witness/singer to wave-function “cargo,” with clear cost in unending vigilance and loneliness. The through-line motive and the final image (“Whatever listens… must hear me through wave functions, not words, yet I sing anyway”) bind the piece into a legible before/after without needing causal plot lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine—strange awakenings → mechanical rainforest → platform and mercury → missing tooth → inserting the pocket gear → vision—reads cleanly, and the story lands on a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: accepting the wild frontier of the mind. The accumulative structure of reflection and scene is coherent and supports that ending. However, the closure’s cost is mostly implied; it’s not clear what this act forecloses or risks beyond a vague sense of transformation. The doctors/setup thread is also dropped rather than reweighted at the end, slightly thinning structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clear: we move from the guides’ vigil to Mara’s inciting rupture at dinner, flight, arrival, and descent, with clean causal links under an accumulative/lyric lens. The closure—a conceptual crossing as she reaches the inner “shore” and the star answers—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an implied before/after. Stakes are emotionally legible but mostly inferred; the external consequences of refusing the shop aren’t revisited after the opening setup. Still, the piece meets the required closure standard without major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is strong: anomalous bolt → guest’s arrival → forbidden staircase → recovered memory of coerced silence → explicit dilemma → spoken word that triggers destruction. Orientation is clear early, even with the surreal rules, and the single scene-plus-memory structure remains coherent. Closure is an on-page decisive change with tangible cost (physical shattering, loss of the “heaven of locked doors”) that reconfigures the premise. Nothing crucial is resolved offstage or by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is accumulative: the titan seeds messages → books slip through time → a scholar eventually reads the pattern and has her certainty broken. Causality is clean under a textural lens (no confusion about who/where/when; the “pause of shifting constellations” and library rules are well taught and exploited), and the final image of realization is a clear closure unit (conceptual repricing/charged poise). The main limitation is that the decisive change is largely conceptual and occurs in the scholar with little sense of immediate consequence beyond internal doubt, so the cost is felt but somewhat distant. Still, the piece delivers a coherent before/after in knowledge and possibility without structural stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: anomalies → atlas page → private testing of rhythm → subtle but undeniable ocean response. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new datum pushes the narrator from passive monitoring toward an experimental, quasi-ritual act, and the closure beat (horizon bending, sandbar glimpse) clearly reconfigures what the rules of this world might be. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and personal, but there is a legible before/after in how the ocean’s behavior is understood. No orientation or lens-clarity debts appear.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous scene where backstory and present are tightly interleaved, always anchored by concrete cues (stones humming, bay details). The global drive lens is Accumulative/Situational—the pressure is the lull itself—and the ending lands a Charged Poise: before she’s a solitary observer, after she’s reopened the channel with a specific invitation. Causality is soft but coherent: her sensory engagement with the stones and memory directly precipitates the decision. The cost is implied rather than dramatized (we don’t see direct danger or consequence), which keeps this short of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: plant-telepathy → embryo discovery → kite decoding → ritual → council arrival → choice to unseal destiny utterly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: instead of restoring a designed heir, they destroy the blueprint and let destiny diffuse into the springs, with a clear conceptual cost (forfeiting the last controllable “solution”). The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with an accumulative lyric overlay) and holds consistently through the end. The only limitation is that the late-arriving council opposition feels more gestural than fully dramatized, so the climax’s external pressure is a bit underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense arboretum frame, interleaved backstory, and a closing beat where her stance toward memory and future subtly but decisively shifts. Causality operates under a textural lens: being in this specific place leads to reflection, which leads to the notebook list, which enables the closing act of folding and keeping the photo while walking out. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she accepts lasting damage yet moves toward tomorrow—and the cost (ongoing trauma, no fantasy of full recovery) is clear. Orientation (who/where/rough when) is established early and never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: library → tarot box → occult book → re-laying the deck → realization → physical descent. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each new object/action deepens the same central drive rather than introducing side threads. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he decides the next portraits will be “possible selves,” which reweights all prior images and tarot work. Stakes and cost are more emotional than situational, but the before/after is legible and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: eclipse aftermath → summons to the Painted Table → ink experiment → conceptual turn about time “skipping” → offer to step between cuts → Iren’s accepting gesture. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/conceptual) lens, and closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing, with his future options reconfigured by his new role as someone who can “disappear and return.” The external frame (raiders, herds) is mostly scaffolding, but it effectively seeds the phenomenon the ink then explicates. The cost of potential self-erasure is implicit but legible in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: anomalous alert → discovery of the letter → reading → ethical dilemma → decision to transmit rather than burn, with each step narrowing her options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/decisive change: Ana commits to quiet rebellion, with falsified records and networked dissemination locking in a before/after. Stakes and cost are legible—risk of exposure and treason—without needing external confrontation. Structure is linear and clean; one might want a slightly sharper on-page brush with immediate consequences, but for this length the pressure is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative: the fall of the tower sets the frame, then we move through Mara’s method, visitors, and the farm’s shifting reputation, culminating in raiders turned workers and the final charged image of continuity under the cracked dome. Causality is soft but legible—her practices lead to a neutral sanctuary, which shapes others’ behavior—and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise where her chosen path has visible effects. Stakes remain mostly conceptual (what values survive, whether the farm stays neutral) and there’s no sharp on-page turning point, just a smooth deepening. For a lyric piece this works, but a slightly clearer single decisive beat would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: the poled approach, the spiral of constellations, the voicing of silence, and the arrival of the echo progress in a tight because/therefore chain. The closure beat—refusing to ask and letting the question dissolve—lands as an Earned Stasis/RR with clear cost (forfeiting the one unanswerable answer) and a visible before/after in the sea’s new rhythms. Orientation and rules of the world are taught early and obeyed; no set-up is abandoned. The only minor limitation is that external stakes remain largely conceptual rather than on-page social or relational, which keeps the frame a touch hermetic.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: the call delivers new evidence, Elena tests it via her father’s professed principle, and that logical/emotional process leads to the decision to publish. Structure holds to a single, continuous scene anchored in the observatory, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a decisive change—she chooses exposure over complicity—with a clear conceptual and emotional cost. The only minor limitation is that external consequences remain off-page, keeping the structural impact primarily conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: present-tense scene in the lab with interleaved, tightly relevant backstory that clearly motivates why answering the monitor matters. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens is strong—job → haunted firmware → baby-cry manifestation → failsafe note → voicemail sacrifice—and closure lands when she offers the “truest sound,” reconfiguring her relationship to the lab and her grief. Cost is legible on the page: she risks letting the firmware consume the last intact artifact of her brother’s voice. A hairline limit is that the mechanics and lasting consequence of the tethering (what exactly happens to the firmware and her ongoing role) remain somewhat impressionistic rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene where picking up the shard triggers a causal chain—heightened perception, focus on the boy, the risky interjection, and the choice to draw with the tile in the mandala. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pressure accruing via ritual, silence, and whispers until the conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is clear and on-page: Lark reinterprets both grotto and art, then acts in line with that new understanding. Stakes remain intimate and could be made more sharply legible in terms of explicit taboo or consequences, but the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from Laleh’s walk through ruins to the pillar, the tessera-triggered retrocognition, and then the renaming ritual that reconfigures the city’s relationship to the fire. Causality holds—tessera → visions → understanding retrocognitive trap → deliberate renaming—and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing with on-page effects (“the air had lost its metallic tension,” people emerging softer). The drive lens (hybrid with a strong textural/lyric component) remains consistent and the single scene window is spatially and temporally legible. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized—emotional or social fallout of her act is implied rather than confronted—but still felt enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric drive: orientation (seaside theater, hedge maze, orchard, ghost) is clear early, and the movement from entrance → approach → proposal → agreement is coherent. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: they commit to attempting the encore-reweaving, reconfiguring the stakes from decay to risky renewal. Causality is intentionally light; “the Wheel can turn once more” hinges on magic logic we accept but don’t fully understand, so the price and mechanics of success/failure stay abstract. This keeps the structure elegant but prevents a higher score where cost and consequence would be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: shock → lingering ability → joint attempt to aim it → partial success and reframing as tool. Structure holds as a single scene with one interior excursion, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Eli accepts an ongoing constraint and a new way to work with it. Cost (he still carries the echoes; nothing is “fixed”) is present but understated. The piece leans slightly toward accumulative/lyric in the middle, yet the drive lens remains coherent enough not to damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean accumulative descent: corridor → cavern → chamber → hidden pool, each step introducing new information (villagers’ traces, children’s sorrow, the non-human spiral) that reweights what Iri is doing. Closure lands as a charged poise: Iri formally addresses the unknown and offers the fossilized comfort-object, crystallizing their mediating role. Causality is coherent and orientation never wavers. The primary limitation is that the global drive feels more contemplative than pressured, so the final turn is resonant but not sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous heist-like scene with a clear before (closed, humming cliffs; prophecy fixed) and after (echo freed to reconfigure confiscated relics and future prophecies). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: years of mapping → finding the crate → opening the jar → reinterpretation of the prophecy → decision to spill the echo. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the function of prophecy in this world is reweighted from law to possibility, with implied social cost. The main limitation is that opposition remains largely off-stage, so the on-page sense of risk is more implied than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: arrival at Zephyr Bluff → investigation of the station and snow field → decoding and discovery of the second pillbox → internal reconfiguration and chosen stasis. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; every step from Mara’s code to the snow patterns to the cache feels motivated, and orientation is solid from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing, with the key and the choice to wait reweighting his understanding of courage and loyalty. If anything, the external stakes remain relatively low-key, which slightly softens the sense of structural urgency at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: the waiting, arrival, boarding, inward question, and crossing build one continuous pressure toward a quiet but clear reconfiguration at the end. Causality is clean—each step (the skiff’s approach, his habitual pause, touching the needle, asking “What do you carry?”) leads plausibly to the next, and the closure moment where he integrates the mother’s plea against all prior promises lands with a discernible emotional cost. Orientation is excellent from the opening (coachman, fog, river crossing, village on hill) and never wavers. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the external plot remains very minimal, heavily reliant on lyric modulation rather than any bolder structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → orientation with glass → visions of alternate timelines → ethical insight → active seeding of the oasis → charged final walk. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: using the glass and circling at a specific time directly enables the revelations that change his stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses a path of ongoing kindness with awareness of its stakes, and the final image of sprouts leaning toward his hands marks a clear before/after. The only limitation is that external stakes and concrete obstacles are muted, keeping the narrative more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean present-moment scene braided with a single, well-anchored backstory thread that directly informs the climax. Causality is modest but coherent: the last petal’s fall, the barge’s moonlight, and the memory of her father all lead to Mara’s decision to reconfigure the garden. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she commits to “small, improbable safeties” with her vulnerability as the guard. There are no orientation issues, and the reflective density never fully stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Lio brings the sundial to the circle, aligns it, summons the prior self, and the conversation leads to a changed stance and a new relationship to the library. The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive but the “because/therefore” links (reincarnation memory → journey to library → sundial alignment → apparition → choice) are legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: isolation is re-priced as material rather than sentence, with the persistent constraint (extinction, solitude) still in force. Stakes remain mostly internal and thematic, but for this length they are coherent and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single-scene lyric spiral: arrival → briefing → contemplation of fragments → composition → handoff and inner shift. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: the storm produces the nest, which prompts the commission, which triggers the narrator’s reckoning with her archive. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, but the before/after—knotted vs. slightly unknotted—reads clearly with cost. Reflection is well-anchored in present stimuli (objects, smells, rain) so momentum never fully stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: station politics and Void behavior layer toward Mara’s decision to “interfere” and the Void’s answer. Causality is coherent—admin decision → campus unrest → altered signal → Mara’s tactical response—under a Hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final swell confirms contact and reweights earlier “game” language with real stakes. The cost is mostly conceptual (ceding attention and leverage to tricksters) rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: childhood story → obsession → journey during fallow period → compass-guided corridor choice → activation of the organ mechanism → emergence of the staircase and charged decision to descend. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural layer, and closure lands as a clear Charged Poise: he accepts descent, with the implied cost that “the key might change him first.” There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored immediately and maintained. The only limitation is that external consequences of his quest remain abstract, keeping stakes mostly personal rather than widening the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is clear and coherent: a single, anchored scene with interleaved backstory that always hooks back to present action. The drive is accumulative/textural—each detail about his work and the case thickens the atmosphere more than it advances linear plot. Closure lands as a Charged Poise with the stone slip and both characters turning, reweighting the preceding quiet as possibly watched, but the cost and consequence remain mostly conceptual. That restraint works, but the final beat could carry a slightly sharper sense of before/after to hit top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the crest → decoding Tamar’s role and the exile protocol → confrontation with the director’s “officially” → Liora’s decision to overwrite the record as closure. The drive is largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the station as layered exile and of data as leverage. Cost is present but quiet—Liora remains trapped in the drenched station, choosing resistance from within rather than escape. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, but escalation stays mostly intellectual and emotional rather than situationally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: hitchhiker’s refusal → disappearance → arrival at the pullout → glass flake’s appearance → decision to play differently → shattering → hitchhiker’s return. The drive lens reads as Hybrid leaning Causal, with accumulative lyric density supporting a clear because/therefore chain of action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the hitchhiker is physically back and accepts the seat, and the world’s possibilities are subtly reweighted (“a soft residue of yes where never used to be”) with felt emotional cost. No orientation issues; time and space remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: present visit to the train, threaded with the father’s past and the startup’s arc, converging on a final conceptual repricing of “inheritance as destiny.” Causality is stable—investors walk, Lila sends her message, he returns to the circus train, lays out the bills, and reframes their meaning. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with discernible cost (recognizing his repetition of inherited patterns). The piece remains reflective rather than decisively active, but within a lyric frame the structural turn is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story is tightly structured as a single night’s scene framed by concise backstory, with each step—arrival, explanation, setup, mapping, realization—logically building on the last. The causal spine (strange telegram → institutional doubt → observatory assignment → star-correlation → catastrophic ledger → reframed understanding of suffering) is coherent and satisfying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the temple’s purpose and the narrator’s function are re-weighted into a model of shared burdens and personal healing, with a clear before/after in the narrator’s stance. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and emotional, but they are legible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time ritual at the lake, a single embedded flashback to the failed trick, then a deepening investigation that culminates in the seed reveal and his counter-confession. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—his expanding-circles method leads to the orchard, to the seed, and to understanding why the lake froze. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the nature of the “failure” and the confession are reweighted, with the final spoken reversal cracking the ice. The cost is more implied than dramatized; we don’t yet see concrete consequences of what breaking that stasis will do.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a clear causal thread: Lio brings the clipping, they link scars, vision reveals the stakes, culminating in his “We cannot cut or keep it.” Closure lands as a Charged Poise: their binary is reconfigured rather than resolved, and the cost of indecision is legible in the futures shown. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational ethical dilemma + accumulative vision imagery) and holds consistently. A slightly clearer articulation of what Lio’s proposed third stance might entail would strengthen the sense of decisive structural reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: arrival → confession → ritual → cost, with each step causally motivated and easy to follow. The catacomb orchard’s rules are learned through action (the altar’s channels, the roots’ response), and the bartered-destiny premise is dramatized rather than explained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lio visibly pays a price to alter the narrator’s internal state, making a before/after legible. The only limitation is that the “deal mechanics” remain slightly impressionistic, trading a bit of tactical specificity for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal-accumulative: present appraisal work triggers memories, which build to the recognition of “his” amp and culminate in the revised catalog copy. Closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing—history and personal meaning over monetary provenance—with an implied cost (letting go of external validation). The backstory is interleaved with present cues and never fully stalls the frame. The only slight weakness is that the decisive turn is more reflective than confrontational, keeping the escalation relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: arrival context → guide’s transformation → seed experiment → arbor’s response → final charged choice, all under a coherent causal chain. The closure beat (“Let us reestablish what you have already taken”) lands as a clear Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts engagement with the arbor but refuses a simple repetition of the guide’s fate. Cost is present (risk to self, relinquishing pure personal glory), though it remains somewhat conceptual rather than concretely dramatized. Orientation is excellent from the opening; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: world premise → problem (abandoned creel of selves) → encounter with fisherman → smelting and reweaving → altered departure. Causality is clear within the surreal frame, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the fisherman’s stance toward endless yesterdays changes with a visible price (accepting his contradictions). The time-rule about tomorrow’s disappearance is cleanly folded into his complaint about “woke up, and it was yesterday again,” giving the premise narrative bite. The only mild weakness is that the global mystery of “tomorrow” remains backgrounded rather than slightly tightening the local choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → revelation of the pearl and shells → invitation to confess → confession → reweighted exit. Under a largely accumulative/situational lens, each new detail narrows Mara toward a stance on what bunkers really do to people. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she still marks it safe, but her understanding of safety, tombs, and human hearts has shifted at clear emotional cost. The piece remains mostly static in external action, but that’s appropriate to its lyric mode and doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is tight: arrival at the station → bathroom graffiti → accordion memory → altered logging practice form a coherent arc. Causality is psychological rather than event-driven, but each beat clearly follows from the last and tightens focus on the narrator’s self-indictment. Closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing: his role shifts from “worst thing that happened” to flawed witness mapping a path toward self-forgiveness, with the river’s neutral “acknowledging receipt” as cost-aware cadence. Orientation is impeccable from the opening, with no structural slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → rule of silence → experimental exploration → ethical reframing of “unsaid” → final choice about the letters. Causality holds under the textural lens: her attempts to “read” via sound delays naturally escalate into the conceptual realization that conventional documentation would be vandalism. Closure lands clearly in the paired acts of erasing the first letter and radically compressing the second into “a single sentence,” with a tangible cost to her prior life and ambitions. A hair more clarity about what the Institute/Council concretely threaten would sharpen the felt stakes of that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story’s causal spine is clean: summoned to authenticate → confronted with omens (plants, coffee, violin’s memory) → forced to choose whether and how to sign. The single-scene structure holds under a Situational/Accumulative lens, with each image (violin, plants, coffee) tightening the same central decision. Closure is strong Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses the easy path by refusing to authenticate and instead redefines the document, and the violin’s crack and drop embody the cost of preserving uncertainty. Orientation is excellent from the opening; there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—ritual across multiple bodies, then the Isren reveal—builds cleanly to a charged final moment. Causality is legible: her unique skill with the chip leads from cosmetic work to something closer to psychopomp work, and then to the personal test. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the clear tone reconfigures the situation without telling us its consequence, and the cost (risk of losing Isren and a part of herself) is articulated. The only limitation is that the final tonal shift feels a shade more atmospheric than decisively reconfiguring, keeping it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: dreams → hairpin → climb → grotto → confrontation with the old woman → vision via the smoke column → planting the seed. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, but the closure is still tightly causal: touching the cycle reconfigures her understanding and options. Closure has a clear conceptual before/after with cost—she relinquishes the fantasy of contentment as earned payment and accepts rotation instead. Structure is linear and legible despite its lyricism, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous visit from arrival to departure, with the lighthouse conversation as the spine. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens: hiring → probing → chime-reading → reframed understanding. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, but the before/after (Mara slightly relieved of binary judgment; narrator carrying “sharp and unsure” morning) reads clearly and carries cost. Nothing essential is left hanging or introduced then dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene, one demonstration, and a clear progression from expectation of spectacle to a subtler, more dangerous lesson. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens—each move (the grotto, the basin, the stone, the ripples, the trance) leads naturally to Mora’s near-erasure and the final refusal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she now understands vanishing as a choice with cost, and Elian forecloses the dangerous path for tonight. Stakes are internal but legible, and there are no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival, preparation, practice (stone-skimming and reading birds), then conceptual turn and closure. Causality is subtle but present—each physical action (waiting, laying out stones, skimming, listening) deepens his understanding and narrows him toward stillness as the answer. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines navigation as rearranging the world around his still point, with the canyon’s echoes and his pulse newly integrated. Stakes remain inward and philosophical, but they are coherent and consistently advanced.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Orren’s routine is disrupted by the keystone, the tag seeds its impossible function, its pull leads him to the unmapped stair, which leads to the ledge and the decision to step. Orientation is excellent; we know very early who he is, where he is, and what the story-engine does. Closure is on the page: he commits to a new path (“He stepped into mist”) with clear before/after stakes. The piece is essentially one tightening strand with no dropped setups, though the danger/consequence of this act remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: fallen lantern → key tag → humming compass → ship → vow library → personal vow → new perception of sound. Closure is strong: he makes a decisive vow that reconfigures his life stance and gains a costly new vulnerability along with his gift. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal scaffold, lyric deepening), held consistently through to the ending image. If anything, the external risk of the underwater excursion is under-leveraged as explicit pressure, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, with cosmological context and the backwards prophecy feeding directly into a clear turning point. The decisive change—refusing to cast again and instead tuning the dials by choice—is legible and causally motivated by the received message. The cost (loss of role, assumption of unbuffered responsibility) is conceptually clear on the page. Stakes remain more metaphysical than situationally acute, which keeps this just shy of absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: he returns after finding recordings, sets up the ritual, then repeatedly summons and crystallizes fears, with each cycle deepening the premise. Causality is coherent even in a lyric mode—recordings + scattered light + atlas + echoes → monsters → salt shards—and the child-sacrifice flashback is well-anchored and clearly alters his present stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses ongoing, costly listening instead of harvest, reframing his role while accepting endless regret. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than event-driven, but it is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine under an accumulative/textural lens: bell washed ashore → Tamsin interprets its silence as imbalance → she brings it to the viaduct and uses her drip-sense to complete its function. Orientation is excellent and the legend of the viaduct is economically folded in to justify why this act matters cosmically. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she feels storms and tides realign and “lets it ring,” with the cost anchored in the possible break or renewal of her faith. The only thing holding this short of the very top tier is that the after-effects of this act remain more conceptual than dramatized, leaving the price felt but still somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: solitary patrol → discovery of label → realization the photos form a deliberate trail → arrival at Mara’s photo → choice to speak to the gathered neighbors. Causality holds under a textural lens—the resurfacing town and the breadcrumb photos steadily narrow his internal options until he must redefine his role. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he pivots from technical guardian to keeper of stories in front of witnesses. The only limit is that external stakes (council decisions, possible demolition) stay largely in forecast rather than being tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation of the apparatus, rising pressure as the starlings defy his models, then the pivotal intuitive adjustment and experiential aftermath. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each step of the ritual and each memory reframes his options without breaking scene momentum. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that the transformation is of perception—and the cost (relinquishing total control of mystery) is legible. The stakes remain focused and there are no dangling set-ups; the single quiet scene is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ascent-watch-report sequence with a clear inciting incident (the hitch in the static), progressive decoding, and a decisive reporting choice. Causality is tight—because she hears, decodes, and judges, she sends the report, which reconfigures the outcome below. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she remains in the role, but with the cost of unseen, high-stakes judgment crystallized. No orientation or lens issues interfere with the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: hearing → blades → rule that strikes erase memories → duel through key memories → climactic choice not to cut the guilt. The structure is a single continuous scene with embedded memory projections, and the rules of the memory-combat are clear and consistently applied. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Arin foregoes an easy internal “clean slate,” accepting guilt as necessary, which will shape the verdict. The only mild limitation is that the legal “custody” outcome is implied rather than sharply crystallized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain—mysterious envelope → decision to wait → decision to open → realization of coordinates → planting → altered perception/vision—reads clean, with one continuous scene and no orientation debt. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the escape room is redefined as a threshold to something older and stranger beneath the town, with the seed as architectural blueprint. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (driving away casual customers, surrendering the space to a deeper agency), but it is legible on the page. Escalation is quiet but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: preparation in the tunnel, activation of the “symphony,” upstairs reverberation, then a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is clean—Lysander’s actions directly provoke the house’s response and the parents’ first laughter since Mara’s death. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the household’s silence cracks and Lysander reframes his work as ongoing labor rather than a one-off exorcism. The scene remains focused on one dominant stake with no orientation issues or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: waking in the garden → confrontation with the guardian → pendant vision → posed dilemma → paradoxical decision. Causality is consistent within a lyric, slightly surreal frame, and the library’s “rearranging” logic is taught early then paid off conceptually at the end. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the narrator accepts the corridor’s risk by taking the pendant while postponing the literal step, with a felt cost in the uncertainty embraced. The only modest limitation is that the cost remains more conceptual than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrive at nexus → identify crozier → attempt a dangerous repurposing → succeed, with visible aftereffects. Orientation (who/where/when/what) is established quickly and never lost, and the ritual’s mechanics are legible without exposition bloat. Closure lands as both a Decisive Change (crozier’s destruction and the blessings’ redirection) and a Conceptual Repricing of authority, with cost implied in the destabilization of social obedience. The main limitation is that no external obstacle interrupts the plan, so the path from intent to outcome is smooth rather than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival, tuning in, revelation of the city’s wish, and negotiated reconfiguration, all in one continuous scene. Causality is firm under a lyric surface—the instruments enable perception, which reveals the city’s pressure, which forces the narrator’s ethical choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: endings as “entry codes” is tested and applied in concrete terms with the phased dismantling plan. The cost—no immediate release, only a slow, controlled death that protects others—reads clearly in the final softened “dial tone.”

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks cleanly from routine crossing to liminal fog to the appearance of the grotto and Eli’s decisive meddling with the radio. Causality under a Hybrid (causal/lyric) lens is coherent: his long-term study → recognition of the pattern → tuned note → entry into the all-ferries grotto → choice of “home.” Closure is on-page with a clear before/after, though what “home” concretely entails and what is lost by choosing it remains somewhat abstract. The pattern of the world’s rules is taught early enough that the grotto sequence feels like an intensification, not a rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a situational/accumulative lens: city → architect → descent → weaving → doorway-choice. Each phase naturally follows from the previous, with the architecture responding to her actions in a legible, rule-bound way. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis when she fastens the thread around the silhouette-doorway instead of crossing or abandoning it, clearly reconfiguring her options. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues; the scene is continuous and the cost of each option is spelled out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: brief exposition about the benthic city and past career leads causally to Mirror’s invitation, the internal debate, the meeting at the viewport, and the lesson in edge geometry. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural: each image and explanation layers until the final reweighting of what “navigation” means. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR in the final paragraphs, where the narrator’s role and the cosmos’s navigable structure are re-understood with an implied cost in letting go of old anchors. There are no orientation issues or causality breaks; the stakes are conceptual but clearly tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: twilight call → tracking via hearing aid → apartment discovery → unsent messages → decision to call Deniz. Structure is tight, one journey out and back in terms of purpose, with no orientation issues and a clear Global Drive under a causal lens. Closure lands on Eren’s protocol-breaking call and delivery of the message, a decisive change in tactics with conceptual cost. The only limitation is that external obstacles remain minimal, keeping the structural challenge relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: hatch → archive → codex → thread → lab → sphere → time-pressure choice. Causality holds throughout, and the arm rig plus gold fleck give a coherent breadcrumb trail to the sphere, with the tidal window providing a persistent situational frame. Closure lands as a form of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he chooses to leave now while the possibility and psychic cost of future “return” linger. The ending is conceptually satisfying but could hit harder if the decision moment involved a slightly clearer, dramatized trade-off rather than a near-immediate turn.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: present crisis in the observatory, interleaved backstory, then a concrete causal chain from spilled tea → ink patterns → algorithmic insight → system strain → Lian’s emergent voice → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative atmospheric pressure), and the closure—“we are writing who she will become”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, despite the lyric texture. The only minor limit is that the institutional shutdown stake remains off-stage, so external consequences are gestured at rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival at the canyon → entry into the tunnel → application of the diamond → revelation of the canyon’s history → recognition of the curse → decision to accept and transform it. Causality holds under the chosen lens, with each step deepening the relationship between storyteller, diamond, and canyon. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from archivist of a dying language to co-creator of a new one at personal cost. The structure is elegant and self-contained, though pressure remains mostly conceptual rather than narratively tightened by concrete deadlines or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: arrival → threshold (arrowhead) → core garden and phone → revelation about the missing → reframed understanding. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each new phenomenon (lamps, door, bowls, phone, voices) deepens the same central question. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing—the missing are not “taken” but metamorphosed into something the mountain needs—though the protagonist’s resulting tactical choice vis-à-vis the institute remains offstage. Everything needed for comprehension and before/after is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: locust shell → time-thinning → orchard’s pulse → musical alignment → roots breaking → city blackout → Lio’s ascent, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. Closure lands as a decisive change: the orchard is physically and politically uprooted, the city’s power structure is disrupted, and Lio crosses into a new world. Costs are legible—panic, darkness, infrastructure torn up—even if not dwelt on emotionally. Structure holds tightly as one continuous, escalating scene with no unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: world-establishing walk down the arcade → reveal of the bottle → tense exchange with Mara → final poised decision about uncorking it. Causality is solid under an accumulative/situational lens: the disputed-mail ritual enables the handoff, which leads directly to the ethical question about the storm and promises. Closure is a strong Charged Poise: Mara’s eyes on the cork, the risk to the town, and the implied before/after if she pulls it. The only thing keeping it from a higher band is that no option is actually foreclosed on the page; we leave at the brink, with cost legible but not yet bitten into.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: entering the train → discovering the hidden workshop → contacting the halo → singing to awaken the carousel → choosing to stay and work. Causality is clear and every step grows from the last, with the closure beat (his new stance toward silence and work) solidly on the page. The piece lands an RR-style closure where his understanding and options are reweighted with some cost in vulnerability. The stakes could be made slightly more pointed in concrete terms, beyond the generalized hunger for courage, to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: opening orientation, pattern of mapping hesitations, then the poet’s walk as a culminating instance that crystallizes her quest. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each star, each path walked, builds toward the final intersection. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the “place” of stories is redefined from geometric coordinates to a human stance of attention. Stakes remain modest and there’s no strong on-page constraint or loss attached to the realization, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival → learning the rules → daily sunrises → villagers’ requests → suspicion about the vanished librarian → charged final sunrise. Causality is coherent and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the archipelago and jars are fixed with “indelible, tender clarity,” reweighting the whole premise. The cost—her ongoing hollowness and the unresolved dream—is established but not made sharply legible in the final beat itself, slightly softening the sense of before/after stakes. Still, the global drive and closure effect are clear and satisfying for a lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a single, continuous encounter framed by a clear before/after: arriving with the vial vs. reconfiguring the relationship to fear at the end. Causality is coherent under an accumulative lens: rumor → meeting → offering vial → first star as “begin” → vial opening → internal reorientation. Closure is on-page and legible as a conceptual repricing of fear with cost in relinquishing a long-held defense. The piece is quiet but not static; each move narrows toward that inner hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: return to bay → recollection of bargain → discovery of the constellation-mushroom map → decision to reclaim memories despite new loss, with each step motivated and legible. Closure lands as an on-page reconfiguration: “for the first time my own story felt unswervingly mine,” with the price of blurred factual recall stated and dramatized. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings) holds cleanly through to the end. Stakes and costs are internal but precise enough that the before/after boundary is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal structure: Council decree → Rhea brings Jun to the library → tea-leaf reading formalizes reversible exile → the closing pact. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Rhea and Jun accept a costly compromise (mirror exile with the guarantee of painful memory), clearly reconfiguring the initial problem of permanent forgetting. Stakes and rules around reversible exile are legible without over-explanation. The story stops just before the literal entry into the mirrors, which works, though one more concrete gesture toward that threshold might have intensified the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → explanation → seed ritual → internal reconfiguration, all under a single coherent lens. Causality holds at every step, and the closure beat (realizing they’ve planted their first true hope) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible before/after. The cost—risking belief again after fleeing a deadened city—is present but could be sharpened with a more explicit sense of what the narrator stands to lose by opening up. Still, the scene feels structurally whole and publishable at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene framed by brief, anchored memories, with each knot release progressively deepening the situation. The causal chain (accepting the net → working through knots → voices → final name) is legible under an accumulative/textural lens, and the ending offers a clear reconfiguration: the captain named, spirits resting, Ilan’s future work subtly altered. Closure carries cost in Ilan’s willingness to bear the name and then release it, tied to his own grief. The only minor weakness is that the external risk level remains low, so the climax feels more like a deepening than a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: call → museum visit → two reels viewed → interpretive recommendation, with the second reel reweighting the first and deepening the chapel’s status as a wounded listener. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of silence, damaged frescoes, and the aging woman’s changed presence coheres into a conceptual repricing of what “reopening” should mean. Closure lands in the final sentence as a redefinition of the site’s purpose, though the tangible cost is more conceptual/ethical than dramatized in concrete stakes. Orientation is clear and the single transition (from first to second reel) is legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: dive → discovery → chamber → ethical decision, with clear causal links and no orientation debt. The cylinder and note refract everything that came before and reframe the mission as an experiment in memory and release, giving a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The global drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural, and it holds through to the ending. The only limit is that the final compromise is gestured at rather than shown, which slightly blurs the before/after in practical terms even as the conceptual closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: prior encoding → activation with the plate → the wall’s emergence → its request → Lio’s offer → citywide release. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, but the closure beat functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear before/after in what language can do for the city. Cost is present conceptually—Lio relinquishes privacy and perhaps safety in becoming a conduit—though it remains more implied than dramatized. Orientation and temporal framing are precise, and there are no dropped setups or incoherent links.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal progression is clean and legible: theft of the key → elevator ascent → lock puzzle → diary encounter → conceptual shift, all within one tight scene. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a thematic/accumulative payoff, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she descends with a new “script” for reading suffering. The main structural weakness is that no external obstacle (guards, malfunction, misstep) ever bites on the declared risk, so the tension stays hypothetical rather than concretely tested. Still, for the length, the single throughline is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene accumulative structure: initial drift, reflection, then the tremor/crosswind beat that recontextualizes the gondola’s motion as atmospheric memory. Causality is soft but coherent—her past decision to stay, the severed cable, and the repeated tugs of past flights all feed the present drift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her experiment conceptually succeeds, with cost implied in her continued isolation and acceptance. The main limitation is that the crucial choice (to remain aboard post-accident) happens off-page, so the on-page arc leans more on realization than on structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the present-time farewell scene is steadily deepened by tightly anchored backstory (the first commission, the coin, the safe) that all feed the final act of painting the book. The demolition countdown and horns provide a simple but effective spine, and the story stays oriented in place, time, and POV. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: limits refigured from failure to frame, both for art and for her memory, with the cost of the lost library and compressed skies clearly in view. The only reason this doesn’t quite reach the very highest band is that the external stakes (actual demolition) land more as atmospheric pressure than as something she engages in a final, consequential choice about.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean: a present-time airship survey frame, discovery of the hopscotch pattern, test against the mother’s coordinates, and a final decision to follow it, all under a Hybrid lens with strong accumulative texture. Causality is coherent—Lio’s pattern-tracking leads to a proposition, Orvan’s conditional acceptance leads to the climactic “dance” that opens the corridor of sky. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the ship has committed to a risky, nonstandard navigation method and the sky responds, reconfiguring their options. The main weakness is that the concrete cost of this decision is only gestured at (risk named but not bitten into), which keeps the closure from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival → test with prophecies → access to the hall → iterative unlocking → thawing closure. Causality is coherent under the lyric lens (prophecies tune the locksmith; tuned gears unlock lives; library responds), and the global drive never drifts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library begins to thaw because of the locksmith’s work, with an implied cost in effort and emotional entanglement. Stakes and cost are conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, but they are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: quakes → messages under the bell → organized preparation → nebula formation and intensified danger → last-minute adaptation and crossing → partial survival with cost. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with a situational backdrop (planetary decay and nebula legend) that consistently pressures tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community stands on a surviving span, transformed from strangers to family, with a clear before/after marked by saved orchards and the bell in shards. If anything, the transition from “legend” of the nebula to its concrete behavior is a touch brisk, but it doesn’t undercut coherence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: arrival at the lighthouse → subversive substitution → entry into the clock’s chambers → micro-adjustments → reconfigured ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/partial repricing: the world’s end is softened, not averted, and he accepts that constrained victory at real cost (“vastness of what would still be lost”). Orientation is crystal clear from early on and the clock/lighthouse rules stay internally consistent. The constraint that this is “time’s final ripple” is honored; his choices there visibly alter options without undercutting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: origin of the role → first guided traveler → compressive “years passed” montage → tightening with the blueprint-seeking man. Causality holds under a mainly causal/hybrid lens (the nut enables path assembly; guiding alters how frost and blueprint accrue). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: realization that the blueprint “wants to be remembered” and that this traveler may free the orchard, which clearly reweights everything prior. The cost and decision remain mostly conceptual rather than fully enacted, so the ending feels like the launch into a larger story rather than a fully closed short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—accident → long delay in grief → return to station → river study → new polymer → successful test → riverside resolution—is clean, and the accumulative structure of reflection framed by present stimuli is coherent. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she does not undo Leo’s death but re-prices her responsibility and future work in the final chrysalis/river image. Stakes and constraints (Leo’s death, the dangerous resin, the need to test it under stress) remain active through the end. The main structural softness is the “months later” jump to a passed test, told rather than partly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: quiet setup of the shop, then the first customer, then the moonlight/slate experiment, culminating in a conceptual reconfiguration of what “beginning” means. Causality is clear within the lyric mode: the woman’s arrival and questions trigger the use of the bottle, which in turn reveals absences and forces a choice about whether to sign into that knowledge. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing—the realization that stories begin “in the cut inside each omission,” then concretized when she signs and his own name appears under Beginnings. The cost is legible (a life lived with awareness of fractures), though it’s felt more intellectually than viscerally, which keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: waking → tidal pool omen → descent → tasting shards (soft vs. unbearable sorrow) → cooking → communal effect → solitary aftermath. Causality holds tightly under an accumulative/textural lens; each act (reading the pools, selecting and dosing shards) logically shapes the day’s emotional outcome. Closure lands with cost: Rafi is altered by what he’s taken in, the garrison is subtly reweighted, and the fortress returns to “uneasy sleep,” a clear before/after in how sorrow is borne. The only limitation is that the inciting “unspoken dream” feels more tonal than causally necessary to the later choice architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: from first murmurs in the wall to full communal song, each step causally and texturally deepens the premise. The closure—a city unified in and through the rehabilitated mechanisms—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with legible before/after. Time and space are anchored early (clock tower, grain elevator, day/night pattern), and the pinecone weight provides a strong causal throughline. The only reason this doesn’t break into the 9s is that cost and risk remain relatively soft and idealized; nothing meaningfully jeopardizes the project once it’s underway.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene progression: arrive with a goal, activate the device, get overwhelmed by unintended entanglement, then make a reorienting choice. Causality holds tightly (canyon EM whisper → cross-wiring → entangled dreams → decision to surrender and reorganize), and the drive feels primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lio shifts from observer to living archive, with cost signaled by the weight of carrying others’ abandoned dreams. A slight limitation is that the stakes and constraints remain almost entirely internal and metaphysical, so options never feel sharply narrowed in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: gravity inversion enables access → wall thinning → descent into grotto → approach and test of the codex → internalized “seeds of vigilance” and return. The structure is one continuous, legible progression with no orientation debt and a clear before/after in what he knows and carries. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: vigilance is now embedded in him rather than in the hidden stacks. The main limitation is that cost and risk remain more conceptual than dramatized in concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is very clean: present-moment grove work intercut with a single coherent backstory arc about the storm, the shattered sculpture, and the fracture-maps leading him here. Causality is solid—his prior analysis of the sculpture motivates the grove experiment, and the sequence from setup to strum to collective motion reads as an accumulative build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands: he moves from chasing a lost medium to discovering a new one (music as shared motion), and that before/after is legible. The cost is relatively soft (effort, isolation, and the world’s ongoing silence) but it’s on the page and conceptually coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: arrival → ritual attempt → covenant communication → reinterpretation → negotiated counteroffer → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/partial conceptual repricing: he understands the covenant’s true nature and his exile’s function, and chooses a limited, costly adjustment instead of erasure. Cost is legible in the acknowledgement that canceling the covenant would unravel peace and that he must accept a constrained, morally ambiguous victory. The drive lens (hybrid but largely accumulative/causal) stays stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure—sounds receding, silences named, then focusing on the diary—builds cleanly toward a conceptual and emotional pivot. Causality is solid: town quiets → he listens and names → Mira’s diary emerges as unresolved node → the “halo” around it triggers a new understanding → he opens it as fireworks begin. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing of both Mira’s choice and his pacifism, with cost legible in his long-delayed decision. The scene holds one coherent drive and lands decisively without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: approach to village → council scene → sanctioned ascent → planting, with clear causal links throughout. Closure lands as a charged poise: the decision to plant on the highest branch and Maru’s conditional permission reconfigure the village’s options with palpable risk. The cost—bringing “death to bloom where children sleep”—is explicit and lingers over the final inhalation. It’s more accumulative than twist-driven, but the stakes and before/after line are legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Lio ascends with the inverted gravity, follows the anomalous water, and discovers the arrow as the conceptual source of the world’s resilience. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each strange phenomenon (rising water, rapid growth, memory-droplets) layering toward the final conceptual repricing. Closure lands as a clear re-interpretation of the planet—resilience as engineered intention—with some implied cost in the idea of a world bound to a single defiant will. The lack of a sharper on-page consequence or altered option space for Lio himself keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine—reconstructing how wind and layout turned a safe separation into “singular convergence”—is clean, and each step in the survey deepens understanding. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never wavers, and the logs-vs-real-wind discrepancy provides a solid structural hinge. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: wind must be treated as an active participant, leading to concrete planned changes. The cost is primarily conceptual/ethical rather than situationally acute, but it’s legible and tied to the dead engineer and the silenced town.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: anticipation → arrival of sculpted hush → release of the note, all anchored in one continuous scene. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with the chisel strike as a clear hinge and the final release as closure. Causality is coherent even in this lyric mode—no teleports or rule breaks—and the order’s existence “only at the moment” of first strike stays conceptually stable. The cost at closure is more metaphysical than plot-concrete, but it is legible as a charged poise around maintaining space for wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single progression from approach → descent → uncasing → revaluation → tentative new practice, with backstory interleaved to charge each present choice. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is tight—each physical step deeper into the range parallels an interior deepening toward the final realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines “weaving between worlds” as an inward path with a clear cost (abandoning his former certainty and role). There are no orientation or lens slips, and the internal clock of the scene reads plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear progression from arrival → explanation → operation of the press → immersion in geometry → altered stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each step is a “therefore” from the last, and the final conceptual repricing (“triviality of my old, tidy grief”) lands with felt cost. Orientation is solid from the opening; the workshop, stars, and halo are quickly and coherently established. The only limit is that the global drive remains largely interior and contemplative, so the closure, though resonant, lacks a final concrete choice that would sharpen the before/after even more.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: walking the ridge → pendant activates → experiential slowing → conceptual realization about Ralen/time → concrete decision about future routes. Causality is soft but coherent under the textural lens; each beat arises from the prior physical or emotional state (aurora brightness → pendant vibration → interior reconfiguration). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a modest Decisive Change: he reframes his work and alters his future behavior with a felt cost (giving up pure efficiency/solitude). The design is quiet and internal, but there are no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: quarry → car → town circuit → dusk, with each movement motivated and accumulative under a textural lens. The closure is a conceptual repricing: the final statement about objects holding what people refuse to feel reweights the entire day’s events and the town’s hush. Cost is present but mostly conceptual—the narrator’s embrace of “truthful lies” over strict empiricism and the town’s impending confrontation with its own emotions. A slightly sharper on-page consequence or resistance beat would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: orchard → backstory → market → puzzle assembly → sacrifice → charged final breath, all tied to Nari’s throughline. Causality is solid: she buys the puzzle because of Haru, discovers its blizzard-window function, and must pay with the tapestry to complete it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her world is altered by the finished window and the implied answer from Haru, at the cost of ten years of work. The piece stays within one coherent lens and scale, with no orientation or rule-breaking issues.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: orchard/workshop setup → mines as response → discovery of the fused heap → reconfiguration and return. Causality is clear (hardening world → strange commissions → exploratory mapping → silk yanking to key site → construction of new ladder-like structure). Closure delivers a Decisive Change and mild Conceptual Repricing: Corren discovers a repeatable method to coax flexibility from calcified debris, reweighting the setting’s prior hopelessness. The main limitation is that cost and jeopardy remain mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: summons → discovery of shard → sensory flare and recognition of repetitions → contact with shard → corridor of selves → active decision to redirect → altered return. Closure is strong and on-page: he forecloses the prior looped pattern and accepts the loss of all other Lios, which conceptually re-prices his entire life history. The structure—one anchored scene with an interior visionary excursion—remains legible and coherent, with no orientation debt. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative imagery), held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece uses a tight, accumulative single-scene structure: arrival → discovery of stones → discovery of letters → internalized question of protection → act of writing and minor ritual with the sea glass. Causality is clean and legible; each discovery meaningfully deepens the central question of “who will protect us now” rather than feeling like a list. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from transient deliveryman to self-appointed part of an ongoing protective chain, with cost in the implied ongoing responsibility. Stakes are modest but coherent for the form and length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: habitual tending → anomalous hum → realization of the stored oath → invitation → acceptance. Causality is legible under a lyric lens (his mailed promise fermenting into the hum), and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of what the lighthouse and his work are for. Stakes remain largely conceptual (cultural/ontological rather than immediate personal jeopardy), but the before/after in his role and the light’s direction is clear. A slightly sharper articulation of the cost or risk of aiming the beam skyward would strengthen the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece is structurally tight as an accumulative/lyric single scene: it moves from set-up (tea house, new heart, motive) through encounters with three patrons to the wing’s revelation and conceptual reframing. Causality is soft but coherent: his motive leads him to engage, then to test the wing in light, producing the realization about mirrors vs magnets. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the premise with a legible before/after in his understanding and stance. The cost is conceptual more than dramatic, but it is present: his old framework of measurement and magnetism is relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: storm → corridor silence → discovered sextant → rooftop activation → memory-mapping → dawn ledger, with each step causally motivated under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is excellent, and the pattern (maintenance actions becoming metaphysical maintenance) is taught early and paid off at the end. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Milo’s work and the sextant’s function reframe sorrow as something that can bend toward forgiveness, with the final ledger image solidifying the “after.” The cost dimension at closure remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete foreclosed path for Milo beyond an implied deeper entanglement with this burden of witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival at the greenhouse, approach to the mica window, reflection/recall of the Silence Years, then the decisive act of singing memories back. Causality is strong—her past choice to take memories created the problem, her present choice to return them initiates the realm’s painful revival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the realm shifts from numb survival to risky aliveness, and her role as keeper is emptied. The drive lens reads consistently as accumulative/textural with a causal throughline and the cost of awakening clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: accident → discovery of secret library → ongoing stewardship → Mara’s intervention → reading the brother-book → recalibrated understanding and stance. The single scene (with integrated backstory) is cleanly framed, and the transition into the book-memory is legible and purposeful. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Elias’s self-concept and his brother’s last contact are reweighted on the page. No major setups are dropped, and the final promise image structurally completes the invitation motif.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: Elias’s arrival with the bread, the set-up of the tea house as a liminal space, the conversation that reframes his guilt, and the decisive act of tearing and eating the loaf together. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he has not been absolved, but his relationship to the bread, his silence, and his own complicity has shifted at real emotional cost. Causality is quiet but coherent: his noticing and inaction lead to guilt, which leads to preserving the bread, which finally leads to this witnessing and consumption. Stakes stay internal and modest, but the before/after is unmistakable and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: alarm → investigation → discovery of accelerated decay → realization about meaning requiring re-speaking → dilemma between stabilization and revision → chosen amendment. The piece maintains a single, coherent scene with no orientation debt and uses the readings and images as functional turns rather than static spectacle. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the vows now include Serin’s additions and the library’s future depends on ongoing reinterpretation, at the conceptual cost of permanent vigilance and altered tradition. The only limitation is that consequences remain implied rather than partially dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: arrive at market → bargain for the fob → test it on her core question → absorb the cost and choose to remain. Causality is tight and legible, with the magical rule explained just before its use and the “wrong betrayal” warning creating brief uncertainty before the device works. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has concretized the betrayal and adopts a new stance—staying to “collect” other broken trusts—with a clear before/after. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; a slightly more pressured middle beat could strengthen the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → ring activation → guided encounter → revelation → charged acceptance. Causality is consistent at the lyrical level (ring pull → meeting strangers → learning truth → implicit agreement), and the orientation (where/when/who) is solid by the third line. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s understanding of doubt, climate, and memory is reweighted with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that the global “stakes” (planetary seasons, archives) are mostly conceptual rather than tested on-page, which slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a descent, approach to the canvas, reveal of the hidden drawing, and the act of finishing it, all causally prepared by backstory that’s well-anchored in present stimuli. The broken lock, the manager’s earlier control, and Mara’s death all pay off in Elias’s current tactics and emotional stakes. Closure lands clearly with his completion of Mara’s eyes and his understanding about inescapable callings, which reconfigures the initial premise. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and the before/after is legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rereading → discovering the plate/map → reconstructing it → choosing the observatory → using the plate to open it. Structure is linear and coherent, and the ending lands as a clear Charged Poise moment: the city’s long-held silence is about to be breached at real but as-yet-unpaid cost. However, escalation remains modest and mostly investigative; no single turn drastically narrows options or forces an irreversible trade in the scene itself. Closure is satisfying but more preparatory than fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: general pattern of Lio’s work, then a specific visit that tests and refines the premise, closing on a reweighted final image. Causality is clear—girl arrives with shard → Lio recognizes the request and the time constraint → he installs it and the sculpture’s song conceptually resolves the stake. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: wonder is reframed as something transient yet preservable in form, not possession. The cost (his voice sliding into muteness) is on-page and tied neatly into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: geomagnetic instability and inner static → conceptual analogy to controlled burns → stepwise preparation (drying soil, rerouting systems) → immersion in fears → ignition → aftermath. Closure is a clear before/after: mind noise is reconfigured, some roses are lost, and his compass “points steadily along the rows he had saved,” a Decisive Change with cost. The drive lens reads as predominantly causal with lyric inflection and holds throughout. No major orientation or logic slips; every beat feels consequential to the next.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drive lens is primarily causal: the locket arrives → prompts the gathering → shared stories reconstruct the past → Mara uses the locket to open the sealed box → deed surfaces → developers retreat. Closure is a clear Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard’s legal status and the power of communal memory are reweighted, with a social cost implicit in how long this protection lay buried. The slightly magical-feeling moment when “cement crumbled” from listening is thematically apt but leans on fable logic, softening the sense of concrete resistance or failure before success. Still, the arc is clean, with no orientation issues and a well-contained window of time and space.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous descent, guided by the dice, toward the journals and the reprogramming of the lab’s purpose. Causality is coherent—dice patterns → path choice → journals → joint cipher work that alters the servers and building—and closure lands in a clear conceptual reconfiguration of the lab from tomb to hidden heart. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and that pattern is taught early and held. Stakes remain mostly ethical and conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in concrete jeopardy, which keeps escalation from feeling fully maximal for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: lantern failures → town’s memory losses → salt chamber anomalies → conscious decision to “exhume” memories via coffee-grounds divination. Causality is clear in concept even if the mechanics are numinous, and the final image of faces and missing days in the thickened air reads as a Conceptual Repricing of the world’s rules. Closure is on the page and costs are legible (the town’s shed days, the narrator confronting that these absences are real and proximate) though mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete consequence. Structure is cleanly single-POV, one primary scene extended through reflection without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clean: preparation at the brook → ritual activation → progressive silencing of the prophecy → a charged, quieter world at the end. Causal links are clear (his spell reaches taverns, barracks, children, etc.), and the closure—prophecy dissolved, with cost lodged in his bones—is on the page. The cost is more conceptual and bodily than socio-political, but it’s there, and the before/after (a world braced against a prophecy vs. one where its “tongue” is gone) is legible. Structure is coherent and needs no repair for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: first trespass → relationship ritualized into weekly meetings → meteor-shower ritual that finally lets the building speak. The global drive lens is textural rather than causal, but the movement toward the rooftop ceremony and the seal’s activation provides a clear tightening and closure. The final beat is a conceptual repricing: learning the language of buildings is redefined as inheriting their denials, with the seal changing hands. Causality holds and there’s no orientation debt; the only limitation is the relatively low immediate risk around the central event.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: garden visits → discovery of shell → vision of brother → caretaker’s explanation → Neris’s decision to confront rather than flee. The piece uses a mostly accumulative/situational lens, but the because/therefore links are still strong enough for the emotional turn to read as inevitable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: “Teach me to listen without running” redefines her relationship to both the garden and her own memory. Stakes and cost are legible at the end, with no orientation or rule-breaking issues.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term secret forgeries → specific high-stakes decree → choice to forge a revocation → discovery by Sevran → key moment → signing as himself. The piece maintains a single, continuous scene with no orientation confusion, and the drive lens (causal with lyric texture) holds through closure. Closure is a decisive change—he explicitly severs his identification with the king’s hand—and the cost (risk of exposure, revaluation of his life’s work) is legible. The only restraint is that external consequences remain off-page, keeping the climax more inward than the stakes initially suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival and singing, layered echo responses, then the canyon’s “answer” that redefines her understanding of echoes and memory. Causality is coherent—her choice to sing here, now, prompts the canyon’s progressive disclosure—and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost (relinquishing the belief in a judging canyon that “failed” her sister). Structure is tight for the length, with backstory anchored in present cues and no orientation issues. The only slight weakness is that the explanatory passage about echoes-as-debts veers toward summary rather than being fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: supplicants bring dreams → Marek’s method activates → backstory context sharpens → revelation about the woman’s family and possible redress. The piece stays in one scene with a well-integrated flashback and lands on a Charged Poise closure where options are reconfigured (expose or not) with legible cost. There are no orientation issues, and the global drive lens (causal with moral revelation) holds throughout. The only mild limitation is that the woman’s future decision is deferred, keeping the structural turn more conceptual than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival in shame, progressive demonstration (whistle, droplets, currents), and a final internal reconfiguration regarding hidden effort. Causality is soft but coherent—each small act by Ren naturally leads to the next realization, and the moon-path exercise concretely delivers the closure beat. The ending clearly registers as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s sense of labor shifts from “useless” to part of a larger, luminous pattern, with the cost being acceptance of unseen service. Orientation is excellent from the opening; stakes and lens remain consistent to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: assignment → discovery of letters → revelation of the experiment and diamond → excavation → moral decision. The drive lens is primarily causal, and closure lands as a decisive change when Theo chooses not to deliver the diamond, with the implied social and human cost clearly framed. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, though the moral aftermath is gestured at rather than given even a brief on-page echo.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single-POV, accumulative/textural build from atmospheric setup to a charged poise ending: the new voice appears, proposes a test, and the story closes on Ilen enacting it under storm pressure. Causality is coherent—grant → exile → radios → emergent voice → demand → compliance—and the closure unit is his decision to stand and not flinch, with a conceptual repricing of dawn/darkness and prophecy. Stakes and cost at the end are mostly implied; we feel the weight of a bargain but do not see a specific before/after consequence beyond “the dawn would remember this bargain.” For top-tier markets, a slightly clearer articulation of what Ilen believes he’s risking or foreclosing would strengthen the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a quiet but clear progression from waking → opening the box → the woman’s arrival → shared remembering → reorientation of his mission. Causality is intact and legible—his decision to wind the box brings forth the music that calls the woman, and their exchange leads to a reconfigured ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his jars from odd commerce to purposeful “bridges” and heads toward town “ready at last to translate.” Stakes remain intimate and thematic rather than sharply perilous, but they fit the accumulative, lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: wrong sound → investigation → crypt descent → realization the binding has drifted → adapted rite that calms the storm-artifact. Structure is linear, well-contained in one continuous scene, and orientation (who/where/when) is excellent very early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the island’s pressure eases, the artifact calms, and Elias and the lighthouse “exhale,” with the cost implied in the risk of improvising a dangerous ritual. The only shortfall is that the consequence of failure—and any lingering price—remains more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: arrival → three days of seemingly pointless tasks → viaduct revelation → post-revelation stance, all causally linked under an accumulative lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: the protagonist’s concept of revolutionary change and their mapping role are reweighted with a clear before/after. Time jumps (three days, then “in the days that followed”) are smooth and don’t blur orientation. The main limitation is that external stakes (the cities) remain entirely offstage, so the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a continuous descent into the tunnel, the introduction of the lantern, the apparition, and the resulting ethical pivot. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: investigating → lantern → entangled visions → self-indicting realization → new reporting stance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: the narrator redefines “data” and commits to a cost-bearing course of honesty. Stakes remain local (job, institutional complicity) but are coherently framed and resolved for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Jonah’s request → Elias’s failure to answer → the gift of the heart → Elias seeking Mara → her reading reconfiguring what his role at the parole board must be. The piece lands in a strong Charged Poise: he leaves with a new guiding principle for tomorrow’s hearing, and the cost—risking being more than a passive cog in Jonah’s fate—is legible. Structure is tight, single-scene with one well-integrated reflective reach back to the prison. Nothing crucial is resolved offstage; the decisive internal change is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → workshop → Algorithm’s revealed agenda → arrow-kaleidoscope interface → launch → bell awakening. The drive lens reads primarily Causal with a lyric overlay, and closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing when the sky’s blind spot is pierced and the bell realizes it exists. The main structural limitation is that the cost of success is only lightly implied (loss of Orin’s autonomy and an upgraded, possibly more demanding reality) rather than concretely dramatized. Still, the before/after of the world’s state and Orin’s alignment with the Algorithm is legible and satisfying within this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: disappearance → anomaly (713) → suppressed bug report → pattern-trace → spoofed audit → forbidden query → discovery of where deletions go. The piece works primarily on an accumulative/textural lens but still honors causality enough that the closure (conceptual repricing of “deleted”) feels earned. Cost and future consequence of the discovery are mostly implied instead of put under direct pressure, which keeps the structural arc just shy of fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Ira is sent with a mission, encounters the anomaly, is confronted with pressured futures, and chooses a third path by reframing the treaty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the accord is reconstituted so the orchard becomes a deciding voice rather than a possession, with the implied cost of institutional backlash. The structure is a single scene that tightens around the mirrors and crystal fragment, with no orientation issues. The main weakness is that the institutional response and concrete consequences of this new accord stay off-page, keeping cost more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: accident → euthanasia trip → enforced reflection → volunteering → Runa’s directive → boat experiment → reinterpreted “sound.” The week’s summary is efficient and always anchored in the present, so reflection never muddies orientation. Closure is strong: the protagonist’s options are reconfigured on the page when she realizes she has been listening not for death but for the ongoing choice not to end. The cost—relinquishing the clean certainty of planned euthanasia for a more ambiguous, effortful living—is legible though still subtly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: missed last bus → encounter → conversation that reframes her flight → Tomas’s renewed watch, all tightly situated in one continuous scene. Causality is sound (her lateness and the burned letter both trigger his intervention), and the stakes cohere around the suspended decision about her marriage. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: they part still in limbo, but her internal calculus and his sense of purpose are clearly shifted. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through an explicit decision, which slightly softens impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and coherent: prophet arrives → denials power the kinetic parapet → the merchant’s question spikes danger → the line walker intervenes → a new mode of truth-telling stabilizes the city. Causality is clear (each denial feeding the parapet, the line walker’s near-fall prompting his counsel) and the drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture). Closure lands firmly with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the parapet sleeps, the “path of echoes” becomes a wall, and the city’s relationship to truth has shifted. The main limitation is that some stakes (city destruction) remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete, on-page jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: the arrival, initial meeting with Myra, first visitor, and then accumulation of offerings lead to a clear reconfiguration at the end. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with the photographs and stories building toward the insight that this is a “communal puzzle;” causality is coherent at every step. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his understanding of the job and what’s at stake has changed, with the implied cost of emotional exposure and impending bulldozing. The only constraint is that the demolition deadline stays abstract, so temporal pressure never tightens on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → world rule → looming erasure → research via crystal → realization → decision about how to testify. Causality is solid under a textural lens: the crystal’s fractured voices teach him the form his testimony must take, leading to a clear Charged Poise closure. The decree, note, and council all stay offstage, making the immediate consequence of his choice somewhat abstract, but the before/after in his stance is legible and costs are implied. Orientation is excellent from the first few lines; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: chapel and prophet → tapes and obsession → driftwood architecture → joint search with Mara → discovery of the sound → reconfigured understanding at the end. Causality is soft but coherent: the prophet’s project leads directly to the driftwood markers, which lead to meeting Mara and the central listening scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: realizing they are hearing “our lives laboring to keep up with the days” and then failing to fully convey it to the prophet, with the final line reweighting impermanence. The only mild limitation is that external stakes stay understated, so the sense of narrowed options is more thematic than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene that escalates from tremor onset to aftershock resolution, with every move causally linked to the quake and the stellar death signal. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they’ve captured the event at real risk, and the safety systems closing “like eyelids” seals a before/after. Stakes and constraints are clear, but the cost remains largely in the realm of risk and institutional survival rather than a concrete on-page loss, slightly softening impact. The accumulative/causal blend holds consistently under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that accumulates pressure from “after the blood work comes back, we decide” to the charged final silence. Causality is subtle but firm (results → mutual acknowledgment → symbolic gift → shared song → full silence), under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they accept what the results mean without reading them, and the song plus shard reconfigure goodbye into something “enough,” with cost legible in their restraint. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: past anomaly → obsession → rule-breaking ascent → ritual → conceptual discovery and internal reconfiguration. The flashback to the spoons is efficiently anchored and clearly feeds the present-time choice and tactics (using salvaged spoons). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she now knows what noon and shadows mean, with a new, risky stance toward knowledge. Stakes remain slightly abstract (no immediate external consequence for her transgression), which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: suspicious corpse → secret garden → tooth/folio knowledge → portal → bone-setting rescue → crumbling substitute body and reweighted doubt. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong thematic overlay, and the story executes a clear decisive change (she crosses over and brings the boy back) plus a resonant reconfiguration of what doubt means to her. Every major setup (the forged body, Tomas’s compassion, the tooth’s lore, the garden as sky) pays off at or before the ending image. If anything, the practical risks of crossing and failing are implied more than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure—present-tense grotto work, a substantial but clearly cued childhood flashback, then return to the grotto and the refugees—reads as a clean accumulative lyric arc. Causality is soft but coherent: polishing → memory of raids and vow → present fulfillment of that vow with the children. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: we see a before/after between her own childhood terror and the refuge she now creates, with the cost of her grandmother’s loss and her ongoing burden palpable. Orientation (who/where/why) is established early, and the ending’s cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: viral confession → return to the originating site → encounter with Eli → invitation to act → she accepts and remains. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the moss garden and pendant motifs build to a quiet but clear Resonant Reconfiguration—she moves from avoidance to a charged, chosen stasis in this space. Causality is coherent (Eli’s leaks + her confession → decommission → garden → this meeting), and the final image lands with articulated cost (public exposure, the painful train ride, the risk of being here). The only thing holding this just below 9 is that the inciting “crime” and its mechanisms stay abstract, slightly softening the felt narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: night walk → encounter with narrator → seashell visions → reconfigured understanding of endings. Causality is coherent under the lyric lens (following the vanishing ink leads inexorably to the river and narrator, which leads to visions and realization), and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: endings redefined as shorelines where currents meet, with clear cost in surrendering ambiguity as a shield. The scope is exactly right for this single confrontation; nothing crucial feels elided or tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—waiting, listening, singing, communal joining, then ritual act with the bowl—builds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration where the village’s “silence” is lifted. Causality is legible (songs → collected sounds → offering to tree → restoration) and the single-scene window is coherent. The closure has on-page change (fruit, wells, laughter) and conceptual reweighting around “alignment,” though the risk of reviving “cruelties” never materially complicates tactics, softening the sense of cost. Drive lens reads consistently as accumulative/textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walk → collect remnants → lay patterns → apply starlight → receive the map → archive it, culminating in the realization that “the map was enough.” Causality under a textural lens holds: each ritual step leads naturally to the next and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a decisive plot turn. The global drive—map-making as a response to planetary death—stays coherent, with no orientation issues. However, there’s only one gentle tightening (when heartbeat and starlight align), so the sense of structural inevitability is strong but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual-like scene where each move (descending, arranging mirrors, testing with words, then questions) builds toward restoring and reinterpreting the timer. The drive lens is accumulative/textural—sound, light, and reflection density increase until the charged stillness at the end—and the closure is a conceptual repricing where the device’s function and the cost (his own missed moments poured in) are reweighted. Causality is coherent and local (his techniques provoke the timer’s twitching and eventual revival) and the commissioner’s off-page request frames the global stake without derailing the scene. Stakes are quiet but legible, and the ending lands as a meaningful after/before shift.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: descent → gathering burdens → working them → confrontation with her own burden, resolving in an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Causality within this lyric frame holds—her annual ritual leads naturally to the climax where the heaviest, newly legible weight is her own. Closure lands clearly when she applies the “orientation” method to her fear and lets it join the pattern, with a felt cost (she carries no less weight) and a reconfigured relationship to that weight. There are no orientation or lens-clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rain and the packing circus establish “here and gone,” then the kettle and ash blank frame a present-tense choice deepened by memory. Reflection is always anchored in concrete present cues (rain, kettle, trucks) and keeps tilting her stance toward or away from carving. Closure lands decisively when she reaches for the knife and draws the first line, a clear before/after in how she relates to both time and grief. The cost—sacrificing the safety of permanent pause—is legible in how long and carefully the story builds her attachment to keeping the blank untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: daily trawl → rowing to the center → confrontation → offering up relics, with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he abandons the borrowed stories that once propped up his identity. However, the “negotiation” never quite resolves into a clear before/after in terms of what is gained or lost in that bargain, so the decisive shift is more conceptual than situational. This keeps the piece just shy of fully satisfying narrative completeness for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: arrival → discovery of sextant → recognition of systemic failure → decision to reroute flows → quiet dawn closure. Causality is coherent at every step, and the ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration (she has literally and conceptually re-plumbed the place’s “flows”). The constraint is that there’s only one gentle tightening; she encounters no serious setback or dilemma, so options never feel sharply narrowed. Closure lands, but with modest cost and relatively little narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: quiet routine → clock’s “cough” → rule-breaking intervention → revaluation at the desk. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural, but the physical disruption of the old clock serves as a clear hinge into a new stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, yet the before/after—time as something borne vs. gently reshaped—is legible and scaled appropriately. Stakes remain small and interior, which slightly limits the punch despite the elegant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → clandestine hiring → dive → discovery of blueprints → reinterpreting history → confrontation and refusal. Structure is one continuous, well-contained scene that escalates smoothly and resolves in a charged final stance (he will expose rather than hand over). Closure is a conceptual and ethical turn that clearly reconfigures the situation, with implied cost. The only minor softness is the convenience of immediately locating such consequential documents, but it doesn’t undercut the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → noticing rope → visionary decoding → encounter with the weaver → charged admonition and altered understanding. Causality is gently handled but coherent (the fulgurite enables a deeper reading, which in turn summons/earns the woman’s appearance). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of his mission, with the world subtly “before/after” in how he understands where stories live. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic but legible as new responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean: harbor departure → commission setup → garden meeting → walk-as-mapping → closing realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat thickens the central question of what absences mean, culminating in “nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with cost in Sera’s chosen solitude and the narrator’s altered practice. The piece avoids causality breaks or orientation issues while keeping a tight, focused arc.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from routine (palace, Continuum Engine) to inciting incident (the egg), revelation, and a clear stance shift that reconfigures his future. Causality is tight under a situational/causal hybrid lens—the discovery forces a choice between institutional duty and a new, risky allegiance to organic beauty. Closure lands as a charged poise: the vigil by redirected sunlight explicitly forecloses his prior role and opens a costly, uncertain path. No orientation or lens-clarity problems, and the cost (defying syndicate, potential contagion, abandoning assigned purpose) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: dune fire → boy at lagoon with jar → Maris’s risk calculus → intervention and symbolic “graft” with the coin, followed by the arrival of water crews. Backstory (father’s last blaze) is well-anchored in the present setting and clearly reframes Maris’s choices without stalling momentum. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines her relationship to her father’s legacy through the coin-and-jar gesture and the internal easing. Escalation is modestly scaled, and the external resolution is quick once crews arrive, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: anomalies → living fountain → realization about locks/keys → descent to the box → sacrifice that shatters it and restores the city. Breadcrumbs provide a clear investigative spine, and the forty-three days compress effectively into one accumulating line rather than feeling like summary. Closure is decisive and on the page, with a tangible before/after in both city and protagonist, and the cost (her certainty) is explicit. The causal lens holds throughout without gaps or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: present-tense tending of the garden, then backstory of the burning culture, then a return to the garden with heightened awareness of repeating patterns, all converging on a charged final poise. Causality is thematic rather than event-driven, but clean: past generational harm → exile and role as caretaker → ongoing doubt about whether this work truly breaks the pattern. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator crystallizes their exile as an ongoing, costly bet that “perhaps” some future sky will be less wounded, accepting the enduring loneliness as the price. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never slips, and there are no dangling setups or unresolved structural promises.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: initial accident with the butterfly carving → established ritual of autumn mentorship → this year’s extended migration and new experiment with the ribbon and secret lines → climactic retracing and realization. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new practice (hidden verses, ribbon marks) is set up, developed, and then radically reweighted in the final walk. Closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: grief is re-understood as a communal binding with a felt cost (recognizing “the distances between the living”). The only thing keeping it just shy of exceptional is the relative smoothness of the emotional path; no structural beat truly threatens derailment.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ascent and pause in the tower, with backstory interleaved in a way that always re-anchors to the present pendulum and builds toward the lengthened stillness. The “kneeling of time” is an effective structural device for the central turn, leading causally to the protagonist’s reframed understanding and new plan. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost, not a reset, as his role and sense of duty are reweighted without breaking the scene’s temporal logic. The only small weakness is that external stakes (trains, fishermen, children) are stated rather than tested on the page, reducing perceived structural pressure a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: chess clock → murmurs → sovereign case → silo → tapestry → self-reveal → redefined purpose. Causality is clear under a textural lens, and the final realization that graves “awaited not flowers but decisions” provides a conceptual repricing of his work. The single scene progression up and down the silo ladder offers a subtle but legible tightening. Stakes remain inward-facing and metaphysical, which fits the mode but slightly limits felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: new reports worsen the outlook, he iterates scenarios, discovers a climatic rhythm, and devises a plan that narrows options toward an ethical compromise. The structure—balcony to chamber to analytical grind to revelation to poised decision—is tight and linear, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a charged poise: lowering the nib will fix a future on the page with real stakes and an irreversibility rooted in the king’s decree. The cost is conceptual but clear: he forecloses other futures and accepts a burdensome, non-triumphal plan.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: we move from nightly routine to new instructions to a warning to the boy’s arrival, all under one coherent scene lens. Causality and accumulative texture mesh: the pirate songs give both the dust method and the warning, and Lina’s response (hiding pages, turning down volume) follows logically. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the experiment is confirmed working on the boy, and Lina reframes her task as needing “witnesses,” not solitude, at some implied risk. The cost and external threat remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the piece moves from anticipation to ritual action (ash-scattering) to a crystallized closing image where the premise is reweighted. Backstory (the fire, reporters, earlier charcoal lessons) is well-anchored in present stimuli and consistently tilts the current ceremony rather than pausing it. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: after the performance, safety is conceptually repriced for both Mara and the audience, with the final line marking an irreversible shift in stance. Slightly clearer articulation of Mara’s immediate, scene-level goal beyond “crystallize a feeling” could sharpen the sense of before/after even more.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous reflective scene whose pressure and meaning build toward a final conceptual repricing about truth as silt and the narrator as a “rationally rebellious rat.” Orientation is clean early (where, when, who, and the post-flood/plague status quo are all clear), and the throughline—his project of preservation against the Council’s narrative—is coherent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: he reaffirms his path with a reweighted final image rather than a new decision. The main structural limitation is the relative absence of discrete turns or tactical shifts; the beats flow smoothly but somewhat evenly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure—Thursdays over time, from first experiment to shifting chair distances to the final after-hours moment—reads clean and purposeful under a textural drive lens. Causality is subtly handled but solid: Maro’s method leads to the circle exercise, which leads to small harmonies, which makes Dari and Ilan’s final lingering plausible. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tentative shared chord is a clear before/after in their relationship and in Maro’s project, with the cost of history and risk still present. No orientation or lens-clarity issues impair the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric mode: alignment → discovery of seed → ingestion → pruning → renewed greenhouse, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ariel’s body and the greenhouse are both seeded, and the final promise about feeding stories reweights everything before it. The cost—risking her body and committing to a long, uncertain project in a ruined city—is present but somewhat conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. There is one solid tightening around the celestial alignment peak, but no major turn that sharply narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and causal: blackout → Marla’s refusal to leave → boy’s arrival with the matchbox → riddle-answer → revelation about Granddad and the tower’s condition → Marla’s spoken judgement that reactivates the city. The dominant drive lens is clearly causal with a thematic overlay, and the closure unit is a Decisive Change: her verbal decision literally flips the world from blackout to reawakening. Stakes and rules (city only wakes if she deems it worth waking) are introduced before the climax and paid off immediately in the tower flare and drone ascent, with no unkept setups. Cost is legible in her throat-tightening hesitation and her awareness that she cannot soften or delay the truth, which gives that final line tangible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is tightly controlled: observation → ritual → storm/shard incident → deliberate exposure to the altered corner → conceptual flip at the end. The shard lodging in the corner and his choice to leave it creates a clear hinge that deepens the situation without breaking the quiet mode. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Eli realizes he is the “creeping normality” the house has long noticed, which reweights every prior image. The cost—relinquishing safe detachment to accept mutual aliveness—is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is established within a few lines, and the causal chain is clean: secret spoken → environment awakens → visitor appears with ampoule → revelation of invited flood → joint decision to collapse the ceiling. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong thematic overlay, and the closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: the city is drained and the nature of “certainty” is reweighted. Cost is on-page—the physical sacrifice of the submerged city and the statue’s relinquished role as sole keeper of the secret. The structure stays within one continuous scene; backstory about the invited flood is tightly anchored to the present interrogation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: constant ascent, then a single major structural rupture (the crack and the crossing staircase), then a closing repricing of his quest. Causality under a textural lens is tight—each beat (dice, notebook, doorway memory, rupture) feeds the next realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he redefines where “texture” and value reside and consciously chooses continued ascent with newly weighted meaning. Cost is legible in the foreclosed alternate life, crystallized in the line about “a world of doors he would never open.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: set-up of her theory and tool, execution via painting, then external confirmations through three strangers’ memories. Cause and effect within the lyric frame are coherent—brush + moonlight + writing → daydreams—and the narrative never loses spatial or temporal orientation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the story ends with her theory “already partly proven,” reweighting the night’s quiet as an experiment that worked. The cost (a month of murals, her exhaustion) is present but lightly felt, so the closure carries more conceptual than emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean: arrival → guided descent → kitchen custom → lens test → revealed ghosts of craft → charged plea → decision to stay. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens: each concrete encounter deepens the stakes of memory and art until the lens’s vision forces a revaluation. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: “So I stayed…” redefines the narrator’s role with an implied long-term cost. No orientation issues; the pattern and drive are legible early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → tower entry → discovery and reverse-engineering of the yoyo → descent to the hunger stone → activation of the mechanism. Orientation is excellent from the first lines, and the story obeys its own rules (counter-clockwise mechanisms, low tide, stored hunger/energy). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: Aurek turns a monument to despair into a device that opens a “future still unwritten,” with the implicit cost of meddling in fate. The only limitation is that the cost remains more conceptual than concretely dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: cursed Polaroid → funhouse light → clasp → mirrors → pier scene → confession → curse break, with each step logically compelled. The structure—funhouse present, mirror transition, re-entered drowning, then return—reads cleanly and the rules of the supernatural space are consistent enough for the length. Closure is decisive and on-page: he confesses his true fear, takes the clasp, and the new Polaroid registers a changed state with cost. There are no unkept setups or arbitrary late rule-changes undercutting the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous crisis on the floating orchard, with brief backstory shards that are well-anchored in present stimuli and inform Aera’s choices. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens—turbulent forecasts → dangerous wave → percussive intervention → rebalancing of casks/orchard → clarified paths and calmer sky. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard shifts from precarious imbalance and snarled futures to a “restless euphony” with fear integrated as bass note, and that change is legible and earned. Stakes and situation are never confusing, and there are no causality breaks or orientation debts.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: present-tense balcony work → backstory and rising unease → council confrontation → solitary move to the gate → experimental call that triggers change. Causality is coherent under a hybrid lens, and the closure lands as Charged Poise: the turtles’ turn reconfigures options with implied cost. The lost expedition, cracking patterns, and rusted gate all feed consistently into this final choice. The ending’s cost is more conceptual than visceral, which slightly limits the impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single, well-oriented scene with a clear causal spine (Elias’s outrage → demanded meeting → negotiation → ultimatum). The dominant drive is situational—one pressured conversation whose outcome will reframe a cultural narrative—supported by crisp causal links, and the closure (his threat to publish a counter-history if rights are not returned) lands on the page. The cost is legible conceptually (destabilizing millions’ “guiding star” and risking his own position), though it’s not dramatized beyond Mara’s warning. Escalation is modest but coherent, rising from abstract complaint to concrete leverage without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-night structure is clean: drawbridge → skiff to pavilion → note-placing ritual → return, with backstory braided through present cues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she departs with the conviction that mapping absence can “burn,” reweighting all prior acts of hidden note-writing. Causality is modest but coherent (job enables access; rising tide and dwindling ink gently tighten the window). The lack of a sharper turn or complication mid-scene keeps it just shy of top-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: the blackout → altered atmosphere → inspection of gaps → hidden folio → testimonies, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the library’s role. Orientation is clean and early, with who/where/when all legible within the first few lines. Closure lands in the on-page discovery of the hillside testimonies and forged stamp, reconfiguring the premise of the “democratic ark” with social cost (the settlement’s peace is founded on erasure). The structure is simple but coherent; the only limitation is that the decisive change is intellectual and retrospective rather than forcing a new on-page decision in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from world-establishing ritual (shadow detachment, basilica) through setup of the illegal dream work to the singular high-stakes exception of her own memory. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: because it is the first evening after her shadow detaches, she must finally process the locket, which drives the gem-polishing and crane-folding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the personal grief pipeline becomes a sky of folded sorrow over the kingdoms, with clear emotional cost. Orientation is early and solid; no structural seams undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build from present observation → backstory → re-interpretation of the anomaly → present-tense decision. Causality is coherent under the textural lens: the anomaly over the village and the geode’s response push the narrator to reframe “unused potential” and then act. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a small but concrete tactical shift (“nudge the model toward repair instead of ruin”), with a clear before/after in stance and implied cost to complicity. Everything occurs within one continuous window (“while circuit breakers cool”), so temporal and spatial orientation remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: arrival → presentation of chip → projection → starlight alignment → interpretive breakthrough. Closure is solidly on the page as a resonant reconfiguration of Mira’s relationship to data, war, and belonging, and the before/after is legible. Stakes stay internal but coherent, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The one limitation is that external constraints are minimal, so the sense of jeopardy remains quiet rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the file → watch and note → return to terrace with tools → descent to the shore → decoding carvings → decision about future practice. Structure is simple but effective: two connected locations, one throughline of inquiry, and closure via a decisive new goal. Cost is legible conceptually (risking exposure of protected identities, overturning his own livelihood and self-story), even if not yet dramatized in concrete consequences. The piece leans lyric, but the drive lens remains essentially causal and coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous negotiation scene that tightens steadily into a single moral decision, with the brother’s appearance as a sharp, well-motivated turn. Causality is clear—past misjudgment → current vocation → present negotiation → surprise offer → agonized choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/decisive refusal with visible cost, reconfiguring the narrator’s relationship to his own history. There are no orientation issues or telegraphed twists; everything needed is planted in time.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight and legible: breakup text → kayak departure → deepening reflection → temptation to let “the water decide” → reversal back toward shore. Causality is clear, and the backstory about surveying and the grandfather’s death is well-anchored in present stimuli (compass, poles) and changes the stakes of his choice. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost: he abandons the seductive, quasi-suicidal surrender for the harder uncertainty of returning. Stakes are more internal than external, so the sense of real-world consequence is slightly muted, keeping it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean and legible: procedure → map explanation → stadium → tunnel → lake → conceptual reveal. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds, with each step deepening knowledge rather than introducing arbitrary twists. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the lake reframes the city’s “peace,” and the narrator’s role shifts to necessary bearer of cruelty/empathy. The only limitation is that the ending leans more on realization than a concrete, choice-driven turn, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that progresses from approach → preparation → metamorphosis → union, with each step causally linked (spices → thickened air → beasts dissolving → full transformation). Closure is decisive and on-page: the narrator irreversibly becomes a grove and joins with her spirit, with visible costs to self and beasts. The fortune-cookie prophecy and phoenix ash both pay off in the climax, supporting a strong sense of before/after. Escalation is more steadily intensifying than twist-driven, but for an accumulative/lyric design it lands with clear consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight: present-tense ritual → card spread → vision/bridge sequence → decision to descend, all cleanly linked under an accumulative/lyric lens with causal beats. The mystical bridge grows organically from the card reading and mementos, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change—he abandons the quest for “where time goes” in favor of actively “paying it back.” Causality never breaks, and the reflective elements are anchored in concrete triggers (cards, cloth, shard). The only minor constraint is that the visionary mechanics are accepted rather than tested, which keeps the escalation slightly more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure—looping immersions into archived grief leading toward a final aperture—reads coherent and purposeful under a textural drive lens. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when and mission are quickly established), and the causal chain from Tear → memories → ship adjustments → locked dimension is stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the final hopeful image triggers near-weightlessness, the Tear’s blazing, and the sense of a “door” finally yielding, with centuries of emotional labor as the evident cost. A minor limitation is that the progressive tightening of the pursuit of the “locked dimension” remains more conceptual than concretely staged as changing options.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: volcanic unrest and Niko’s established routes → uncanny detour to the beach → meeting Lila and the prophecy → evacuation bells and realization of camps’ danger → the lightning-bug detour plan → lava stopping short of the camps. The story maintains a single throughline under a causal lens, and the closure (averted disaster) lands firmly on the page with a clear before/after. One could argue that the success of his plan relies on a lightly convenient assumption that the entire population will chase the lights as hoped, but it remains within the piece’s fable-like logic. The shift from lyric setup to urgent tactical thinking is well handled without breaking structure or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → altered routines → Trann’s unsanctioned delivery → coded sundial → Iri’s decision to act on the gatework. Structure is tight in a single scene with one clear escalation point (the decoding of the message) leading to a decisive, rule-altering action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “the locks forgot which side was inside and which outside” conceptually changes the fort’s function and story. The cost—treasonous risk and the irrevocable opening move of her revolution—remains mostly implied rather than concretely dramatized, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric, accumulative frame: world loses friction → Arin, driven by his curse and promise, performs a mathematically-structured ritual with star dust → friction partially returns and redefines the world’s rules. Closure is strong and on-page: the wave breaking and pain in his knees mark a decisive change, while his understanding of “regulating debts” functions as a conceptual repricing. Backstory is interwoven efficiently and always tilts the present action rather than stalling it. Stakes are largely conceptual but remain coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival → explanation of the phenomenon → preparation → observation, all in one continuous, well-oriented scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, tension coherently builds toward the one-hour window and the moment of looking. Closure lands clearly as a conceptual repricing when the poet finally sees the auroral “scars” and his inner state shifts. There are no dropped setups or causal breaks, and the time constraint from the timer and storm holds the frame taut without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense practice in the atrium → backstory of the tin and arm → realization that the space is tuned → arrival of clients and activation of the “overture.” Causality is soft but coherent: his waiting and lateness prompt reengagement with the tin, which triggers the central realization and primes the final charged moment. Closure lands as a Charged Poise rather than a decisive change: the overture “finally began,” reconfiguring what his work has been but with limited on-page cost. The piece feels like an exquisitely crafted first chapter rather than a fully self-sufficient arc, which slightly blunts structural satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: quiet present action (printing), interleaved backstory (prison library, banned anthology) and then a clear tightening when the patrol appears. Causality under the situational/accumulative lens holds: the world’s repression → their clandestine press → immediate risk when patrols arrive → choice to hide the tin and adopt a disguise. Closure lands as a charged poise: the floorboard “breathing” under the officer’s boot and the final act of “reopen[ing] the fracture toward light” reconfigure the risk/resistance dynamic with cost implied (they came close to discovery). The only minor weakness is that pressure simmers more than it compounds until the patrol scene, so the middle feels texturally steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain from rumors → attic film discovery → staircase → arbor → reunion is clear and cleanly motivated, with the clock’s tremor as an effective inciting permission. Structure is linear with one major portal transition and lands in a resonant reconfiguration: they choose a stance toward fate and unfinished moments. The cost is mostly conceptual (leaving refuge/abandoning non-choice) but still legible. The ending is a charged poise rather than a hard DC, yet it feels like a real before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/situational arc: job → anomalies → council mandate → one-night ridge vigil → revelatory dream that reframes the island’s origin. Causality is clean and orientation is solid from the opening; the dream functions as a conceptual repricing of everything the “records” mean. Closure comes as a charged poise/CR rather than a decisive act: Kael now knows the story begins before the island, and any choice will rewrite stakes for his people. The cost of either path is legible at the end, even if deferred, which suits the scale and form.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present ritual on the islet, woven with backstory about the severance, compels the move from box → compass → grove → second lace → ghost ships. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot reach Mira, but his stance toward apology and the world’s rules reweights, with emotional cost. Causality is intact under a textural lens—the compass locking to the grove and the light through the lace are motivated escalations, not arbitrary miracles. The only mild limit is the relatively gentle, low-stakes surface action, which may feel modest for top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, prioritizing a shift in perception over external plot mechanics. The closure—taping the leaks to "narrow the variables"—is a resonant Earned Stasis that physically manifests her commitment, though the external pressure leading to this moment is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a fragile coincidence—frost patterns mirroring ledger numbers—to drive the central realization, followed by a genre-breaking "magic map" moment where starlight develops ghost arrows. This leap from grounded mystery to magical realism lacks setup and solves the plot's central problem too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and closes with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose. However, the "note to self" knotted to the lifejacket is a heavy causal shortcut (backstory convenience) that bypasses the need for active deduction in the present moment. The closure lands well, but the setup relies on this convenient prop placement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is seamless, moving from the inciting arrival of the package to the underwater descent with dream-logic inevitability. The closure acts as a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR): the undertaker’s role is recontextualized from disposal to preservation, offering a resonant, permanent change in status and understanding with the felt cost of leaving the surface world.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scene structure is flawless, moving efficiently from a mystery hook to a confrontation and finally a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with undeniable weight, recontextualizing the donations from "smuggling" to "covenant" without explaining away the tension of the sanctions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, gathering sensory and spiritual pressure before releasing it in a situational climax. The causality of the camera obscura revealing the "pilgrim of sparks" leads naturally to the breathing realization. Closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, though the transition from the vision to the interaction with the boy feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure effectively builds to a resonant closure, though the pivot from observation to action ("Tonight I decide") relies on sudden internal fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight, utilizing the "spill-and-read" tactic effectively to shift power. The climax relies slightly on summarized influence ("guiding his hands") rather than a concrete dramatized signal for the final input, but the closure—a Charged Poise where she secures the future while remaining bound—lands with significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the established goal to the prototype test and final adjustment. The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the goal from warning to repair. The logic of the "absences" and the device holds together well within the fantasy premise, delivering a satisfying structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is elegant, moving seamlessly from the inciting coded message to the climactic release of the jar. Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the physical "moonbeams" are revealed as the metaphysical weight of stolen gazes, recontextualizing the narrator's entire history with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates as a vignette or tableau rather than a narrative with causal drive; the "inciting incident" is merely an arrival, and the "climax" is a demonstration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift in perspective), but because the narrator's initial state and stakes were undefined, the cost of this shift feels abstract and low.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a surreal bureaucratic erasure to a grounded moment of connection and resolution. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist reframes their fear as a weapon, with the legible cost of "trust hurts" acknowledging the pain of the new path.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear situational lens, escalating coherently as the light fails. Closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing (the map redefines the darkness), though the logic of mapping "silence" is more poetic than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The loop structure is handled with economy, using the repetition to build pressure rather than stall momentum, and the breakdown of the cycle provides a satisfying structural turning point. Closure is decisive—the loop breaks via a specific agentive act—and the resultant state change (twilight thickening to evening) acts as a resonant reconfiguration of the narrative reality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is sturdy, moving efficiently from the inciting package to the investigation and final confrontation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of their relationship—lands with clear emotional logic. The connection between the lens, the doodles, and the "UV confessions" is a convenient plot device but functions well enough to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative drive lens holds firmly, building texture through the ritual of polishing and gardening toward a resonant closure. The ending acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, crystallizing Elias's merger with the maze. Orientation is immediate and the speculative logic is taught efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is linear and atmospheric but lacks mechanical friction; the "fix" (nudging a lever) feels frictionless and lacks a concrete on-page cost. The resolution relies on a Conceptual Repricing of his family's distance, which works thematically but leaves the plot momentum feeling slight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a flawless Accumulative arc, transitioning from atmospheric observation to active decoding and finally to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ruin into a performance space. The closure is distinct and earned, reweighting the initial trespass into an act of artistic rebellion with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the aftermath of a crisis (fever) to a new, heavier stability (knowledge). The shift from viewing the damage as "collateral" to "target" serves as a distinct, escalating turn that reconfigures the stakes. Closure lands with the weight of the confirmed hypothesis, satisfying the "Resonant Reconfiguration" requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational/Accumulative drive, where the physical journey into the tunnel effectively mirrors the deepening engagement with the truth. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator's acceptance of the "phantom footfalls" validates Evan's reality and satisfies the central motivation with legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is distinct and controlled, moving cleanly from stasis to intrusion to a decisive reconfiguration. The closure is excellent: the protagonist's choice to step into the current creates a legible "after" state where his relationship to knowledge is fundamentally altered, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration standard with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from preparation to the eclipse event with a legible situational build. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration linking the eclipse visual to the daughter's hair—lands well, though the thematic labeling softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure works for this vignette, moving from the diary to the tapestry to a synthesis. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the absence of obstacles makes the narrative arc feel flat. The transition to the ending realization is intellectual rather than earned through narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the establishment of the routine to the disruption (prophecies) and resolution (rerouting the signal). The logic of the spycraft—using lighthouse beams to direct smugglers—holds up well within the story's heightened reality. Closure is a decisive on-page action with clear, implied consequences for the island's future.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from atmospheric setup to a defined ritual closure. The resolution, however, leans heavily on a "logic trap" trope where the demon is argued into submission ("cornered by its own contradictions"), which reads as slightly convenient. The climax compresses the struggle into summarized rhetoric rather than a dramatized beat-by-beat exchange of power.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, layering memory and observation to build pressure before the dawn. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Eli accepts his role with a "felt" conceptual cost, recontextualizing his isolation as purposeful conduction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a legible closure unit (Decisive Change/Renunciation). The transition into the "seam" works within the story's logic, though the middle section compresses the struggle of retracing lives into summary rather than dramatized resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure that functions effectively as a fable or parable. The transition from the mechanical setup to the emotional release is smooth, though the mechanism itself operates on a "magic button" logic that resolves the conflict somewhat conveniently. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the students' emotional state—lands with genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a powerful Conceptual Repricing ("alone but aligned"), fundamentally altering the protagonist's relationship to the setting and their duty. The logic of the pigeon network skirting the "straight lines" of algorithms provides a tight, causally satisfying backbone to the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Elias's stance from avoidance to acceptance with a visible release of grief. The plot relies heavily on the high-context coincidence of Mara bringing Aron's specific recipe to Aron's husband, which strains credibility slightly, but the emotional logic holds the drive lens together.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational trajectory, but the progression relies entirely on a static conversation rather than dramatized action or pressure. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the narrator's life options—lands logically but feels unearned because the inciting force (the energy beings) provides atmospheric background rather than immediate causal heat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative traces a clean causal arc from the harbor’s stasis to the greenhouse’s revelation, driven by the invitation. Closure lands as a precise Conceptual Repricing: Elio abandons the need for resolution, a shift dramatized by the mechanical "almosts" of the pumps and the physical emptying of his earnings.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal arc is flawless: problem (glitching empathy), pursuit of solution (dealer), negotiation (cost of certainty), and decisive acceptance. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist’s relationship to "truth" is fundamentally altered with acknowledged cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a complete scene, but the trajectory is frictionless; Elias faces no external resistance from Marin nor significant internal doubt during the encounter. While the closure (the reading scheme) is concrete, the lack of obstacles or complications earlier in the scene makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear path with legible causality, moving from search to discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elian's artistic intent. While the structure is sound and the closure lands effectively, the progression feels somewhat low-stakes, as the search encounters no significant obstacles before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Flawless causality within a situational frame; the journey builds coherently to the "time knot" climax. The closure—a refusal that redefines the commission—lands with distinct conceptual weight ("drawings, not chains").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    A flawless causal arc under the 600-word constraint; the inciting desire meets clear resistance from the magic system, forcing a decisive change in tactics. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cost (abandoning the retrieval) is paid to gain a sustainable future.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path driven by the coincidence of finding the exact tape needed for the specific librarian at the right moment. While the structure is coherent, the resolution relies on this serendipity rather than causal pressure or active problem-solving that incurs a cost. The inciting incident (outage) enables the solution rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from rigid control to surrender under the "Accumulative" lens. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, though the mechanism (touching the leaf triggering a vision) feels slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal/Situational Hybrid line: the environmental shift (tide) yields a resource (brooch), which social pressure (Eron) converts into a tool for survival. Closure is achieved via a Decisive Change (leaving the island) that also functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the relationship between the two worlds ("exchange of hungers"). The guard’s acceptance is slightly convenient, but the setup regarding collectors mitigates this, keeping the resolution earned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Situational drive lens where the cave's pressure forces a change in Lyra's stance. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Lyra accepts her new role), with the cost being her professional pride and certainty. The causality is driven by the "unseen forces" rather than just conversation, which strengthens the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is elegant and structurally sound, moving from private collection to public connection. The causal chain—finding the valve, creating the space, the crowd’s arrival, the note—is tight. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned and carries the emotional cost of the community's shared trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is linear and clear, moving efficiently from the inciting discovery to the resolution. The closure (accepting the role of mapper) is definite, though the climax relies heavily on expository dialogue to explain the metaphysics rather than dramatized action. The "dream logic" transition works well for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving smoothly from the inciting incident with the tile to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The specific nature of the ending—transcribing until dawn to bridge the living and dead—provides satisfying conceptual closure and justifies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (redrawing boundaries) functions as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. The structure relies heavily on the artifact explaining the plot’s thesis ("Here is what happens after goodbye"), which softens the causal drive and feels slightly didactic compared to a dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change where the protagonist actively alters the terms of the deal, incurring the moral cost of complicity. The discovery of the ledger is earned through the specific application of the "active waiting" method, linking plot mechanics tightly to character skill.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, building density through the ritual of the "lamp histories" before a decisive pattern break when the lamp flickers out. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: Aurelio creates an orderly spine for the silence, transforming his relationship to the void from endurance to curation. The causal link between the lamp's hum and the specific narratives is a strong, magical-realist engine that holds the scene together.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story violates the 600–800 word default for a single continuous scene, operating instead as a broad summary of a lifestyle ("From that day," "At night," "Slowly"). This reliance on montage prevents urgent causal linkage; the climax ("One evening") is a brief shard atop too much backstory, diluting the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a strong Accumulative logic, where the resonance of shell and cello builds pressure until the conceptual closure lands. The "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the compass—from a magical object to a map of memory—is a precise, earned payoff that satisfies the setup without mechanical exposition. The causality of the magic feels consistent within the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative effectively bridges a timeline of months by anchoring the arc in two distinct interactions with Lilo, fitting the mosaic/shard allowance. The escalation from zoning maps to evacuation routes provides a strong causal spine. Closure is achieved through a "Charged Poise" ending that crystallizes the stakes (fight or flee) in a resonant final image, though the middle section leans heavily on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, driven by the relentless countdown of the heritage shutdown. The closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration; Ilya’s choice to send the amber signal (beauty) instead of red (death) fundamentally reframes the loss. The pacing perfectly matches the "dawning hush" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    The scene is structurally sound, following a clear repair-and-release arc with legible pacing. The closure—releasing the drone to the wild rather than its owner—is a decisive act, though the consequences (cost) of failing the commission are not felt on the page. The orientation and causal logic of the repair method are handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent, landing a Decisive Change (redrawing the map) that carries the specific weight of future "quiet trouble." The magical realism logic—condensation acting as a guide—is established via the "world here was quietly insisting" frame and pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("night after night") that diffuses immediate scene tension and distances the reader from the cost of the effort. The resolution hinges on the coincidental arrival of the woman, which feels like external convenience rather than a consequence of Ansel's specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality is strong, moving from the inciting signal to the launch and retrieval with clear logic. The alien text overlay ("WE ARE LEAVING...") functions as a slightly convenient expository shortcut to trigger the realization, but the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose—lands with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as a strong Charged Poise, reconfiguring the prison into a library of possibilities with a clear ticking clock ("before they find the bodies"). The narrative moves efficiently from arrival to the discovery of the method, successfully holding the Accumulative/Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The single-scene structure is effective, and the "bead" acts as a clear causal trigger for the resolution. Closure is distinct and lands with the high cost of the vow, though the brevity of the arc compresses the rising action significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (carving a new future) functions well as a Conceptual Repricing of the town's fate. Causality is driven by theme rather than scene pressure; the transition from copying the plate to altering it is a smooth slide rather than a pressured turn. The sleepwalking backstory serves as a convenient explanation for knowledge rather than a dramatized complication.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Over the next days," "Leila stayed through the season") rather than a cohesive scene, diluting causal tension and violating the short-story scope. The resolution is achieved through immediate consensus and coincidence (the trench collapse), lacking earned causal pressure or a felt price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative creates a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration," shifting seamlessly from bureaucratic routine to an act of personal reclamation. The closure—mailing the letter with the added code—is a decisive, irrevocable act that carries clear emotional cost and lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the prince's arrival serving as a clear inciting incident that tests Liora's vocation. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: the "void" on the map reconfigures the prince's strategy from conquest to erasure, carrying a distinct conceptual cost. The causality is uninterrupted, though the candle's lie-detection mechanic feels slightly convenient as a shortcut for tension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story delivers excellent on-page closure via a Conceptual Repricing: the brother's death is recontextualized from pride to fear, altering the meaning of the client's grief. The "rewind" mechanism is established early enough to feel earned, and the causal link between Lysa's command and the vision's shift is precise. The ending lands with a visible, felt cost (exhaustion, the weight of the new truth).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    The single-scene structure is tight, maintaining coherent pressure from the initial translation to the transfer of the coral. The closure—accepting the coral as a "deputized" memory—acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's burden effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative structure, building density through setting and memory before a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure is strong, recontextualizing his art not as personal expression but as collective resurrection. Causality is linear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line where the environment triggers a shift in methodology. Closure is effective: the decision to abandon the strict plan for improvisation is a legible Decisive Change with professional cost. The logic of the magic system (sound waking paint) is consistent and supports the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation is solid and the narrative flow is logical, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the plot relies heavily on explaining the system rather than dramatizing obstacles; the climax resolves a potential threat into an alliance too smoothly to generate deep causal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic (problem → ritual → resolution), but the climax relies on soft causality where the environment yields too easily to the protagonist's gesture. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a decisive pivot or paid cost, limiting the sense of narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: the physical repair of the chime naturally uncovers the metaphysical problem (the lost song), leading to a resonant closure. The transition from fixing the object to capturing the melody is seamless. The climax relies slightly on intuitive convenience ("images rose unbidden"), but the resolution lands with earned thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens where the protagonist enters with a deficit and creates a solution through action. Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise; the internal "lattice" irrevocably alters the character's capacity for evasion before the external meeting occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with a strong Conceptual Repricing (the city as a circle/loop), offering a legible cost (loss of permanent supremacy). The council's swift agreement is slightly compressed but earned by the physical demonstration of the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative establishes a clear causal loop of hiding versus facing the past, but the climax relies on a montage transition that bypasses the interaction where trust is actually built. While the closure (writing the song) is decisive and meaningful, the structural bridge to it feels rushed and "told" rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and logically rigorous within its magical realism framework; the causality of moving the chair to bridge distance leading to a literal collapse into the maze is brilliant. Closure is achieved through a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the necessary separation. The plot mechanics perfectly serve the central metaphor without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to a conceptual repricing of the problem ("architecture of attention"). The closure—using the burnt feather to redraw the system—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that unifies the past trauma with the present solution. The causal logic of the bioluminescence appearing in the dark holds up well.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic suited to the genre, leading to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing closure where loss is redefined as postponement. The causal link between the bird seeds and the deep fissure is tenuous ("ridiculous enough to be promising"), relying on coincidence rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal mechanics of the sleight-of-hand are perfectly planted ("placed the bishop... in her unseen right pocket") and harvested at the climax to create a moment of genuine wonder. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the woman's realization reweights the stakes with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is efficient and complete, moving from the inciting arrival to a ritualistic climax and a resonant closure. The structure supports the emotional weight of the transaction, though the "gaps" mechanic feels slightly convenient rather than fully pressured by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Accumulative" lens, gathering pressure through the inspection of the atrium and the visit to the pond. The closure—requesting one more day to witness the light—works as a moment of Charged Poise, crystallizing the narrator's stance against the council's efficiency. The causality is soft but legible; the "verdict" from the pond rings drives the character's acceptance of the situation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is functional, with a clear bridge between the past trauma and the present moment of connection. However, the backstory block consumes nearly half the narrative space, leaving the present-day scene with Maya somewhat static; the "sitting on a rock" frame relies heavily on the flashback to generate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a Causal lens: the protagonist's physical manipulations of the setting directly drive the gauge's reactions and the story's emotional turns. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final choice to rehang the positive pattern is not naive, but informed by the "grief" and "lucid" knowledge of the alternative "Unlifted" stagnations. The pacing is excellent, with the experiment acting as a clear structural spine. The orientation is immediate and the stakes are anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure works well, layering sensory data until a pivot point is reached with the film strip. The closure is a strong example of Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to redrew the maps and stay fundamentally alters the character's trajectory. Causality is clean, moving logically from survey to discovery to decision.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative to Causal trajectory, establishing the magic system before narrowing to a specific conflict. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the brother’s fate, though the setup phase (exposition on the painter’s methods) dominates the first half, delaying the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure successfully leverages the ritual format to build pressure, transforming a static ceremony into a high-stakes confrontation. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing: the signing is not a triumph but a &quot;survivable disappointment,&quot; with the cost of justice explicitly acknowledged on the page. The pacing remains tight, with the ritual steps (salt, ash, water) logically leading to the climax of the amnesty clause.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight and linear, effectively using the descent to narrow the scope from the grand disaster to the intimate mud. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the release of the egg is a decisive action with a clear symbolic cost that reweights the protagonist's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is legible and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "lullaby" breaks—lands with clear conceptual impact. The sequence moves logically from the king's order to the subversion of that order, though the mechanics of the magic (weaving light) are soft, relying on poetic logic rather than concrete constraints. The cost (treason) is acknowledged, satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scene transitions smoothly from the aftermath of the argument to the confrontation, with the backstory of the film festival tightly anchored to the present stakes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible emotional cost and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive, where the pressure of the migration forces a specific response, leading to a coherent and resonant closure. The arrival of the butterfly and Erin's acceptance of its transience constitutes a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the brevity of the success). The pacing mirrors the butterfly's struggle, effectively utilizing the "interrupted cadence" concept in the structure itself.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving from arrival to a transformative climax that permanently alters the protagonist’s path. However, the integration of the timeframe element (“years after forgiving myself”) creates a causal contradiction: the narration claims forgiveness happened years prior, yet the scene dramatizes the active release of “stiff apology” and guilt as if it is happening now. This timeline muddle slightly obscures the cause-and-effect of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structural payoff—a man named "Foresight Hindsight Only" finally stepping into the "present"—is executed with exceptional precision. The narrative arc moves cleanly from the stasis of the bunker to the inciting dream and the decisive closure. The cost of the choice (abandoning safety/the wafer seal) is legible and physically grounded in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from a clear objective (the experiment) to a resonant, non-binary resolution. The callback to the "smudged note" risks feeling convenient, but it successfully anchors the closure in the protagonist’s personal history rather than external coincidence. The logic of the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear inciting incident and a decisive reversal (the memory correction). Closure lands effectively with a Resonant Reconfiguration that recontextualizes the past and the protagonist's identity. The pacing supports the revelation well.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear ritualistic progression and excellent orientation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist merges with his objective—lands effectively with the established cost of losing his distinct human form.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story is front-loaded with expository backstory regarding the contract and the bishop, delaying the present-moment scene work. The climax relies on a convenient magical vision in the apple to resolve the uncertainty, which softens the causality; the protagonist is shown the answer rather than earning it through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The transition from the expository summary of the museum to the specific scene in the bathroom is slightly delayed but effective. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (stepping through the mirror) that pays off the nonlinear inheritance setup. The causality of the time loop is handled with clarity, avoiding confusion despite the abstract subject.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a clever causal mechanism (mapping catalog gaps) to solve the central puzzle. Closure is definitive and conceptually resonant, recontextualizing the goal rather than simply achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from a quest for capture to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the goal. The dream logic holds consistent pressure, and the transformation of the theater provides a decisive, visible moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative loop is legible and the closure is conceptually valid (restoring the timeline), but the resolution relies on a "bootstrap paradox" (the note) that solves the problem for the protagonist. Causality is smooth but frictionless; the protagonist simply follows instructions rather than earning the resolution through struggle or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear ritual execution that successfully lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the quiet established). The closure is distinct and earned through the established magic system, though the "cost" remains largely abstract (exertion/focus) rather than a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    While the arrival of the comet is a coincidence, the plot earns this turn by explicitly framing the protagonist's goal as an attempt to validate coincidence itself. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "shard of hush" breaks to reveal a past plea—lands with clear conceptual clarity and emotional cost, satisfying the situational drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, using the storm and shifting shadows to build pressure effectively. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the observer realizes he is also the observed—lands with satisfying resonance, recontextualizing the cost of his solitary labor.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clean, logical arc under an accumulative lens, transitioning smoothly from preparation to execution. The use of the fire spinner’s knot serves as a satisfying causal link, solving a resource problem while deepening the thematic resonance. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts the emotional reality of the siege.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly controlled under a Situational lens that resolves into a Causal decision. The closure—a Decisive Change to move inland—lands with the tangible cost of leaving the sea, mitigated by the seasonal return, satisfying the setup without feeling convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an Accumulative lens, building from the established world rules to a specific situational climax (the inversion). The closure creates a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) where the father conceptually reprices his life's work ("building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out"), satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing the gondola's containment to pressurize the scene effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is strong, though the ease with which passengers succumb to the silence makes the resolution feel slightly low-friction; the causality of the "blue line" device is excellently managed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the dispatch to the pivotal choice without wasted motion. Closure is distinct and resonant; the destruction of the throne is a Decisive Change that undeniably reconfigures the world's logic with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a distinct Inciting Incident and Climax (the scar ritual). Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the final image of burning a bridge "in a different direction" is poetically evocative while remaining causally ambiguous regarding her next physical step.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the pressure of the pumps to the decisive action of the hatch. The "Other Mara" providing the solution is a slight deus ex machina, but because the solution requires a risky physical choice aligned with the protagonist's specific history, the agency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scene follows a coherent Accumulative logic, building sensory and atmospheric pressure toward the revelation. The "audio-archaeology" mechanic is established well enough to support the closure, which lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's understanding of history.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, moving from a pseudo-mission to a conceptual confrontation and a clear decisive change. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the safety of the "script" is traded for the danger of the unpredicted, meeting the criteria for a resonant ending with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story relies on a summary bridge ("As weeks unfurled into months") that diffuses the immediate pressure of a single scene, pushing it toward a synopsis feel. While the Accumulative lens functions, the time compression lowers the visceral cost of the climax. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, validating the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, transitioning from observation to a ritualistic encounter. The shift from gritty dystopian streets to the "auric lagoon" relies on dream logic rather than strict causality, but the Conceptual Repricing at the end—refusing to look away—provides satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is excellent—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the future "unhooks." The large block of backstory (approx. 40%) halts present momentum, but it efficiently services the causality required for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured, moving from the established stasis of sorting to a specific inciting incident (the moonstone leaf). Closure is a strong Decisive Change where the protagonist abandons his role to alter the world. The causality holds under a thematic/causal hybrid lens, with the ending naturally arising from the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting mystery of the sound to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure is distinct and meaningful, though the progression relies somewhat heavily on the magical compass to dictate the protagonist's movements rather than purely organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is tight and purposeful, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (search disbanding) to the ritualistic climax. Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the definition of "lost" is transmuted into "wandering" with a tangible emotional cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure—shifting the gorge's song from grief to humor—is legible. However, the progression is linear and the resolution feels slightly too efficient; the "fix" works on the first try without a complication that forces a tactical shift, reducing the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the disorientation of waking to the clarity of the final choice. The progression feels inevitable under the Situational lens, with the forest guiding the survivor to the machine without wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from the inciting arrival to the acquisition of the lens and the final resonant realization. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the narrator recontextualizes their past career through the lens of the new tool. The structure supports the epiphany well, though the teacher-student dynamic is slightly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tightly wound; the ghost's pressure leads directly to the mechanical interaction, which triggers the structural breach. The closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change that reconfigures the story's reality with a high conceptual cost—the tearing of the "treaty" between floors.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is cohesive, delivering a clear Conceptual Repricing where the library's rules are rewritten. While the logic holds, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the &quot;negotiation&quot; dissolves the threat rather than confronting it with heavy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from discovery to ideological dispute to a Conceptual Repricing closure that lands with distinct cost (the official history remains false). The inversion of the mirror-shrouding ritual at the end—keeping futures in rather than time out—is a masterful use of closure mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is efficient and complete, utilizing a "Conceptual Repricing" closure where the covenant is renegotiated rather than broken. The logic of the resolution—using a truthful song to heal a lie-based fracture—lands cleanly under the fable-like logic of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure—reconfiguring the factory from a site of industry to one of containment—lands with effective conceptual weight (Charged Poise). The flashback summary regarding the compass's discovery drags the pacing slightly, but the transition to the vision is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a cohesive Accumulative trajectory, moving from disorientation to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview. The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing of the archway from a barrier to a center, though the external stakes remain relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and the causal link between the etched glass and the blooming flowers provides a satisfying conceptual closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the narrative progression is linear and low-friction, lacking a moment of orientation loss or failure that would deepen the final payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from observation to engagement, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maris accepts the "heavier" burden of history. The transition from the zeppelin to the ground is well-paced, creating a coherent dream-logic causality. Closure is earned, with the weight of the diary serving as a tangible cost of the parley.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bottle warms not because of force, but because the internal design is corrected. The logic follows a coherent fable-like causality where internal synthesis unlocks external progress. The pacing effectively bridges the backstory of the exodus with the present crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, logical progression from intake to ritual to revelation, maintaining a consistent drive lens. The flashback functions effectively to explain the magic system without stalling momentum, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the artifact's meaning shifts from confession to prophecy. The "slow clarity of nightmare" provides the necessary felt cost to anchor the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structural integrity is excellent, with a clear inciting incident and a Decisive Change at closure where the cost is paid on the page. The pacing moves efficiently from curiosity to the high-stakes choice without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, driven by the "zero hour" clause which forces a decisive confrontation with the protagonist's beliefs. Closure is achieved through a powerful "Earned Stasis" and "Conceptual Repricing" ("choice... between which story the valley would tell"), where Elias actively refuses the action, creating a resonant, high-cost ending that feels inevitable yet surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causality is driven by the coincidence of finding the lantern, but the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and meaningful. The shift from cleaning to witnessing provides a clear change in stance, though the inciting incident is purely fortuitous.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is exemplary, landing a Conceptual Repricing that recontextualizes the narrator's vigil without negating the cost of isolation. The visual of the stained glass light spilling across the ghost acts as a powerful, non-discursive climax that earns the final realization. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds firmly from the opening shadows to the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc that tightens into a Causal realization. The pressure of the "leaking" time creates a distinct direction, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure where the core premise is inverted. The causality of the garage sale interventions anchoring the townsfolk provides a solid structural bridge between the surreal setup and the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    The structure follows a linear fable logic (encounter → test → validation) but lacks a decisive turn where the protagonist risks something. Closure is achieved through external affirmation (the being’s speech) rather than an earned change with a visible price. The kite snapping provides a thematic parallel but does not causally drive the main plot.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative moves from a specific opening scene into a broad summary montage ("Wordless days followed"), which blunts the immediate causal pressure. While the closure is resonant, the climax relies partly on external forces (the storm unlocking the seams) rather than solely on the protagonist's agency, weakening the direct link between his struggle and the final breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a lucid accumulative structure where the walk physically and thematically deepens the stakes without relying on heavy plot mechanics. Closure lands effectively as "Charged Poise" (waiting in the center), satisfying the need for a resonant reconfiguration of the journey's purpose under the accumulation lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure works well, using the planting ritual to deepen the central metaphor. The closure—a conceptual repricing of the battlefield as a future garden—lands with resonance. The middle section contains a substantial backstory block (~25%) that, while relevant, momentarily pauses the present momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is exemplary, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the characters choose to weaponize memory for connection rather than destruction. The narrative drive is consistent, holding the Accumulative lens through to a profound final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens until the interruption forces a Situational stance. Closure lands as a sharp Conceptual Repricing: the definition of "north" shifts from a location to a direction/choice. The structural pivot from memory to present action is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is solid, moving from the climb to the ritual offering and epiphany. However, the lack of external resistance at the summit (the wind dies, the lid yields easily) lowers the causal pressure, relying heavily on the internal realization for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, layering specific interactions to build pressure before the gallery's closure forces a decision. The coincidence of the boy reciting the narrator's specific tragedy is a high-risk beat, but it successfully complicates the internal emotional stakes rather than resolving them cheaply. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the floor becomes the archive—is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight, coherent arc from the threshold test to the labyrinthine descent and final confrontation with the stone. Closure is definitive and resonant, utilizing a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the goal of forgetting is forcefully swapped for the pain of remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative establishes a clear problem and solution, but the climax relies heavily on summary ("So he worked, hours that could not pass sluicing through...") rather than dramatized tactical choices. The shift from physical tower to metaphorical tapestry is a strong conceptual turn, but the actual mechanics of "winnowing" the threads remain abstract, slightly softening the causal impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving from a clear want to a complex, earned resolution (Conceptual Repricing). The "before" (desire for straight lines) and "after" (prismatic knowledge) are distinct and causally linked by the scene's action. Closure lands with a resonant, specific cost that feels inevitable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting pressure (rising acid) and a climax that forces a decisive action (narrating). The resolution is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Corin accepts his role as witness rather than savior. The mechanism of the glass healing via "alchemical sigils" formed by speech is a slight causal leap—relying on fable logic rather than established mechanics—but it lands the closure firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, moving efficiently from the inciting shard to the closure image. However, the pivotal transition relies on a convenient "wrong turn" rather than protagonist agency, and the closure, while atmospherically resonant, lacks a sharp, legible cost paid on the page to earn the "temporary eternity."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and the Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with a tangible shift in the fleet's behavior. However, the progression is linear and low-friction, as the solution works immediately without complication, adaptation, or a "try-fail" cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, leveraging the single-scene constraint to build steadily toward a resonant closure. The lie serves as a Decisive Change that reconfigures the relationship between navigator and traveler, satisfying the closure requirement with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing (the terror object becomes a mirror), effectively reweighting the stakes. However, the climax relies on atmospheric coincidence (the storm clearing the eye) rather than a decisive causal trigger from the protagonist's specific mapping work, softening the agency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and tight, effectively transitioning from a bureaucratic inquiry to a metaphysical reconfiguration (RR) without wasted motion. Closure is resonant, with the narrator's acceptance of the boutonnière marking a legible, costly shift in stance that satisfies the "routine inquiry" setup with an unexpected depth.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis to a Decisive Change with clear on-page closure. While the inciting incident relies on dream logic rather than strict causality, the climax effectively forces a choice through the rising water constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and propulsive, cleanly linking the dream to the journey. However, the closure ("Isera remembered") functions as a Conceptual Repricing that feels more like a prologue's cliffhanger than a self-contained resolution; the consequences of this new knowledge are deferred rather than paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scene flows naturally from atmospheric reflection to an inciting arrival and a resonant closure. The transition from the backstory (the gin moment) to the present request is seamless, and the final decision serves as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's work.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The blank scroll acts as a sharp causal trigger, forcing the narrator from passive chronicling to active engagement ("walk straight into them"). The closure lands a powerful Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the tragic graves not as endings, but as necessary narrative drafts.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the engineer's arrival to the symbolic repair. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) works well, changing the meaning of the screw and time, though the "fix" arrives with relatively low resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive structure with excellent orientation and a distinct sense of closure ("Resonant Reconfiguration"). The ceremony provides a solid spine for the pacing, though the beat pattern (memory triggered -> rune drawn -> success) repeats with limited variation in complication.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving from an inciting assignment to a decisive closure where the protagonist sacrifices her career capital for peace. The pivot from performative exorcism to authentic confession acts as a Decisive Change with visible professional cost, satisfying the closure requirement completely.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with the unification of timelines. However, the inciting incident—finding the exact definition needed just as the universe hiccups—relies on convenience, weakening the causal chain of the solution even if the execution is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving smoothly from routine to a visionary climax and a concrete resolution. The closure (setting the key on the parapet) is a decisive act of Earned Stasis that effectively reconfigures the protagonist's stance with legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    A strong causal arc moves cleanly from the inciting observation to a decisive physical action (opening the dock). The closure lands with a Decisive Change that effectively reconfigures the protagonist's worldview ("change the model forever") and incurs the cost of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is emotionally coherent, moving from avoidance to engagement, but the central plot device creates a severe logic break. Finding a candle burning in a library archive ("an antique fire hazard") left by a man who has been hospitalized for hours (or days) is chronologically and physically impossible without a "magical" explanation that contradicts the story's grounded realism. This causal gap in the inciting incident undermines the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is seamless, moving from a vivid orientation to a specific inciting call and a resonant closure. The ending functions as a Conceptual Repricing, transforming the tunnel from a place of isolation into a "bridge where stories passed over," which reweights the entire narrative successfully. The causality is clear, governed by the established logic of Lena's ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from ritual preparation to manifestation and validation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "heaviness" of the paper confirms the regenerated covenant. The plotting is linear and effective, though the resolution relies on the apparition verbally confirming the success rather than a more dramatic structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (loneliness shifting from singular to shared) lands with emotional weight. However, the climax relies on a summary of the protagonist's reciprocal act—we are told he offers a profound truth about logistics and love, but the specific content of that utterance is elided, softening the scene's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and purposeful, utilizing the "pause" as an effective threshold for the journey. The progression from the forest's edge to the "stillpoint" is paced well under an Accumulative lens, with the ring acting as a clear causal driver. Closure is achieved through a distinct shift in goal that feels earned, though the link between the cosmic pause and the ring’s function relies on fable logic rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting anomaly to the resonant closure of "unbending" time. While the mechanism of the pen is convenient, the constraint—that it can only revise, not erase—adds necessary structural friction and creates a satisfying conceptual resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure works well, building from the initial quiet to the final musical resolution. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the meaning of silence is fundamentally altered. The logic follows a consistent lyrical causality, though the Advisor’s arrival is a convenient catalyst that lowers the difficulty of the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is strong and resonant, landing a clear change in stance (Conceptual Repricing). However, the "analytic intuition" trait functions as a narrative shortcut, bypassing the procedural struggle of finding the archive and decoding the script, which lowers the earned tension of the investigation phase.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from isolation to collective connection, but the closure relies on a dissolve into abstraction ("open sky") rather than a decisive causal cost. The realization of the drug's true purpose is delivered via monologue rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a magical solution (the key) that bypasses logical causality to resolve the central problem. The closure offers a tidy, symmetric victory without the required visible or felt cost, failing the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is decisive and earned; the phone call breaks the stasis with visible emotional cost. The causal link between the Guardian's water-weaving and the dentist's courage is handled through a satisfying poetic logic that bridges the two locations without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is clear and orientation is strong, but the resolution relies on a soft, fable-like convenience where the council members change their minds "without quite knowing why." This bypasses the need for a decisive, earned causal link, making the victory feel thematically resonant but mechanically too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure moves cleanly from meeting to journey to ritual, but the causality follows dream logic rather than character drive. The closure is a valid form of Charged Poise, but it relies on an explicit thematic statement to land rather than the weight of the accumulated action. The pacing is rapid for the scope, condensing the journey into a brief transition.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight and causal; the transition from performative narration (spoon) to subversive creation (whittling) builds momentum logically. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the redefining of the room’s atmosphere—and lands with the felt cost of leaving "contraband" behind. The drive lens (Situational) holds firmly from the opening image to the final exit.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative traces a clear situational arc from entry to address, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration of Lio's role. While the internal shift is legible, the lack of active obstacles or immediate consequences makes the closure's cost abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the silencing of the reed and the blooming of the plant mark a definitive change in the world state. The causal link between the painting process and the relief is established through the fable's logic, with the cost felt in the visceral effort of the art.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc from doubt to experimentation to confirmation. The arrival of the visitor forces a crystallization of Elya's stance, leading to a closure that reconfigures the "pilgrimage" concept with a legible cost (abandoning the score).

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a summary structure spanning weeks rather than a focused scene with immediate pressure, violating the short-form scope default without teaching a distinct mosaic pattern. More critically, the climax hinges on a coincidence—a meteor shower "that should not have existed"—to trigger the protagonist’s realization, rather than a turn driven by inevitable causality or a forced choice. This external deus ex machina undercuts the earned nature of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a solitary ritual to a shared reconfiguration of the future. The ending lands a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, creating a legible "before and after" regarding their stance on the collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving from the inciting interaction with the pagoda to a profound conceptual repricing of the story's central problem. The closure is excellent; the choice to stay is an act of agency that fundamentally reconfigures the protagonist's life and the world's safety. The drive lens (Accumulative turning Causal) holds perfectly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from the atmospheric inciting incident to the resolution. However, the middle section suffers from protagonist passivity; Lio is guided by the Overseer and the library’s automatic responses ("Answering meant the petals... folded") rather than driving the investigation through active deduction, which softens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, grounding the internal shift in the physical act of encasing the tail. The narrative momentum drags significantly in the middle due to a backstory summary that feels more like a synopsis than a textured memory, slowing the present-action pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative operates as a cohesive vignette with a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end, shifting the goal from silence to witnessing. The transition from the surgery's failure to the coffee-ring epiphany is distinct and legible. The pacing works for a contemplative piece, though it relies on a static "talking heads" dynamic where the heads are hallucinations.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and moves smoothly from arrival to realization, adhering to a consistent dream logic. Closure lands a solid Conceptual Repricing, reframing "failure" as "unfinished reels," though the progression feels slightly linear with low resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative-to-Causal path, utilizing the astrolabe as a functional pivot for the climax. Closure lands effectively with a Conceptual Repricing of "rest," though the transition from the whispers being "a hoard" to being "mine" feels slightly convenient in its timing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural path, building density through ritual until the closure reconfigures the narrator's role from observer to participant. The ending is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the act of singing into the "wave functions" reweights the silence. The pacing is deliberate and hypnotic, perfectly suiting the "frozen time" conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative operates on dream logic and coincidence (finding a gear that fits a random forest machine) rather than causal linkage. While the closure lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (insight achieved), the lack of friction or earned causality in the buildup limits the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect path from the argument to the ritual. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "explanation" of the magic in the middle ("He did not mean a rope on a dog") halts momentum and reduces the causal tension of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong, linking the discovery of the bolt to the final decision to speak. The "phantom apprenticeship" frame effectively justifies the surreal mechanics of the lobby scene. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the destruction of the fortress serving as a clear, high-cost consequence of the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Days, years, and dynasties arrived") which flattens the immediate dramatic tension of the scene. While the timeline compression is handled with lyrical skill, it distances the reader from the causal mechanics of the titan's struggle. Closure lands clearly with a conceptual change (the scholar's realization), but the buildup feels more like a synopsis of a campaign than a singular, dramatized event.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality moves cleanly from observation to hypothesis to test, grounded in a consistent "Hybrid/Mystical" logic where rhythm bridges man and nature. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of "drifting moored" successfully reweights the protagonist's relationship to the world with a felt cost of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to a clear Decisive Change (sending the message) that breaks the "lull." The drive lens functions as a hybrid, using atmospheric accumulation to trigger a causal decision. The closure lands effectively with implied cost (safety vs. action), though the bridge between observing the "static" sky and the decision to act feels like a convenient epiphany rather than a pressured inevitable step.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving logically from discovery to decoding to confrontation under a clear Causal lens. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that resolves the central tension of "implanted destiny" with visible social and conceptual cost (defying the Council).

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory details and memory until the gull trigger forces a recalibration. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration; the folding of the photo and the return to the tram signal a shift in stance. The reliance on the therapist's definitions as exposition slightly scaffolds the internal logic, but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from stasis to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts a divided self. However, the discovery of the "unmarked volume" functions as a convenient plot device that provides the exact instructions needed to resolve the conflict, weakening protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the revelation that time edits rather than slows recontextualizes the premise and forces a stance shift. The ink acting as a causal mechanism for this realization is brilliant, and the final beat lands with undeniable metaphysical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative drive is clean, following a clear causal chain from the alert to the final broadcast. Closure is decisive and resonant, moving beyond a binary choice (burn/keep) to a third, more active option. The backstory regarding "curious engineers" explaining the dormant networks is slightly convenient but efficiently handled.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Later, when raiders tried") rather than dramatized scenes to resolve the central conflict. This distancing effect robs the climax of immediacy and prevents the closure—peace achieved through labor—from feeling earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Driven by a clear Causal lens, the narrative progresses logically from navigation to ritual to confrontation and resolution. The closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the "broken rhythms" instead of forcing an answer, fulfilling the initial premise of a "shattered" world. Causality is tight, with the grandmother's technique providing a grounded mechanism for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative drive is strictly causal, moving from revelation to a "proof by contradiction" that logically forces the climax. Closure is a definitive Decisive Change (intervention) with unmistakable social and personal cost (dismantling her father's legacy). The pacing is tight, with no orientation debt or wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and decisive closure. The discovery of the failsafe note acts as a slightly convenient linear instruction, but the emotional causality of the sacrifice lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving efficiently from the sensory setup to the inciting discovery of the tile and the climatic breach of silence. Closure is excellent, delivering a Conceptual Repricing where Lark loses the safety of "harmless" art. The "unlearning" ritual provides effective structural pressure that forces the protagonist's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic logic holds together well, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing of the city's trauma. The "retrocognitive" loop provides a solid structure for the intervention. However, the progression is linear and somewhat inevitable; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or complications once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean "Charged Poise" closure, where the agreement to perform the ritual reconfigures the stakes from despair to active resistance. The tarot coin serves as a tangible pivot that justifies the shift in tactics. Orientation is established immediately, and the causal link between the theater's closing and the need for the maze's magic is robust.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on a low-cost metaphysical fix (redirecting the light) rather than a difficult trade-off. The ending creates a new stable state (the compass), but the lack of a "felt cost" limits the structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving logically from mapping the known (human traces) to engaging the unknown (spiral entity). Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming Iri’s function into a bridge between worlds, though the rapid pacing compresses the build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean causal line with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the release of the echo conceptually reweights the world. The mechanics of the button map are accepted under the story's fable logic, though the progression from entry to discovery feels linear and low-resistance. The orientation is solid, establishing the warehouse and its rules effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc creates a clean investigative chain (clue to map to object). A minor logic strain exists regarding the persistence of snow codes relative to the timeline of his processing as a "burned" spy, but the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of his mission—lands well.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for this vignette, building atmospheric pressure toward a resonant closure. The transition from waiting to the specific burden of the crossing is smooth. The closure lands a valid "Resonant Reconfiguration," shifting the emotional weight from grief to serenity, though the "rain gutter" beat momentarily stalls momentum to explain a habit.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, effectively using the lantern glass as a mechanism to deliver the epiphany and closure. The resolution (planting seeds) qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the logic operates on dream/fable rules rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure elegantly folds backstory into the present action without stalling momentum. Closure is excellent: the construction of the mobile is a decisive, earned change in stance that yields an immediate, resonant result with the neighbor.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is complete, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the library mirrors Lio&#039;s internal shift. However, the conflict is resolved through a low-friction conversation that offers answers too easily, lacking the trial-and-error needed to earn the resolution. The causality is functional but linear, moving from ritual to epiphany without significant obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong accumulative logic, where the environment, the architect’s constraint, and the narrator’s past commissions gather pressure that releases in the final letter. The closure ("slackening of invisible knots") is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels inevitable and earned, effectively reweighting the narrator's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Causal lens where the protagonist’s interference directly triggers the "Charged Poise" closure of the window rattling. The inciting incident (sale) and climax (broadcast) are perfectly linked, and the ending reconfigures the stakes without needing to resolve the external debate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, moving from arrival to the decisive descent with clear causal linkages. The closure—a descent into the unknown—lands with the tangible cost of leaving the safety of the sky. The spatial distortion is managed well without breaking the scene's legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the atmospheric setup to the execution of the art, ending in a Charged Poise. The closure—the slipping stone validating his theory—is effective, though slightly generic compared to the specificity of the rest of the piece. The "shudder" ending works well for the genre and length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure pivots beautifully on the "Protocol of Reversible Exile," which functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the entire setting. The causal chain from discovery to confrontation to action is tight. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "exile" is not escaped but weaponized, landing with distinct conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a "soft reset" resurrection that resolves the conflict neatly, lacking a deep felt or conceptual cost beyond the shattering of a magical object. The mechanics of the resolution feel slightly symmetric and convenient, reducing the narrative weight of the initial loss.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative drive, using the train setting to layer past and present until they converge. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the startup failure as an inherited loop, though the scene's static nature limits the sense of active tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the central conflict (the burden of the dreams) is resolved by a realization that dissolves the pain without a visible or felt cost. The causality is functional, but the ending fails the "cost proof test" for high-band consideration; the protagonist gains healing without having to sacrifice, endure, or renounce anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain from investigation to realization to action is tight, holding the Causal lens. The closure—offering a "warm" lie to break a frozen lie—provides a strong Resonant Reconfiguration of the premise with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scene flows tightly from arrival to revelation, adhering to a coherent situational lens. The closure ("cannot cut or keep") functions as a strong Charged Poise, creating a resonant conceptual cost for the empiricist character.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal lens. The ritual serves as a sturdy container for the transformation, and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cost is visibly transferred to Lio ("older") and the narrator ("steadier").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, using the physical examination of the amp to trigger a natural progression into backstory and realization. The closure—writing the subjective provenance on the tag—is a strong Decisive Change that acts as a Conceptual Repricing of the object. The reflection-heavy middle (Track A reflection-led) is well-anchored to the prop, keeping the present frame stable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    The causal chain is tight and inventive; the logic that the seed needs "a state of not knowing" (the guide's frozen wave) acts as a brilliant pivot that unifies the magic system with the character's analogical reasoning. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist enters a new, high-stakes negotiation with the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration; the reflection swap in the final lines demonstrates a tangible cost and lasting change for the narrator. The logic of the "smelting" holds perfectly within the established magical realism of the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the descent to the inspection and finally the confession. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the pearl responds to her vulnerability—lands effectively. The magical logic of the pearl is established early enough to make the climax feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from avoidance to confrontation via the accordion and graffiti. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator drops the "chronicler" mask to write the names—lands with visible emotional cost. The graffiti acting as a perfectly timed oracle is slightly convenient, but the internal causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path where the environment forces a change in the protagonist's methodology and goals. Closure is achieved through a strong &quot;Conceptual Repricing&quot; of the library's value (mercy vs. cowardice), though the mechanics of the final action—writing with ink after establishing that &quot;ink is exile&quot;—introduce a slight logical friction regarding the character's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is excellent: a Decisive Change (refusal to sign) coupled with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the violin cracking). The Causal lens holds firmly as the protagonist's decision precipitates the object's reaction. The narrative arc from the plant's warning to the coffee's confirmation to the act of writing is tight and logical.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc creates excellent structural pressure, using the earlier bodies to establish the magic's cost (the degrading chip) before the personal climax. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the "static" of death into a "clear tone" that reweights the relationship between the living and the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc follows a classic fable structure with a clear progression from ascent to realization. Causality is somewhat soft, relying on dream logic ("dreams left something tangible") and a guide who explains the rules, but the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the brother's role) lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, moving from the client's demand for certainty to a Resonant Reconfiguration of that desire into acceptance of nuance. The use of the mirror and chimes as active tools to force the turning point ensures the resolution is dramatized rather than just spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise, operating under a clear Situational/Accumulative lens. The closure serves as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the lesson's interruption forces a "hollow" realization in the apprentice that reweights the initial desire for vanishing with a visible existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, layering sensory details to build a "map of sound" that justifies the final Conceptual Repricing. The closure is resonant, transforming the initial motivation ("navigate without moving") into a realized state with the felt cost of ending the physical journey.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal trajectory from the inciting arrival of the keystone to the decisive closure of stepping into the mist. The ending qualifies as a Decisive Change with high physical and conceptual cost (abandoning safety and position). However, the specific mechanic of "mist walking" is introduced only in the final moments; while thematically linked to the "impossibilities" tag, its late arrival as a known-but-forgotten skill feels slightly convenient for resolving the cliffhanger.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully blending a realistic opening with a magical realism descent. The ending provides clear closure (Conceptual Repricing) where the protagonist's worldview is fundamentally altered, though the internal pacing is brisk.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight, driven by a Causal lens where the "backwards prophecy" directly forces a stance shift. Closure is a definitive Decisive Change (leaving the coins), supported by a legible cost. The resolution relies slightly on the convenience of the prophecy's explicit instruction, but the protagonist's agency in obeying it against reflex saves the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: setup, execution, success, reflection. While the "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the map provides technical closure, the absence of an obstacle or a "turn" where the plan is challenged makes the trajectory flat. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation lacks a spike in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, paying off the specific "dripping" setup with a resonant closure that feels both surprising and inevitable. The transition from the backstory of the bucket test to the climatic ritual is seamless and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative drive—following the trail of photos—transitions smoothly into a causal realization. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "levee" metaphor effectively shifts from a physical wall to a communal act of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear causal chain: preparation, failure of logic, pivot to intuition, and successful result. The mechanics of starlings refracting light are implausible but function coherently within the story's established magic system. Closure is definitive and resonant, fulfilling the promise of the premise with a clear Decisive Change in methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal arc is tight and effective, moving from signal detection to a decisive ethical choice with clear stakes. The closure lands a solid Decisive Change, with the "unseen revision" providing a resonant conceptual cost that aligns perfectly with the "watcher" lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands decisively as an Earned Stasis: the protagonist refuses the winning strike to preserve moral integrity, accepting the risk of erasure. The drive lens (Causal) holds firm, linking the internal need to feel with the external mechanic of memory combat. The narrative orientation is rapid and effective, grounding a surreal concept immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a logical progression to the climax facilitated by the "orthogonal" puzzle solving. The closure serves as a strong Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the escape room from a game to a gateway for something wilder, with the felt cost of alienating casual customers.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal chain is tight and imaginative, moving from the trigger (hourglass) to the action (blowers) to the result (laughter) with precision. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "work... will never be finished" reframes the victory as ongoing maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from disorientation to a decisive conceptual reconfiguration ("waiting while moving") that resolves the central tension. Closure lands with a felt conceptual cost, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration criteria perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing where the crozier’s authority is effectively redistributed. The "Resonant Reconfiguration" land well, though the low-threat level of the wardens places the burden of movement entirely on internal/magical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational arc: the inciting signal leads to diagnosis, which forces a high-stakes decision. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the narrator denies the city's immediate wish in favor of a safer, slower transformation. The causality of the "negotiation" is grounded well in the established magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the established radio mechanism to the final choice. While the closure is a functional Decisive Change, the climax relies on soft "sympathetic magic" (the circle forming) rather than strictly earned causality. The implications of choosing "home" remain slightly ambiguous regarding the initial goal of merging timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with exceptional clarity as a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator accepts a state of tension rather than a cure. The "sinew thread" mechanic creates a tight causal chain (weaving leads to spatial change leads to emotional confrontation) under a Hybrid lens. The cost is explicitly acknowledged ("pain will never quite leave"), satisfying the rubric's highest standard for closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, shifting the navigational paradigm from "pole star" to "edge geometry" with the chain link serving as the bridge. The drive lens (Situational/Textural) holds perfectly, escalating from the invitation to the visual epiphany without breaking causal logic. The cost—surrendering the certainty of surface navigation for the ambiguity of the deep—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective causal chain from the initial signal to the final delivery. The inciting incident (the tick) and the climax (the phone call) are distinct and impactful. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the emotional reality for the characters, though the cost to Eren is relatively low (emotional expenditure rather than tangible loss).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly paced within the word count, with a clear inciting move and rising action. The closure lands as a Decisive Change (choosing to leave with the sphere), though the cost feels somewhat low—choosing survival over "staying with the ghosts" is a natural biological imperative, softening the moral weight of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens where the accumulated pressure of failure meets the chance catalyst of the ink spill. While the ink spill is a "Newton's apple" coincidence, it triggers a memory-based realization rather than mechanically solving the plot, preserving agency. The closure lands with legible cost: the abandonment of the "perfect" reconstruction for a flawed, evolving reality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms the dying language into a new one, paying the price of braiding his own existence into the stone. The narrative logic holds the Accumulative/Textural lens firmly, transitioning smoothly from observation to interaction to synthesis. The "vertebrae" reveal serves as a deepening of the premise that earns the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from observation (arrowhead) to interaction (phone) to revelation (metamorphosis) with clear escalation. Closure is achieved through a decisive internal stance shift that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the mission. The Drive Lens (Hybrid Accumulative/Situational) holds firmly through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight and the closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible physical cost (the city's destruction). The locust shell functions as a fable-logic catalyst that effectively bridges the gap between the status quo and the climax without feeling like a cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from the mail drop to the delivery of the storm, holding the Situation/Causal hybrid lens effectively. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the potential energy of the storm is uncorked conceptually, with the cost (destruction vs. healing) made legible. The magical realism element is integrated smoothly into the established world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on a "magic fix" where the song repairs the physical world without cost. The "wrong turn" logic in a linear train corridor strains spatial plausibility. Closure is achieved, but it falls into "Symmetric Satisfaction," where the internal and external problems dissolve simultaneously without a felt price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure builds density effectively through the mapping motif, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. The realization that the "place" is a posture rather than a coordinate successfully reconfigures the premise with a clear conceptual cost—the obsolescence of her elaborate maps.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "fading world" mechanic creates a clear ticking clock, and the narrative moves efficiently under an accumulative lens. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the archive, though the resolution feels slightly mechanical as the sunrise simply "pours through" to solve the problem without a complication or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight and purposeful, utilizing the "viaduct as hinge" metaphor to frame the transition. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator pays the cost of safety to gain release, satisfying the rubric's requirement for a felt shift.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is decisive and resonant, with a clear Conceptual Repricing of memory's value. However, the opening hook ("the morning the tide forgot to turn") creates a logic friction with the procedural beat ("waited for low tide"); if the tide forgot to turn, waiting for a specific cycle phase implies a contradiction in the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is efficient and potent, moving from atmospheric setup to a decisive Conceptual Repricing where exile is reframed as weaponized memory. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the pain of forgetting is guaranteed as a feature, not a bug. Orientation and causality are flawless within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear structure from arrival to lesson to vision, with a coherent closure that acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The inciting incident (seeking work) transitions smoothly to the climax (planting the seed), though the lack of complications makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured, moving from the inciting delivery of the net to the climax of the final knot. The causal logic of the magic system (knots holding memories) is established well and paid off. The closure—a shift in the quality of the silence—lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost of "keeping the secret" feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative operates under a consistent lyric/textural lens where the associative leap from map to video feels thematically earned. Closure lands a decisive Conceptual Repricing (reopening for listening, not extraction) that recontextualizes the site with a clear conceptual cost. The structure efficiently moves from the physical object (map) to the digital memory (video) without losing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient, moving swiftly from discovery to decompression to decision. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration ("compromise that felt like mourning"), with the "physics" of the library providing a solid causal pivot for the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain: encoded art wakes the wall, the wall demands interaction, and Lio uses the tool to bridge the gap. Closure is effective as a Resonant Reconfiguration, releasing the atmospheric tension ("thunder finally rolled") and shifting Lio’s role. The pacing is steady, though the mechanism of the "ghost" waking is somewhat soft magic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, holding the Causal/Situational hybrid lens effectively. The closure acts as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "cost" is the spent opportunity used solely for wisdom rather than escape. The lock-picking mechanism relies on thematic causality (empathy), which fits the established tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is cohesive under a Situational lens, moving from observation to confirmation, but the inciting setup—volunteering to remain in a runaway gondola for an experiment—feels contrived. The closure works as a conceptual repricing of the drift, but the foundational logic of the situation relies heavily on suspended disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight Accumulative/Textural arc that transitions into a clean Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The demolition countdown provides coherent pressure, forcing the protagonist into a corner where she must trade completeness for compression. The ending lands with the felt cost of the unfinished work and a gain in perspective, satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative executes a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming a childhood game into a navigation system. The causal link between the starlings and the hopscotch board, while fantastic, follows consistent internal logic that pays off in a decisive closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural structure (arrive, test, apply skill), but a significant causality issue exists with the "bottle of melted frost." This item is introduced with specific, high-stakes rules ("uncap only once"), creating a Chekhov's gun expectation that is completely abandoned when the protagonist solves the climax using standard gears instead. This dangling thread weakens the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, escalating from initial warnings to a planetary fracture. Closure is achieved through a decisive evacuation that costs the survivors their homes and the ghost its connection (the bell), fulfilling the requirement for a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The surreal, dream-logic causality works well for the genre, with the substitution of the puppet head acting as a clear, pivotal Decisive Change. Closure is legible and resonant, offering a definitive "after" state (a softened world, the clock stopped) that justifies the buildup. The transition from physical lighthouse to metaphysical memory chambers is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure deftly moves from a specific instance of the routine (the girl) to a deepening of lore (the birds/blueprint), culminating in a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The revelation that the blueprint wants to be found recontextualizes the entire conflict without breaking causality. The pacing is efficient, handling the time jump without losing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story violates the short-form scope by summarizing months of work ("The next weeks," "Months later") instead of dramatizing a singular pivot point. This montage structure dissipates tension, turning the climax (the stress tests) into a reported fact rather than a felt event. While the ending offers a resonant image, the path to it relies on "and then" sequencing that bypasses the actual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the "clean slate" is recontextualized as a record of absence. The twist—that the tools reveal omissions rather than erasing history—is set up by the vendor's early distrust of the instructions. The cost is legible: the customer must accept a life of "fractures" rather than the relief of erasure, creating a resonant, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clean, ritualistic arc that fits the Accumulative lens perfectly. The causal link between the tidal pool patterns and the specific tile grounds the magic system, and the closure offers a satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fable-like structure is coherent and the closure lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, but the narrative arc lacks resistance. The "weeks passed" summary elides the struggle of the rehabilitation, and the choir's skepticism evaporates too quickly to generate causal density or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative traces a clear arc from mechanical setup to psychic overload to integration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lio accepts the conceptual cost of losing his singular biography to become the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where he integrates new knowledge—is legible. The structure follows a linear procedural path; while effective, the resolution feels inevitable from the start due to the character's pre-established competence, lacking a moment of doubt or deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory from preparation to inevitable success without a meaningful tightening of options or a reversal. A significant portion of the text is devoted to backstory exposition (the storm, the sculpture) that explains the premise but halts narrative momentum. The closure is a "success" state that feels structurally predictable rather than resonantly reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative traces a clear Accumulative arc, where the "translation of silence" provides a satisfying causal bridge to the climax. Closure is physically anchored by the deepened dent in the stone, validating the internal shift with a resonant external change (Resonant Reconfiguration). The "epiphany" moment with the rocks is slightly rapid, but the protagonist's expertise grounds it sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the impending fireworks as a ticking clock that parallels the internal pressure to open the journal. The pivot relies on a semi-magical interaction (listening to the book), which works within the established logic but leans heavily on metaphor to resolve the physical obstacle. Closure is decisive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a soft pivot where the antagonist yields to a poetic argument rather than leverage or pressure ("surrender to something older"). The connection between planting a corpse flower and saving the village is purely symbolic, lacking a sturdy causal or logical mechanism on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The trajectory is clear and the gravity inversion mechanic provides strong structural logic, but the climax relies on a convenient psychometric touch to deliver exposition. This "magic object" resolution bypasses deductive agency and cost, softening the sense of earned closure. The ending explains the mystery rather than forcing a character to reconfigure their stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative follows a tight, effective procedural arc where the investigation moves logically from data failure to physical simulation and finally to resolution. Causality is impeccable; the environment's shift directly explains the crash, and the "singular convergence" concept pays off the inciting mystery. Orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the wind as a living participant—lands with earned authority.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, ritualistic arc with a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the "sculpted hush" is achieved. Orientation and causality are precise, though the cost of the closure is largely conceptual (duty, patience) rather than a deeply felt personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The situational drive lens holds firmly, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Cael redefines his relationship to the relic. Closure is distinct and legible, though the linear descent-and-realization structure is somewhat safe.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from atmospheric setup to a distinct choice and a transformative climax. The "deliberate ambiguity" concept is integrated as a plot mechanic that actively disorients the protagonist, justifying the retrospective narration in the middle. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist’s grief is recontextualized as trivial against the "dense geometry" of collective experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from anxiety to a decisive change in professional philosophy. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the decision to "stay longer," though the causal link between the vibrating pendant and the specific knowledge of "slower time layers" relies heavily on genre permissiveness rather than logical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, using the "shifted hush" to drive the investigation of the frost. The closure lands as a valid Conceptual Repricing ("objects only hold what we refuse to feel"), but the plot lacks a significant obstacle or reversal; the town yields to the narrator's proof with convenient ease, smoothing out the narrative tension too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is decisive and resonant; the magical logic of the puzzle demanding the tapestry operates smoothly within the fable frame. The transition from assembly to magical portal is handled with earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the reshaping of the stone. However, the resolution feels slightly swift; the mechanism of "speaking" to the stone solves the problem without a significant causal obstacle or complication testing the protagonist first.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arc is efficient, moving from mystery to decisive action with clear on-page closure (cutting the threads). The significant brevity (~440 words) forces a rapid pace where the loop's weight is established via dialogue rather than dramatized repetition, slightly reducing the earned pressure of the break.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is a tight, flawless single scene that moves efficiently from the physical climb to the emotional realization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the modified stone signal physically manifests his internal change. The cost is felt—he has surrendered his safety as a bystander to accept the burden of the "we."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear situational lens where the "death of the last newspaper" triggers the lighthouse's response. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the light's purpose from sea to sky with conceptual cost. The causality is poetic but coherent within the story's established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a premise (heart as magnet) to a test, and finally to a Conceptual Repricing (heart as mirror). The closure lands with a clear reweighting of the protagonist's understanding. The pacing is steady, though the orientation relies heavily on atmospheric assertion rather than grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly, but the central turning point—the sextant healing itself in moonlight—is a passive solution that bypasses agency. The progression feels more like a sequence of fortunate events than a causal chain under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear restoration arc, but the resolution relies on a "soft reset" where singing a song magically fixes the realm's deep structural problem without complication. The "Silence Years" backstory block occupies significant space (~15%) without anchoring fully in a present-tense tactical choice, slowing momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a standard therapeutic arc where a magical guide explains the problem and provides the solution (the book), rendering the protagonist somewhat passive. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the resolution comes from new information (the brother wasn't mad) rather than a costly decision or action by Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is a clean, single-scene vignette that achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration. The consumption of the bread serves as an irreversible action that forecloses the possibility of "miraculous" absolution, leaving Elias with a paid cost (the loss of the artifact) and a shifted stance. The pacing allows the weight of the object to accumulate naturally before the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight, effective causal chain from the inciting alarms to the resonant closure. The climax relies on a distinct realization that pivots the action from maintenance to amendment, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual weight. The pacing is efficient and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal line from the purchase to the revelation, achieving a high-quality Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The "sound of trust breaking" is not abstract but grounded in a specific, heartbreaking auditory detail (knuckles on a duffel), satisfying the closure requirement with visible emotional cost. The pacing holds tension effectively within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where sensory density increases toward a legible closure (joining the group). The causal link between the taste-compass and movement is handled well, though the climax relies heavily on the prop doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving efficiently from the theater to the cave and into the memory. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of his relationship to his art, supported by the physical act of hanging the portrait. The structure supports the emotional weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident is strong, but the middle section lacks significant causal complications; the journey to the observatory is unimpeded. The resolution relies on the found object functioning as a convenient key, which softens the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, utilizing a Causal lens where the girl's arrival necessitates the specific tuning of the tower. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the loss of Lio's voice is balanced by the sculpture's enduring "symphony of truth" with clear conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal lens where the environmental pressure (magnetic shift) directly forces the protagonist's tactical escalation. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "controlled burn" is not just a metaphor but a literalized mechanism that alters the status quo with visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure relies on a "deus ex machina" where a legal conflict is resolved by a magical event (listening causes cement to crumble), followed by an unearned victory where developers simply back away. The ending fails the cost test; the protagonists gain everything without paying a visible or felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from descent to discovery to reconfiguration under a consistent Hybrid lens (accumulative atmosphere + causal discovery). The "hangman's dice" mechanism serves as a strong navigational and thematic spine, though its "probability breaking" borders on convenient magic realism. Closure lands with a resonant conceptual repricing of the lab's purpose, though the immediate cost of defying the handlers is more implied than viscerally dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an Accumulative lens, gathering density from the failing lanterns to the final experiment. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the invisible mechanics of the world are made visible with a felt physical cost ("chest filled with wet sand"). Orientation is precise, anchoring the surreal events in a tangible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, effectively translating a ritual process into a global shift. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) works well, establishing the erasure of memory as a tangible cost ("holes in memory"), though the sequence leading there is somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The two-shard structure (meeting and meteor shower) bridged by a summary transition fits the length perfectly, maintaining momentum. Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the "denials" of the building as a necessary condition of tenancy. The narrative arc creates a legible before/after state regarding the protagonist's perception of their home.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where Neris shifts from avoidance to "archiving," paying a felt cost in endurance. The structure is weakened by the Caretaker's convenient arrival, which functions as an expository bridge rather than a causal complication, reducing the protagonist's agency in the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly paced, moving from the tension of the act to the confrontation and resolution. The closure (signing his own name) creates a clear Decisive Change with visible risk. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, though the resolution of the external threat relies slightly on Sevran's convenient benevolence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from ritual to response to realization (Conceptual Repricing). The "progressive disclosure" mechanism provides structure, though the climax relies on the environment explaining the theme to the protagonist rather than her forcing the answer through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from dream to revelation to choice, with closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the woman's burden. The "psychic detective" mechanic—touching the globe to instantly download the corporate conspiracy—is efficient but slightly lowers the sense of earned discovery. The ending successfully establishes a felt cost (betraying family legacy) without needing to dramatize the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, using the tea whisk lesson to bridge the narrator's doubt and the final epiphany. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the narrator’s internal view of their labor shifts with tangible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tight and propulsive, moving from the shed's investigation to the orchard's excavation without wasted motion. The closure is a quintessential Decisive Change/Charged Poise, where the discovery of the "stillpoint" forces a high-stakes ethical pivot that recontextualizes his entire mission.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an established stasis through an intrusion to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure—standing in the rain, accepting the "bargain"—lands with clear conceptual cost (loss of self-determination for knowledge). The pacing allows the conversation to breathe before the final image solidifies the change.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a closure that reconfigures the protagonist's stance. While the woman hearing the box "on the wind" is a fable-logic coincidence that borders on convenience, the resolution—mixing the sounds to create a new shared memory—lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean Situational arc: a specific atmospheric pressure forces a technical intervention. The causal chain is strong (ice shift → frequency drift → adaptation). Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), restoring balance with a tangible sense of relief ("exhausted, forgiven breath").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is competent but linear, relying on the "wise mentor" trope where the protagonist is passive. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing (valuing slowness over speed), but the turning point is external (touching the basin) rather than driven by the protagonist's actions. Causality is soft; events happen because the teacher allows them.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient, utilizing the lantern as a clear pivot point to bridge the inciting incident and the climax. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (the decision to report the truth), though the supernatural vision resolves the ambiguity somewhat conveniently, reducing the protagonist's active agency in uncovering the truth before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical repair of the heart forces Elias to reframe his moral stance. The causality is tight, with the diagnosis of the object directly unlocking the protagonist's internal block.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving from the inciting arrival to the conceptual climax without wasted motion. The closure lands as a powerful "Resonant Reconfiguration," where the world itself updates its state ("shuddered politely"). The causality of the kaleidoscope-as-interface driving the launch is distinct and rewarding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear, moving from the inciting observation of "713" to the resolution in the subnet. However, the climax relies on a soft sci-fi trope where a poetic query ("treating silence as content") yields hard data coordinates, which weakens the mechanical causality of the solution. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's understanding of "deletion" with the felt cost of complicit silence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from negotiation to a resonant reconfiguration of the terms. The resolution relies heavily on fable-logic—assuming the Keepers will accept a "moral claim" argument—which works for the tone but softens the causal hardness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly controlled, utilizing the "mandatory waiting week" to credibly compress time and build pressure. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding of the "sound of endings" is fundamentally repriced into a sound of persistence. The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds firmly from the opening wait to the final vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing a situational lens to reframe the woman's crisis. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing ("rhyme instead of overlap") that feels earned and resonant, satisfying the rigorous closure requirement with intellectual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight, with the connection between the merchant's denial and the city's instability instantly legible under a hybrid situational/causal lens. The closure lands a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration: the walker's intervention alters the rules of prophecy to secure stability, delivering a clear conceptual outcome with visible cost to the merchant.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds density, moving from the initial hesitation to the specific encounter with the boy, then widening into a communal montage. However, the closure relies on a summary compression ("By the third day...") that glides into resolution rather than landing a distinct, dramatized final beat with immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is impeccable; the cracked crystal serves as the perfect causal link between the summons (inciting incident) and the resolution. Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise, reconfiguring the "hush" from a refuge into "barely audible armor," satisfying the drive lens with undeniable conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure works well for this fable-like narrative, leading naturally to the conceptual repricing at the end. The transition to meeting Mara via driftwood arrows relies on dream logic that fits the tone but loosens the causal chain; however, the closure successfully reconfigures the premise of memory and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean Situational/Causal hybrid arc where the inciting incident (quake plus flare) immediately narrows options. The closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration; the "stolen clarity" reweights the struggle from mere survival to a legacy-defining victory. Causality is tight, with every technical move by Ilias responding directly to the escalating environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds a mood of transition, moving cleanly from the arrival to the song to the silence. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration ("room change"), though the total lack of resistance makes the arc feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is precise, moving from a distinct inciting incident (the spoons) to a clear climax and resolution. The closure lands as a "Conceptual Repricing" where the protagonist's worldview is irrevocably altered, satisfying the narrative drive with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and potent, moving from a mundane morgue to a metaphysical rescue with earned dream logic. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the crumbling body serving as a tangible, high-cost proof of the successful "correction" and the shift in Mara's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure effectively braids the physical act of polishing with the backstory of the grandmother, leading to a resonant closure. The transition out of the flashback ("memory loosens its grip") is functional but slightly mechanical. The ending successfully reconfigures the emotional reality of the children, satisfying the "light without fire" promise.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene possesses a clear arc and legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the trajectory is linear and low-stakes. The resolution—planting moss as healing—feels inevitable rather than the result of a hard-won navigational choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Situational drive lens is handled well, with the surreal logic holding firm from the inciting note to the riverfront; closure arrives via a clear Conceptual Repricing that reweights the protagonist's artistic philosophy with legible intent.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the solution (singing) works without complication or unintended consequence. The "cruelties" mentioned in the backstory imply a constraint that is never dramatized or tested in the present action. The ending is a "soft reset" that resolves the problem perfectly without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, linear procedural structure that fits the Accumulative/Textural lens perfectly. The closure—the successful sealing of the map—lands with the weight of the established stakes, providing a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration that justifies the slow pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to a specific, mechanically grounded solution (the mirrors and angles). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the device’s function is redefined. The logic of the repair blends the physical and the metaphysical seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Situational" drive, building pressure through the accumulation of burdens toward a personal climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost is explicit ("no less burden"), creating a satisfying, non-trivial ending that validates the magic system's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative structure is tightly controlled by the kettle’s boil, creating a natural, urgent window for the decision without artificial ticking clocks. Closure is definitive and lands with a Decisive Change (the cut) that conceptually reprices her grief from a wound to a tool. The orientation is immediate, and the causal chain from memory to action is unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with the force of a Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator empties themselves while the ghost becomes "crowded," fundamentally altering their dynamic. Causality holds strictly under the situational/causal lens, with the negotiation serving as a logical climax to the established setup. The orientation within the surreal logic is handled with assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully executes a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the building's state is meaningfully altered. While the logistics of rerouting commercial plumbing with only a headlamp and found tape are slightly convenient (lowering the causality score), the accumulation of effort and the final image land effectively under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal trajectory where a specific trigger (the clock's cough) forces a choice that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of the sanctuary's purpose—from a hiding place to an archive—earned by his act of repair and the accompanying risk. The structure is tight, with the ending logically and emotionally derived from the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal/Situational hybrid line, moving from rumor to investigation to a decisive confrontation. The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise; the protagonist refuses the safe transaction in favor of a dangerous exposure, creating a legible cost (safety) and a clear stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with weak causality; events happen sequentially without necessary linkage. The closure is a soft thematic affirmation (Conceptual Repricing) rather than a decisive change, and the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and purposeful, moving from a mysterious commission to a shared, resonant understanding (Conceptual Repricing). The pacing aligns perfectly with the walk, allowing the backstory to emerge naturally within the present action. The closure is legible and impactful, reframing the initial premise without breaking the established fable-like logic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is tight and efficient, moving from a distinct status quo to a decisive closure without wasted motion. The arrival of the egg acts as a sharp inciting incident that logically forces the climax, and the closure lands with a clear Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing of the prince's role. The cost—breaking laws and abandoning his duty to the syndicates—is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving from the fire line to the specific encounter at the lagoon. Causality holds well; Maris's decision resolves the boy's paralysis, allowing the physical rescue. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the coin exchange reweights the meaning of the "curse."

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and the fable logic holds consistently from the dry basins to the final release. The closure is decisive and earned via the established mechanism of the protagonist's specific nature (her skepticism as the key), satisfying the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is elegant, moving from atmospheric setup to a crisis of faith triggered by the "familiar constellations," resolving in a meaningful Earned Stasis. The closure is earned through the specific memory and the re-application of that wisdom to the present task.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("So they began, night after night") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, which dissipates scene tension and compresses the timeline excessively for this length. The closure lands on a resonant image, but the impact is blunted by the explicit explanation of the metaphor in the final lines, removing the interpretive work required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The situational drive works well, using the "kneeling" of time to force a necessary stance shift. Closure is distinct and earns the decision to share the burden, though the magical realism element (the pause) resolves the pressure somewhat conveniently by providing a dedicated space for epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear accumulative arc toward a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the narrator redefines his role from planting to "cutting threads." Causality is generally tight, though the mechanics of a ghost feeling the "heat of [his] thigh" creates a slight ontological wobble regarding his physical state.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving cleanly from the general burden to a specific crisis (mines vs. famine) and an earned resolution. The closure (a Decisive Change in approach) lands with a clear conceptual cost—trading binary safety for a demanding, complex flexibility—and the causal logic holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure moves cleanly from the procedural magic system to a situational crisis via the broadcast warning. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration from isolation to shared guardianship, lands with clear thematic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scene follows a clear, situational arc that moves from the cessation of the chair to the final release of ash. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "mirage of safety" is priced in, and the shared moment of fragility feels earned and final.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece relies almost entirely on iterative summary ("Every evening," "They say") and flashback, failing to establish a singulative scene with a specific "now." While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of a present-tense causal arc makes this a static vignette rather than a narrative story.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing an accumulative drive that builds trust over time to a specific closure scene. The ending creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship through the prop, landing with earned emotional weight that justifies the montage-like middle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under an accumulative/textural lens, moving from dormancy to a "resonant reconfiguration" of the greenhouse. The inciting incident (the alignment/seed) causally drives the climax (pruning), and the closure lands with the visible cost of the consumed seed and the labor invested. The ending feels earned and transforms the space, satisfying the closure requirement with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and closes with a decisive change, but the mechanism of resolution relies on convenient exposition ("Granddad... wired things so"). This explanation of the rules via dialogue slightly flattens the mystery into a mechanical puzzle rather than an organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from observation to ritual to a decisive crisis (the storm/shard) and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the physical act of moving the bed answers the house's "question" with visible cost. The logic holds perfectly under the Accumulative/Textural lens, where density builds to a breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is decisive and structurally sound, with the destruction of the city logically resolving the threat of calcified truth. The causal link between the visitor's arrival and the statue's choice to destroy the sanctuary is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situation-driven arc where the environment forces a crystallization of the protagonist's stance. The rupture serves as a perfect inciting incident that literalizes the protagonist's obsession, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of "texture"—lands with legible cost (the certainty of loss). The climax relies slightly on the environment acting upon Arin (the crack closing before he can act) rather than his own agency forcing the turn, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "intention-action-success" path with low causality and zero narrative tension. The resolution relies entirely on the magical premise functioning perfectly on the first attempt without complication. The closure lacks a legible on-page cost or sacrifice, resulting in a "Just So" story that feels too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative arc that pivots into a Decisive Change at the closure. The transition from observation to action is well-structured, with the "opera glass" moment serving as an effective catalyst. The ending feels earned, resolving the tension between preservation and loss with a concrete new path.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving from arrival to a decisive change that alters the future. However, the discovery of the pivotal tool (the yoyo) on a windowsill feels convenient, relying on video-game logic rather than earned causality, which softens the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving logically from the inciting entry to the climactic confrontation in the mirror. Closure is decisive and resonant; the exchange of the clasp and the alteration of the Polaroid provide a clear, earned state change. The time-loop mechanic with the handwriting is functional, if slightly familiar, but serves the closure well.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and propulsive, moving efficiently from the inciting swell to the stabilizing resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "dub" restores balance, creating a legible before/after state. However, the resolution feels somewhat linear; the protagonist applies her skill and the problem is solved immediately without a complication or twist that forces a harder second choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is strong, moving efficiently from observation to political failure to direct intervention. Closure is decisive and resonant. A minor timeline friction exists between the opening line ("The day the harbor gate finally rusted shut") and the description of the gate as already "eaten to scabbed lace by salt and time," which muddies the temporal relationship to the expedition two summers prior.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent; the shift from "guiding star" to "night vision" is a decisive stance with clear conceptual cost, destroying social comfort for truth. The scene builds coherent pressure under a Situational/Causal lens to a resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative drive, using the ritual of repair to build pressure against the rising tide. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the repair site from a ruin into a secret archive. Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure fits the scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal link between the blackout (removing "watchers") and the investigation is logical, effectively enabling the plot. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the library's history, though the discovery of the specific folio in the "narrow aisle" feels slightly fortuitous/convenient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is a tightly constructed ritual that moves efficiently from the inciting shadow detachment to the transformative closure. The transition from the "gem polishing" of memory to the glass-blowing and finally to the origami cranes creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is impeccable, utilizing the cooling circuit breakers as a tight narrative window. The closure acts as a Decisive Change, where the protagonist utilizes the established mechanics (perturbation) to reclaim agency in a way that feels inevitable yet surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on an extreme coincidence—that the random stars in the sky perfectly align with the missing gaps on a specific typography chip—to resolve the plot. This breaks causal credibility for a literary realism piece. The resolution feels handed to the protagonist by the environment rather than earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal arc leading to a valid Decisive Change (switching from forging to decoding). The realization relies on a convenient coincidence—finding the specific symbol matching the watch immediately—but the structural logic holds, and the closure effectively reconfigures the protagonist's mission.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from a tense setup to a complication (the brother) and a decisive resolution. Closure is strong, with the protagonist's choice landing with undeniable cost on the page. The logic of the "untethering" moment creates a pause that effectively bridges the internal decision and external action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive physical turn that mirrors the internal realization, satisfying the Situational drive lens. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist accepts the "cold steady rain" and the "imperfect time" of the heart, paying a felt cost of admitted cowardice. The narrative arc from the inciting text message to the turnaround at the pylons is tight and causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to re-absorb the "sins" creates an undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. The linear trajectory (City -> Stadium -> Tunnel -> Lake) is tightly causal, with the "time traveler" ball serving as a brilliant bridge between past intent and future action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal; the ritual setup pays off directly in the transformation (Decisive Change) with no loose threads. The cost of the magic is foreshadowed and then levied on the page with brutal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual preparation to vision to resolution. The ending lands a Conceptual Repricing, but the climax is somewhat passive; Lysander watches a vision and receives an answer rather than forcing a result through a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the concept is strong, the structure relies heavily on expository summary and habitual time ("Sometimes," "More than once") rather than a grounded scene. The transition to the specific climax ("On the day the star...") feels abrupt after so much backstory, making the closure feel like the end of a synopsis rather than a fully dramatized story.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative flow is strong, but the inciting incident relies on "intuition" ("detour without reason") rather than active choice, and the climax is summarized ("Children would chase...") rather than dramatized. The resolution—villagers perfectly following the bugs during a panic—requires a suspension of disbelief that leans heavily on fable logic rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and efficient, moving from the blackout (opportunity) to the arrival of the message (confirmation) to the execution (closure). The ending provides a decisive change with a resonant conceptual cost—the locks "forgetting" their function rewrites the fort's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration; the return of friction is physically felt through the "scrape of stone," paying off the setup with visceral cost. The causal logic of the ritual holds firm within the story's mythic framework, anchoring the abstract concept in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is clean and effective, utilizing the "one hour" constraint to build situational pressure toward the climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the external phenomenon recontextualizes the protagonist’s internal grief, though the linear progression holds few surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story relies heavily on expositional summary to establish Darius's method ("When rivals came... he would ask") rather than dramatizing a full iteration of it. While the closure works as a moment of Charged Poise, the high ratio of backstory to present action drags on the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective arc where established backstory and props converge to resolve the scene's primary threat. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, as the characters successfully navigate the external pressure using their established tools and traits.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong, with the film reel serving as a clever, foreshadowed mechanism for the transition. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned, though the pivot from resistance to acceptance in the climax happens somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is sturdy, moving from environmental anomalies to the council's ultimatum and finally the dream-quest. The ending qualifies as a strong Conceptual Repricing; Kael reconfigures the value of the "seed" and the island's history with a legible intellectual and emotional cost. The pacing effectively utilizes the looming monsoon to force the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative flows smoothly under a Situational lens, but the resolution relies on a "ghost ex machina"—finding a second piece of lace he doesn't remember placing—which solves the emotional conflict too conveniently. The drive is linear but passive; the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands, but the causal path to it feels externally guided rather than internally forged.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the image of narrowing leaks while accepting perpetual damp re-weights her scientific method and emotional stance with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each filter, vine, and puddle accretes meaning until the final cadence. No orientation debt; who-where-when are anchored by line three. The single tightening beat (deciding to let the greenhouse stay partly wet) is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist steps beyond the ruins, re-weighted by the ledger’s arrow-trace. Accumulative-textural lens is stable—density of frost/charcoal/glass imagery tightens stakes rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear by line 4; shards are legible. The withheld name of the smuggler is purposeful elision, not knowledge cheat; still, the DC/RR beat is quiet—felt cost is oblique, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: silence accumulates as emotional data; the conservatory becomes a loom weaving heat-auras into unheard song. Orientation clean within 80 words; causal logic from ferry to tuning-fork case to civic score is unbroken. Closure is a Charged Poise—bridges, hospitals, shelters “thrum with chords” yet remain mute; conceptual cost is undeniable. Persistent constraint—the Quiet—shapes every tactic. One scaffold tic (“They had joked then, drinking coffee…”) is forgivable and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias stands inside impossible shelves, implicitly accepting lifelong servitude to shelve the uproar of unended lives; the cost is the foreclosing of surface rest he once peddled. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (salt crust, cracked glass, barnacled arches) thickens until meaning tilts. Orientation is clean by 60 words; no teleporting props. One micro-turn—boat sliding through dry water—escalates stakes without causal rupture. Persistent constraint (the underwater archive now owns his days) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s bell-ring reweights the anonymous covenant into audible mutual debt—felt cost is the future silence she now protects. Causal lens holds: because donations stayed secret, therefore Mara must protect the secrecy with ritual, narrowing her own options. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”), transitions clean, no prop teleport. One persistent constraint—sanctions-thinned food—shapes every tactic and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared exhale reconfigures both bodies and the night air, cost legible in the lantern that exits Arun’s ribs. Causal chain holds—crystal → camera → corridor → boy—each step a because/therefore narrowing option to act now or stay sealed. Orientation is clean inside 120 words: twilight viaduct, camera box, monk parcel name the who-where-when. No lens ambiguity; the final image freezes the new gravitational field of released love.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist steps into a pupil-like water that refuses reflection, dissolving outline and chronology; the cost is the erasure of self as separate observer, legible in “our histories smeared into one quaking reverie.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat adds sensory density (photos bleaching, sap shoe-prints, halo flickers) until the lattice image re-weights the premise. Causality is internal but coherent—touching the fragment → bridges rise → time ricochets → final step. No orientation debt; who/where/when taught early and payoff justifies initial disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: seed vault → cuffs → piano key sequence → vault door/ruin toggle. The arrow’s circuit-map is taught early and paid off in the final bench manipulation; closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s whispered redirection reweights risk without detonating the building. Cost is legible: her knowledge might still die with her if the wall falls wrong. One transition (piano hauled forward) is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prototype’s dual-note reweights the kitchen memory, showing the narrator’s complicity. Causal chain holds: because he harvested absences, he can hear both betrayals; therefore he accepts the device cannot erase guilt. Cost is palpable in the lacquer image—new memory layered over cracked wood. Accumulation pattern taught early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the jar refills with miniature burning faces, reweighting every prior theft under a moral price the narrator can no longer externalize. Causal lattice holds throughout—because the stranger arrives, therefore the jar must be opened, therefore the archive of gazes is returned as irrefutable evidence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the “aquarium of light” image crystallizes meaning without breaking pattern. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“Emerald Station”) and paid off when the platform reverts to “ordinary night,” satisfying the waiver test.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the console-cradled glass vessel reconfigures the abandoned control room from command node to invitation zone, cost paid by the narrator’s “cautious heart shift.” Accumulative lens holds: thawing ice, dripping panels, and amber glass tighten the stake—containment becomes porous inquiry—without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and stay stable; no penalty. One meaningful deepening at the bookmark burial suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she will walk into the office shaking, holding her bruised résumé like a protest sign. The before/after is legible—studio erasure → self-authored visibility—and the cost is felt in the same breath that names it. Causal chain holds: erased file → library exile → cipher decryption → stance crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rusted library under stars we used for night shoots”); no ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the starless moment reconfigures navigation from celestial to auricular, and the cost—total relinquishment of external light—hits on the final line. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added silence (storm, gate creak, dying star) layers density until the map becomes shelter, a pattern taught early and paid off when the hall stays dry. Causality is intact—oracle summoned because charts will fail, map drawn because silence accumulated, captain yields because map offers dark grammar. No lens ambiguity, no orientation debt; the hinge of infinite night is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop deposits one more sensory flake until the violin’s tone collapses the pattern into an aerial double-exposure that reweights HEPA-3’s cognition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the loop stutters into real dusk and the robot’s perceptual grid is permanently altered; cost is the puddled violin and the frost on his fingers—undeniable on-page traces. Causality is intact: the 612th touch is motivated by accumulated detail, not authorial sleight. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared silence with the stranger crystallizes a new rule—transparency can exist inside the surveillance archive—at visible cost to her anonymity. Causal chain holds: contraband tickets → lens trick → recognition of mirrored isolation → wordless confession. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“campus perimeter”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the projector lens is introduced, used, and re-offered in a clean loop.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the maze “answers” Elias via a living pulse that mirrors his own, re-weighting the premise that only data counts. Causality holds: each commemorative act (wind-chime, dusk-scented flower) is traceable to a visitor smile he witnessed earlier. The reflective passages stay anchored to present-tense stimuli (marble polishing, hedge trimming) and tilt his next micro-choice. No orientation debt; who/where/when arrive within the first 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism hums and time is believed sideways, but the cost is conceptual, not personally felt by Ilen. Causal chain is thin—lever nudge → stabilized dreams—without intermediate obstacle or price to him. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens holds as Accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: he accepts the ghost-score with visible cost—his bass above dark water, rebellion now shared. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each water-warped page intensifies the mutiny motif until the final image reweights silence itself. Orientation is swift; the closed opera house and rising flood are anchored by line 3. Causality is thin—why tonight?—but the pattern coherence overrides that gap at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s admission “the weight is mine to carry” crystallizes options—she must descend with the truth—while the green dawn reweights every prior image under conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: oracle’s memory (because) forces the confession (therefore) that forecloses erasure. Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tunnel becomes a shared confessional, the rosary-wrapped valve a secular altar, and the narrator’scatalogue of names reweights “truth” from private burden to mutual artifact. Causal linkage is tight—Evan’s need to prove innocence → tunnel → valve → naming ritual—each beat alters options. The reflective backstory block (radio psychics) is anchored to present stimuli (the metallic rhythm) and tilts the narrator’s stance, so BRR exception holds; no orientation debt. The ending’s cost is felt: the narrator’s skepticism is forced to house a communal ghost, a stasis that forecloses earlier dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s surfacing and the keeper’s seated vigil re-weight “witness without judgment” from detached safety to participatory listening. Cost is legible—the buried archive ruptures the city above, an irreversible breach. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each footprint inks futures, density tightening until paper path and river merge. Transition from catacombs to obsidian refuge is spatially disorienting, but the warp is taught early via origami fold and pays off at the end, so Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory pattern (sage scent, light ladders, eclipse dusk) thickens until the hush re-configures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30; causality is atmospheric tightening, not event-chain. Closure is a Charged Poise—the ring-of-fire image conceptually reweights “ordinary magic” and grief in one visible cost. No loops, no ambiguity, no props teleport; the keepsake returns metaphorically in the final image, satisfying the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of wall-absorbed memories tighten into the final CR that stories outlast dreamers. Orientation is immediate; silo-library, post-human era, and Brann’s quest are anchored by line 4. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “old ones were enough work” reweights the premise that new dreams are needed. One transition (diary → tapestry) is legible and keeps the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the beam is rewritten, options narrowed, “the island seemed to hold its breath, then exhale into a different, sharper cadence.” Causal lens holds throughout—each fortune-manifestation tightens stakes until the protagonist hijacks the signal. Cost is visible in the final image of him “still wiping glasses in the dark,” now permanently fused to the whispering light. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice tightens: loop pedal → captured demonic laugh → mirrored contradiction → slip. Orientation is nailed by word 50 (abandoned chapel, dusk). Closure is a Charged Poise: the demon “slipped free,” leaving Jonas in blue-lined stillness that forecloses choir-and-candle exorcism forever. Cost is the chapel’s dimensional anchor contracting around his private ritual—visible constraint in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fortune, line on glass, and chamber of shell layers density until the mirrored horizon reconfigures from motif to usable tool. Closure is a Charged Poise: the invisible baton raised in predawn glow crystallizes Eli’s stance—conductor of coincidences—while the visible cost (exhaustion, solitude, unrecognized labor) is undeniable. No orientation debt; transitions are fluid lyric shards inside one continuous vigil. Pattern taught early (fortune-as-zipper) and paid off in final silent music.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the tablet’s drop reweights the premise—algorithmic multiplicity is rejected for singular embodiment. Causal lattice holds: each revisited room seals a fracture, narrated as “because” links (“Each choice he remade bled…”). The mosaic structure is taught by the third paragraph (“rooms bloomed and collapsed…”), transitions legible via corridor/step-through logic. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secured by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the needleless phonograph rewrites silence into music felt in bone, undeniable social cost for the children. Accumulative lens holds—each drum’s sigh layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Eira stood among the drums”). Only micro-slippage: “backward recorded songs” logic is asserted not demonstrated, a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight: because the zone is rogue → pigeons fly unmonitored → therefore the archivist receives the tube → therefore he redefines his vocation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “alone but aligned” reweights every prior risk with visible vocational cost. One hairline slip: the phrase “tonight, though, the air was unnervingly clear” withholds the prior-followed context until after the courtyard arrival, a micro-delay that nicks orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias lets the wave hit, crystallizing a before/after stance with ultraviolet-lit tears as felt cost. Causal chain holds—Mara’s vial → scent → lamp → memory → tears—each beat tightening options under the Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (aromatic caution) shapes every tactic until foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrival of beings → stalled road → grotto → layered conversation → reweighted choice. Closure is a Charged Poise: options are reconfigured (“the choice was mine alone”) with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. One minor causality gap: rope’s prior use is told, not shown, softening the symbolic price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inverted bowl converts begging into listening, reweighting the premise with undeniable social and aesthetic cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of unfinished phrases, pumps that hate finishing cycles—and the final image crystallizes that cadence. Orientation is swift; anchors (harbor city, drained canal, porthole balcony) are clear by line 60. One micro-turn: Mara’s card flips the hush open for Elio, deepening stakes without breaking pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: amber density, static charge, and bottled moods keep thickening until the final image of “scaffolds to climb.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the half-truth empathy is now inside her, re-weighting future verdicts; cost is felt in the ominous warning she has already accepted. Causality holds: because she inhales the counterfeit, therefore her static arranges into readable patterns—an irreversible perceptual shift. No orientation debt; grotto, dusk, and roles are anchored within first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: mis-delivered letter → Elias’s curiosity → library encounter → co-planned reading series, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “new commerce” of gratitude is conceptually repriced on-page (“slowly learn a new commerce”). Cost is legible: Elias commits money/time and publicly realigns his identity. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Stay and scatter” reweights the premise, making the web-sculpture inevitable. The causal lens holds—three-day stay rule → find tag → co-create—though escalation is gentle, a single deepening rather than successive turns. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 15). Cost is felt in the final image (“small colors claiming space”) but not yet paid on-page; the slight softness keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: pendant-hum → canal keeper yields passage → pendant-knot → time-sculpt → choice to release echoes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty-hand line reweights the whole quest, foreclosing profit or control with undeniable social cost (client unpaid, keeper’s warning fulfilled). One transition (gondola → solo exit) is cleanly anchored. No set-up amnesia; object states track.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Corren abandons the drag-back spell and accepts the hollow space, felt cost in the orchard’s resumed drip “almost kind.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echoed images (glass eyes / stag leap / extra bowl) reweights grief into vocation. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” is named, not dramatized, a fractional abstraction at the pivot beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marrow’s realization “he was visible now… through their own awakened senses” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean—tape find → playback → stranger’s collapse—tightening once. Orientation is swift; no penalties. The single beat of escalation suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lucid Conceptual Repricing: the linden leaf’s ember reweights the entire rule-set, making surrender legible as the new tactic. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each observed detail of plant adaptation tightens the pattern until the spiral burn inside her chest becomes the unavoidable image. Cost is unmistakable: “without her consent” and “knees gave” are on-page sentences where options narrow to mud and green hush. No slips touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (vanished tide, insect in amber, rain trails) layers density until the final exchange reweights survival itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara walks toward city lights carrying both canvases and the cost of trading time-fossil for water; options narrow to that bleak trade. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final “exchange of hungers.”

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s transfer reweights the stake from grand prophecy to luminous ordinary acts, and Lyra’s bow makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each musical echo thickens the pattern until the cave’s chord “sharpens by teeth” and forces the role-swap. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the “unseen forces” could be slightly more foreshadowed to earn a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The closure lands as a Charged Poise: Caven’s tremulous note reconfigures the harbor’s silence into an unsure question, reweighting every prior gap. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marae’s fragment-compiling ritual cumulatively summons the crowd and Caven; no single cause but pattern density tightens. Orientation is clean by line 6; the ivory/missing-teeth metaphors teach the bruised-retreat disorientation that later pays off. Cost is conceptual—music now dare exist again—but felt in the collective wince of that “unsure music”; sufficient for 8-band, though not the visceral forfeiture that would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: cracks → punch → doorway → station. Each “because” tightens options; the punch’s tug is the final motivator. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s silence-map reweights his lifelong profession—he will now have to chart the unspoken. Cost is legible: “breath that shook the dust in his lungs” and the conductor’s warning that he must publish a way back.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the notebook full of shifting symbols and the narrator seated in predawn gray crystallize a new stance—wonder housed inside skepticism—without dissolving the doubt. The tile’s dimming and the whale-drawn “silver scars” visibly mark the price paid for staying. Causal linkage holds: each remembered layer arrives because the protagonist keeps touching and transcribing, therefore narrowing his options until remaining is the only honest act.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spatial distortions tighten like a tourniquet around the immortal’s refusal to accept distance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—“I might finally learn how to say goodbye and mean…a direction”—with undeniable conceptual cost (immortality’s grip loosed). Each braid of light/geometry adds density without outline drift; no orientation debt; payoff image re-weights every earlier goodbye denied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: father’s death → cylinder found → ink used → narrator rewrites equation → dawn hand-off. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “mathematics of a fair trade” is redefined on the page, with the narrator’s initials enacting the cost. Orientation is clean by line 4 (“Mercy Street Funeral Home, prep room, tonight”). Persistent constraint—the ink’s liquefaction of certainty—shapes every tactical rereading of the equations.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank-dated index reweights the entire premise, making the silence consultable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each lamp-warble adds density until the final flicker-out crystallizes the archive. Persistent constraint (buzzing lamp as sole companion) shapes every tactical move. Cost is unmistakable: “last line trails into a pale, unfinished ripple” while Aurelio waits for a sound that never comes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is the pencil-written certificate on the back of the poison label—an on-page Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of remaining unfinished legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first “paperwork washed… like rainwater” to the final “port shuffled and sighed,” each sensory layer tightening the stake in erasure. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation is taught by line 3 (“he walked out… anyway”) and pays off when the same bureaucratic void becomes his chosen freedom. Persistent constraint—bureaucracy’s ability to delete lives—shapes every tactic (listening, refusing ink, rewriting death).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “ephemeral compass” is revealed as the living map of her own painful memory; she accepts perpetual questioning and walks back toward the cliff—path foreclosed, cost felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hum thickens the air, reweights the dominant stake (“Can meaning hold without myth?”) until the final image answers “only if you keep walking.” Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no causality gaps. Persistent constraint—unfinished cello keeps generating new memory edits—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: data → graffiti → neighborhood drift → Council suspicion. Closure is a Charged Poise: the serpent mural reframes stay-or-flee with visible stakes, no neat answer. One minor scaffold: “I thought, naively…” explains rather than dramatizes the hubris beat; costs still register in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (iceberg summit, submerged-city lights, pulsar beacon) tightens the same stake—loss of the last untouched grain—until the amber glow reweights it into beauty remembered. Closure is Charged Poise: options (lie, delay, surrender) are crystallized in the final red-vial silence, cost felt. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: “dawning hush” is named more than enacted, but the amber bloom pays the pattern off.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the drone’s departure reconfigures both artisan and machine from broken to attuned under a single audible image—the harbor bell’s Doppler fade. Causal chain holds: cracked spine → re-patch → water-refraction test → trust calibration → launch. No teleporting props or retro-fixes; every screw turned stays turned. Cost is legible in the hush after the buzz slips into fog.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: falcon delivery → forged note → ice crossing → seam revelation; each because/therefore link narrows options until the protagonist commits cartographic heresy. The cylinder sketch and condensation pattern are telegraphed early, paid off when they meet at the bluff seam, forging a single Decisive Change. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5 and never drift. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “quiet trouble it would bring” foreshadows bureaucratic reprisal, making the new line a burning bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of two sets of footsteps synchronizing under the arch reconfigures the town’s possibilities and carries undeniable felt cost—return, exposure, shared risk. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly walks deposit rhythm into the tuning fork, pattern breaks when the wagon arrives, cadence shift charges the ending. Causality is poetic but coherent—each footstep literally stores pressure that the fork converts into bell-resonance, a rule taught early and paid off. Orientation is clean: fog-thinned cobblestones and cracked windows anchor who/where/when within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sensory memory accretion, tightening until the protagonist becomes archive. Closure is Charged Poise—"I felt the lonesome splendor of being remembered by what I remembered"—with undeniable conceptual cost: eternal servitude as mnemonic battery. Orientation anchors within first 60 words; transitions are unnecessary in single-scene drift. No causality breaks; each beat deepens texture and narrows future options. Cost is visible on-page at final image; earlier constraints (no surface, dwindling power) shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower becomes “a throat clogged with tales,” reweighting the prison from stone cage to story engine; cost is the deferred exposure of bodies and the moral complicity he embraces. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of groan-mapping and lattice listening intensifies to discovery of hovering pages; final image reconfigures meaning without requiring causal explosion. Orientation anchored by 120 words (location, twilight arrival, shackles). Persistent constraint—time before corpses surface—shapes tactics and tightens the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: bead-offer → vision → vow tightens options; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—his promise crystallizes enduring servitude with felt cost (“branches bowing in solemn joy”). Orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the widened, net-woven harbor entrance is carved in sandstone, making the conceptual cost—Orren has replaced the town’s forgotten law with his own living myth—undeniable. Causality holds throughout: because the press burned and the plate warped, therefore he grafts its lines onto stone; because he sleepwalks here, therefore the labyrinth “walks through him,” licensing the final image where dream and deed converge. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and the moonlit bay cues persist to the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds density to the orchard/bones/sundial motif until the final solar alignment crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—time restored, continuity felt—yet the cost (permanent exile from straight-line modernity) is only implied, not nailed to the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of alias-candidates tightens until the single name Marin Verge crystallizes meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: envelope poised on slot reweights every prior alias as futures foregone. Cost legible in “apology”-fold and palm-seal heat. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60 (“golden arcade at dawn”).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: missing stars → false charts → prince seeks untraceable route → Liora sews absence-void map that warns him of erasure. The empty palace loop in the cloth is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—ghost path chosen. Orientation anchored by frost prints and candle by line 6; no ambiguity. Closure beat lands with visible constraint: “those who walk there vanish completely.”

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “I was afraid” reweights every prior condensation-letter and the client’s unsent stack, forcing a before/after on the living. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of song, mist, and shard pulses tightens until the final pane crystallizes the stalled apology. Causality is intact: the shard’s salt-vein hunger literally summons the spirits and pays off in the brother’s surfaced motive. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 40 words and the taught disorientation (labyrinth rules) resolves into the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the swinging doors sever Mara from the boy while the coral’s weight in her pocket reweights her role from medium to bearer of unrecoverable past. Causal linkage holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore: coral in leg → consent dilemma → translation of cast → lie → acceptance of complicity. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“mist-clad atrium”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s blurred reflection in the glass literalizes her newly complicit identity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wall becomes “exposed film developing,” reweighting the premise—light murals can repossess public joy without ownership—at undeniable conceptual cost (power dies, image vanishes). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of color/fog images tightens toward the charged poise final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One reflective block obeys BRR. Eligible for 9+ but final sentence is slightly cushioned; cost is felt but not given a sharper physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via echo-pattern (“between question and reply”) and held to the final Charged Poise: the hush after the wall’s exhalation reweights knowledge itself. Closure is the conceptual repricing of “certainty” into “curiosity,” cost felt in the narrator’s abandonment of professional protocol. Persistent constraint: the nickel stays warm, the garden keeps exhaling questions—tactics shift from restoration to co-creation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 8; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city sleeps above a subterranean sentence whose political cost is felt in the Ministry’s future audits. Causal chain holds—each forged permit leads to gourd-seed grammar—though the final beat is collective, not personal. One tightening beat where Arlen’s forged signature almost fails would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon’s return is negotiated through sung words, coral blooms, and the postcard image, all paying visible cost in public exposure and concession to imperfection. Causal chain is lyric but legible: song → coral path → revealed moon → poet’s acceptance; no beat is reversible without breaking the spell. Orientation is swift; “gargantuan shell” anchors place by line 3. Minor slack: the postcard’s “instructions” are declarative backstory, yet they tilt the present choice and are paid off when the card is lifted to sky.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final breath re-prices the entire archive. Orientation is taught by translucent shelves and footstep memory within 50 words; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orphan song is not catalogued but adopted, making the caretaker’s neutrality extinct. Cost is the fresh orchid glowing then dimming—irreversible contamination of curated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the completed vow physically alters breath and speech, a Decisive Change with visible cost (“snag and tear”). Causal lens holds: because he inks the lattice, therefore he leaves the archive irreversibly bound to honesty. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—final sentence commits him to the dusk meeting—satisfies escalation requirement. No loops or causal amnesia; vellum, ink, and body track throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the chain-circle reconfiguration is on-page and carries conceptual cost—the city accepts rotating vulnerability. Causality is Accumulative: chain → proposal → stepped acceptance; no single reversal, but density tightens. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The invitation-via-saliva trick is elided until late, but the pattern is taught in time to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust motes, pigeon routes, and meteorite build density until the final song-tying reweights meaning with undeniable cost. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bird carries both the song and the proof that trust can survive its own ruins. Orientation is swift—attic, dawn, rain-smell within 60 words. No causal contradictions; every beat adds texture that the final image retroactively charges.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the daughter freezes before the “necessary step,” world balance legibly hanging. Causal chain: decoding logbook → terrace jolt → entry to maze → confrontation → renunciation; each because/therefore link advances knowledge and narrows options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“town floated on a drifting prism terrace”) and pays off in the final aerial tableau—waiver applies. Cost is on-page: perpetual exile for the father, lifelong sentinel distance for the daughter. No lens ambiguity; the persistent constraint (one uncrossable strip) shapes both tactics and final image, meeting 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome adopts “a breathing rhythm” that reweights belonging from chart to listening, with the felt cost of surrendering surface certainty (the feather’s uselessness). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light failure adds density until the bioluminescent shrimp pattern-break reconfigures attention. Causality is coherent—because lights fail, narrator experiments; therefore volunteers drift, fish veer, and new lighting tides are installed. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and never waver.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative lens holds: each seed-tunnel beat deepens texture and reweights the stake from “solve disappearance” to “witness deferral.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—unfinished crystal meaning “postponed, not stolen”—with visible cost: Lio’s ledger now carries blank pages he must guard until the world finishes deciding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop’s diagonal cut reconfigures the crowd’s perceived options with undeniable conceptual cost (“new moves became visible”). Causal chain—tide timetable → coin choices → bishop plant—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One persistent constraint (tide’s return) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is immaculate: Mareh bites the moon-speck, trades a private memory for a public constellation—an irreversible Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole world. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyric shard adds density until the final droplet sinks and the garden’s mirror reconfigures. Orientation is swift—lagoon, garden, night, outlaw name all within 120 words; no penalty. One hairline slip: the “obsidian grace” phrase recycles three times, a micro-loop that dulls the final cadence by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the request for one more dawn reframes the entire atrium as the town’s “reflection problem,” foreclosing demolition without preaching. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added shard of memory tightens the stakes until the final image of light “walking” the glass reweights everything. Cost is unmistakable: the glazier stakes his professional credibility on a poetics the council may ignore.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Rafe’s telling reframes twenty years of silence and gifts Maya a new map of failure, cost felt in “words scraped on the way out.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—image & object density tighten the stake until the moonlit ridge reweights guilt into shared burden. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Porcelain box is kept-object whose state tracks causally from shard → glued → carried → offered. One shard transition (past-to-present) taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each physical rearrangement of decorations → gauge needle → visible futures, culminating in a Charged Poise that reweights kindness as survivable. Closure lands on-page (“this is enough to begin”) with conceptual cost—no smashing, no retreat, only modest ascent accepted. One hairline slip: the “parallel timelines” framing is asserted rather than dramatized, but the pattern is taught early and repaid in the triple-reflection image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sonic layer thickens until the diaries and film reweight the stake from mere survey to custodianship. The “conscious node” moment is a Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly forecloses walking away. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. Closure carries conceptual cost: the corridor exhales, relieved, and the narrator accepts perpetual servitude. Persistent constraint—the film canister now in pocket—shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative-textural lens taught early; lyric shards layer visions until the girl’s arrival tightens to a direct plea; closure is a resonant reconfiguration—mirrors briefly re-priced, payment acknowledged—delivered with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signed page reweights the premise—peace is not justice but “interruption of killing”—and the cost is legible in the negotiator’s self-disgust. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ritual element (salt, ash, water) intensifies the density of remembered loss, crystallizing in the final moon-lit signature. Causality is intact because the envoy’s earlier arithmetic of knots makes his eventual concession inevitable. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient terrace at midsummer”) and never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mosaic track earned: four aerial-to-ground shards, pattern taught by word 150, transitions legible via helicopter→boots→basin. Causal lens holds: because I starved the river, therefore the flats cracked into a map, therefore I can place the egg. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s release reweights the entire water-theft premise under the “echo” rule-set; cost is felt in the chest-ache and ludicrous fragility of the offering. Orientation anchored by word 50—no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed hush reweights the palace’s rule-set—courtiers forget how to stand—while the price (Iri’s body now a conduit for every disallowed feeling) is unmistakable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-layer thickens the ambient pressure until the single exhalation detonates etiquette itself. Orientation is taught early by the snow-muted courtyard and the shimmer rising from the well; later payoff waives any debt. Causality is lyric-notated but intact—because she knits the echoes rather than bottling them, the lullaby fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens (lyric-accumulative) is taught early and held: the campfire stick’s weight gathers across beats until the closing “orbit.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—stories choose to orbit rather than escape—reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Orientation is clean; radar dome anchors who/where within 60 words. Slight causal slippage: puppet-show backstory is summarized, not shown, so the ethical pivot leans on exposition, but it doesn’t break the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each braided grass spire adds material density that reweights the stake—“can architecture become a hand?” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monarch drinks, the grotto drifts on, and the cost is felt in the image of fading orange against spinning moth-wing. Anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3 and are re-anchored each shard; no orientation debt. One micro-turn: the wind’s cadence shifts from threat to invitation once the signal towers align—enough tightening for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: because the caster’s cracked bell never rang, therefore he follows the punched scrap north; because he can re-braid precisely, therefore the rope sings and re-casts his guilt into audible names. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the rope’s hum reweights his lifelong premise from bronze to sound, with the persistent constraint that every future casting must now ring. Orientation is clean by line 4; no prop or knowledge teleporting; the single transition (surface → sanctum) is motivated by letter silence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the bunker’s command glitches into fragments while the protagonist’s hand closes on the wafer, reconfiguring survival into self-authored motion. Causality is tight—every dream artifact and sensor alert tightens the either/or—so the final image of “he steps into the present” carries undeniable conceptual cost: eternal exile from the only shelter. Lens is causal throughout: because the dreams invite, therefore the directive frays, therefore he refuses the seal. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (concrete floor, roots on roof) are fixed by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of repeated alignment attempts tightens stakes via density, not causal chains. Closure is Charged Poise—final cloud-reveal reweights prior notebook smudge with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“dusk…palace”). No teleporting props; tile warmth is subjective perception, not break. Cost legible in final sentence: “richer by a question he could never exhaust.”

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silent box produces a felt note inside the chest, reweighting the premise that silence can heal. Causal chain holds: broken box → memory surfacing → bodily realization → release of resentment. One minor warp: the sanctuary’s rules are taught only through metaphor, so the “reality shift” beat feels slightly author-staged rather than character-driven. Still, the final image is inseparable from the cause that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density and cadence shift reweight the stake from “trap a dream” to “become its vessel.” Orientation is anchored by word 30; fog’s breathing taught as pattern; closure lands in Charged Poise—“the district flared like suns on glass mountains” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality internal to lyric mode holds: each silver-dust trace thickens the mirror until identity liquidity is the price. No plot amnesia; sextant crack and dream-escape stay consistently operative.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens: each image (contract ashes, feral orchard, ribbon rain) layers density until the closing “slow rain of petals” reweights stakes from legal title to seasonal caretaking. The orientation anchor—“by the time the apples ripened in the rafters”—arrives inside the first line, satisfying the ~120-word rule. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the deciduous vow forecloses repossession and crystallizes a charged poise with conceptual cost—he accepts perpetual uncertainty. One causality hiccup: the bag contents (lens, wire, lead) appear as a late inventory rather than seeded tools, but they don’t break the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s crossing reweights inheritance rules and imposes sideways accountability. Causal linkage holds: annotation-cluster pressure → glowing shell → mirror fruit → step through; each beat narrows option toward acceptance. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“lonely asteroid”), well inside safe window. One shard only, no transition; length fits 600–800 default; cost legible in the final image of carrying future-fruit and bathroom memory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the traveler scatters the archive, Lysa maps the absences; because she offers repair labor, the clerk grants conditional entry; because she writes in the margin rather than the center, the rescue mission is re-scripted without erasing regret. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the book’s page re-veins itself, making the price of her refusal irreversible yet generative. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; no debt. One transition—desk to spiral descent—is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (carousel mirrors, ticket-stub curtain) thickens the stake until the theater-garden reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“I stayed, a blissfully aberrant shadow”—reweighting the premise that classification was inevitable. Time is anchored by sensory cues within 120 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the emerald card burn lingers and shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is tight: rumor-door → seal → note in her hand → re-braiding → clock correction, each because/therefore step legible. The thirteenth chime supplies a decisive micro-turn that converts discovery into irreversible action; the price—an un-sealed war of absences now permanently recorded—lands as conceptual cost. Closure obeys the Accumulative lens: pattern of gaps thickens until the final image reweights memory itself. The only waiver is mild orientation flirtation—door materializes without early rule cue—but the 120-word anchor is met and the payoff justifies the delay.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the conjured hush cups the storm-sound, a Charged Poise that reweights the premise—lightning must learn rest. Causal chain holds: fracture-reading → gap finding → stone activation → bloom; each step narrows options toward irrevocable quiet. Cost is conceptual yet legible—the mapkeeper internalizes the storm’s volume and cancels it with his own stillness—so lens and price survive the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard cracks and reweights the entire premise—silence was never void but repository. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the comet’s uncharted ellipse snaps the lattice and releases the voice. Cost is the shard itself, the custodian’s youth, the decade of unsent pleas—made legible in the single beam. Orientation is taught early (“after the collapse,” “eleventh year”) and pays off when the comet arrives exactly on schedule of exhausted oil.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city will wake “certain of things it did not know it had almost forgotten,” a conceptual repricing with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of crystals ⇄ parchments ⇄ monuments reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint—shadow shortening—shapes final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flaming palm reconfigures the starless night from abyss to cradle, a visible cost paid in spent shells and singed air. Causality holds: each shell placement, the rag-knot graft, and the final fuse-light form a because-therefore chain that narrows options to this single sky-message. The Orientation Test is waived—initial disorientation (no stars, unnamed fortress) is taught early and pays off when the sky becomes readable. Persistent constraint: the absent spinner’s rag knot, once appropriated, becomes the burning seed that shapes the palm’s heart.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision seeps in like groundwater, reconfiguring both futures with felt cost—the sea life he must now seasonally forfeit. Lens holds Accumulative: each tide-mark image layers density until the final line crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“grotto”), well within waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final shared weightlessness re-channels the bunker-builder’s lifetime of defensive concrete into a mutual vocabulary of silences, with the cost legible in the father’s unbolted shoulders and the child’s relinquished doll. Causality holds: inversion hour → doll lost → silence shared → stance crystallized. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“xenial trellis above the clouds”) and time marks arrive with each inversion alarm. The piece follows a single-scene arc compressed into two gravity-flip shards, taught early and paid off in the final image, satisfying Track B mosaic criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of “a bridge made of gentled breaths” reweights the premise—silence becomes communal shelter. Causality holds: storm-glass permission → switch off speakers → visible blue line → passenger stillness → crystallized hush. One minor slack: the vial’s crystals merely “attentive,” never spike, so the weather stake evaporates. Cost is conceptual (foreclosed noise, shared vulnerability) rather than personal, acceptable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as conceptual repricing: by embedding the ruby he dissolves the throne, re-weighting humanity’s right to imperfect memory; countdown constellations provide persistent constraint, cost on-page. Causal linkage holds—because he peels murals he finds ruby, therefore he can sabotage the throne—lens stays causal without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last line reweights every prior bridge-burning into a new bridge igniting “in a different direction,” fulfilling the fading-threshold concept. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each exit has deposited breathable air in the sanctuary until Mara can finally inhale it. Causality is intact: the doorknocker’s warmth, the starlit dust, the scar map all pay off in the final breath. Felt cost is inescapable—“every shore behind her was blackened.”</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s roofless charcoal bowl and starlit dust are not backdrop but breathable medium—“the air… drag through her lungs like a river changing direction.” Spatial choreography is clean: single path, benches, center circle, all constrain movement toward the keeper. The eye-shaped doorknocker reappears as tactile warmth, anchoring threshold logic. Without this specific hollow, the final inhale would lose its environmental viscerality.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—will Mara ever let herself be seen?—tightens when the keeper reveals she has been arriving here all along. Agency stays hers: she lifts the ring, offers her palm, chooses to inhale. One meaningful deepening—shared scars as memory archive—narrows escape options to a single breath. Cost is palpable: the blackened shores cannot be uncooked.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: hatch wheel turns, bolt syncs, options re-weighted—stay below or ascend into unknown risk—cost is the audible sigh of a sealed past opening. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: fungal glow, drip echoes, glitch-text density tighten until the hatch sigh releases pressure. Causality holds: stalled pumps → regret storm → message → bolt tug → wheel turn, each because/therefore legible. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“beneath the drowned city”) so no penalty; transitions (phone black → carved wet font) are taught pattern, paid off at hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) arrives the instant the needle hovers above bare metal and the queen’s ring-thud reweights Aurel’s identity; the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, the sepia room itself the record. Orientation locks within ~120 words via “sepia reading room,” “first yawn of evening,” and named city heat. Cost is legible in the standing-wave image that forever replays his complicity—no shot fired, but sound never dies. Persistent constraint: the gramophone’s hum now lives in his marrow.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “future had just unsnapped its strings” reweights every prior puppet motif with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: program handed → mask seen → renunciation declared; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation anchored by line 3 (midnight, frost-breathing greenhouse). Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“dust helped her… mapping neglect”) and holds: each box’s dust-thickness becomes the pattern that guides her search, culminating in the charged poise of walking the aisles “feeling the pulse.” Orientation is clear by word 60; closure reweights the premise—files become “lives that might yet be recalled”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal turn is required under this lens; the pattern break suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: key → lagoon → booth → archive → coded strip; each step narrows options with visible cost (silence, exhaustion, possession of contraband code). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lio steps back carrying the strip whose distribution will foreclose anonymity—cost is felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly via Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy unhooks from the future not by louder playing but by deliberate omission—negative space as silencing tool. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through daily ritual and sensory pattern until the final cadence unravels the tune. Orientation is complete by line 5; transition between city memory and present grotto is legible and signaled by the patched case. Cost is unmistakable: the heavier fog, bruised prisms, and the “eerie nostalgia for a disaster that might now refuse to happen.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: planting the questions re-weights the entire arbor/valley rule-set and the moonstone-bearing leaf makes the cost undeniable. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of leaves, seeds, monuments accumulates until the cadence shift at “the valley felt a new story beginning.” Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3, no disorientation. One minor softening: the voice’s invitation (“Will you plant them”) is the first external prompt Lio obeys, so the decisive act is partly bestowed rather than wholly self-generated; still, the prior refusal to plant is clearly motivated, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Eli does not decide to “fix” uncertainty but redesigns his tools to accommodate it. The compass-rose’s pivot from Perhaps → Now → Begin supplies the tightening beat that reweights the entire story. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each image (waterfall, greenhouse, clock-stems) intensifies the stake of improvising time itself. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—hands that hesitate forever foreclose the old commerce of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the thirteenth constellation—“two footprints facing opposite horizons”—legibly reweights what “Wanderer” means, with the coin’s crack as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain-to-mirror, rust-to-ink, coin-to-constellation form a density chain that peaks in the luminous final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“old foundry”), well under the 120-word allowance. No lens ambiguity; every metaphor tightens the same seam between naming and fate.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s music modulates from wail to giggle, re-weighting the living/dead contract. Causal chain holds—each confession is elicited by Mara’s teasing invitation, tightening strings toward harmony. Cost is legible in the final image: sunrise fully enters the gorge, innocence returned to children, but Mara’s private ache (tooth bite, crown of wind) persists. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap descends and pain “begins to factor,” a legible before/after with cost. Causal logic holds—each remembered injury motivates the walk toward the frame—though the forest-as-interface rule is taught late; the orientation waiver applies because disorientation pays off in the reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of images builds until the lighthouse shard drops as a pattern-break that re-weights the stake. Causality stays internal—each canvas detail is a because/therefore of attention, not plot—but the final image of closed fist + city lights below delivers a Charged Poise with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is taught lyrically from line 1 (“silver spine”) and waived when the payoff arrives; no ambiguity at closure. The missing live option-foreclosure keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the ceiling treaty ruptures, the living world is now literally porous, and the narrator’s hand on the barrel is the irreversible signature. Causality under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every detail (dust ring, pulsing bulge, fluorescent death) accretes until the membrane tears. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The price is felt—“silence settled, thick and specific”—yet the narrator’s personal stake beyond professional curiosity could be sharper, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the printed page rewrites causality treaties, re-weighting reality’s rule-set while Ilen smiles “without triumph,” cost felt in the librarians’ stretched voices and the shelving-by-feeling decree. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each printed page destabilizes systems, frost patterns accumulate toward the spiral sentence, and the final luminous page compresses all library days into one shared moment, tightening cadence rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught early (“The glass orchard library floated…”) and anchors remain stable; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the asteroid re-imagined as theatre of unused futures; the cost is the leak of those futures when storm curtains rise, a price felt in “burnished sorrow” that reweights the entire premise. Causal lattice holds: shard → dispute → veiled mirrors → new reflection, each because/therefore step narrowing possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: dishonest rust → shard fracture → Elias offers truthful song → covenant rewired → light restored. The resonance chamber reveals the stakes at the ⅔ mark, tightening options to “sing or stay dark.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city breathes, the box stays warm—felt cost visible in Elias’s emptied lungs and the Mayor’s lantern newly honest. One scaffold loop (“the rust… the rust…”) nicks clarity but does not break the image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: compass burn → vision → follow → boat → lagoon crossing, each step a therefore-link narrowing escape. Closure is Charged Poise: the spinning needle locking inward makes the hinge-legible cost undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One causal micro-gap—why the factory “guards” is inferred not dramatized—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch becomes map-center, engine hum turns mantra, cost felt in “no blue line to follow.” Causal chain holds: dead GPS → stop → find slide → see self → reorient life. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by line 5; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ira’s sketches re-route the cathedral’s hidden optics into public walls, a conceptual repricing that costs him exclusive knowledge and charges the final “umbral tenderness.” Causal chain holds—postcard → Liora → gallery climb → etched-glass epiphany → artistic dissemination—each step narrows his options from private knowledge to shared witness. Orientation is clean by line 10; no lens ambiguity. The only minor drag is a single paraphrase loop (“dawning hush” repeated with identical weight), not enough to breach the 9+ gate but enough to hold the score at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the diary’s added weight and the shoreline’s dark invitation reconfigure Maris’s archival ethic with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of lagoon, debris-letters, and diary pulses intensify density until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early (zeppelin, dusk, satchel) and pays off when the same shoreline rewrites her constellations. One minor scaffold—”Tonight began after the letters are found” could be compressed—does not touch the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bottle warms only when the alchemist’s reimagined town pattern seals against despair, making the cost conceptual yet undeniable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—lantern reflections, salt, bottle hexagons accumulate until pattern crystallizes; no causal turns required. Orientation is taught by second sentence; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Lan realizes the wax archives an earlier scribe imposing the same emotional weather he now enforces, looping oath into prophecy. Causal chain holds—because the wax survives, therefore Lan’s method exists, therefore he must perpetuate the pattern—visible cost is the foreclosure of escape (“he would speak an accidental prophecy”). Single-scene orientation is secured by the fifth sentence; no penalty. Lens is Causal; linkage intact, no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s warmth implants alien memories, visibly foreclosing the narrator’s prior life. Causal linkage is clean—Myra’s invitation → tactile test → whispered bargain → memory graft. The vortex rule-set is taught early (“redistribute… lose what others gain”) and charges the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“I was seventeen…”) and the glass ribs map spatially; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias steps back, the rope unused, the valley still bright, but the zero-hour clause is now a live wound in the story’s rule-set. Causal lens holds throughout—every instrument twitch and wind shift tightens the because/therefore chain toward this single refusal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. The cost is legible in the final image: “the slow, steady beating of his own uncertain heart” – uncertainty itself becomes the concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure: Charged Poise—he reconfigures identity from cleaner to witness, broom becomes staff, cost is lifelong exposure. Accumulative lens: stillness/density build to final image. Lantern glass causally triggers every monitor flicker; no prop teleport. Orientation anchored by line 3. No meaningful escalation flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dawn vigil layers silence until the stained light finally reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism on Mara’s chest makes the cost of guardianship legible without solving it. Persistent constraint—the covenant grooves rising like welts—shapes the keeper’s tactics throughout. One transition (yard → shed) is clean; orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the townsfolk’s collective hush re-weights the premise from “guarding leaked time” to “learning to float inside it,” and the cost is the narrator’s loss of explanatory certainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure mounts via image-density rather than causal reversals—and the final image of “anticipated mysteries” crystallizes options without dissolving them. Orientation is taught early by the glowing silo and the “cracked driveway” anchor; no caps triggered. One hairline slip: the phrase “I did not know what would happen” briefly spells out the ambiguity the image already conveys, a minor softening that keeps the score just shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the feather’s cooled pulse and the audible shift in lagoon dissonance reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost—“harmony is not the same as completion.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening→harmonizing→seeing woven dawns→visitation. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. One minor causality gap: the being’s exit doesn’t tighten options further, so the poise feels slightly open-ended rather than constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is lyric but legible: diagnosis → diary retitle → copper synapses → stone answers → death midwifing a new pact. Each beat tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens until the orchard’s collective hum reconfigures meaning more surely than any single act. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the living mountain now literally “speaks” through wired roots, and the caretaker’s last heartbeat is the felt price. Orientation is swift; tension escalates by density, not reversal; no artifact blunts the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral clearing reconfigures the pilgrimage from mandatory ritual to open question, cost legible in “rain steaming from my coat, fly amber cool in my hand.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each descriptive layer (moss, footprints, bronze quiet) thickens the stake of belonging until the bare earth offers no answer—an earned stasis. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by second paragraph. The only hairline slip is a single adverb cluster (“almost polished, yet up close moss…”) that mildly dilutes immediacy, but it neither breaks escalation nor touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final brown pod, smelling of rain-on-ash, reweights the entire battlefield into a covert garden-to-be; the reef’s absence is accepted as non-reversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each seed placement thickens historical strata until the pier becomes a palimpsest. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“gloom-hill coachman”) and spatial track never slips. Cost is unmissable: “her instruction still glowed like a coal in his chest” and the whistle relinquishes human futurity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to share the cylinder reweights guilt into communal witness, cost felt in the thickening hush. Causal chain holds: stranger arrives → cylinder played → revelation heard → choice to keep it circulating. Orientation anchors within 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via layered voices and color-grooves; no contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: palm pressed to cold glass, Elian crystallizes a private north out of bent starlight, reconfiguring “true north” from fixed point to chosen bearing. Causality holds: every dilation artifact seeds the final stance; the sketchbook his mother inked for “nights you cannot find home” allows him to remap homelessness as freedom. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory recurrence (dusty air, lagging star-sway) until meaning tilts. Persistent constraint: the offline generator scar keeps time fractionally wrong, charging the final image with irreversible occupational risk.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “let the wrong sky write me anew” reweights the premise with undeniable social/mythic cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each chess-trade beat escalates the stakes until the king-offering triggers the on-page reconfiguration. Orientation is taught early (“night the sky went wrong”) and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the gallery will keep whispering stories the narrator has walked into it, a conceptual repricing that makes the city’s leaderless state and the narrator’s pawn-renunciation irreversible. Causality is accumulative/image-driven rather than event-linear; each circuit of foot-walked text tightens the stake of what can be archived before power returns. The cost is legible in the final line: the building’s future silence will be filled only with routes of words his feet can no longer add. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and pay off in the dome’s final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “hidden thunder” reweights the premise—home is not a place but a mouth forced open by language. Cost is felt in the pain behind ribs and the audible cracking of “sealed rooms.” Causal linkage holds: the stone’s demand → protagonist speaks → thunder inside bones. No orientation debt; mountain, niche, and map are anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each thread-tug because/therefore advances the staircase or darkens the tapestry, tightening options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—time restarts not by triumph but by Elior’s acceptance of unerasable guilt; the toll is the pawn’s crown now irreversibly worn. Orientation is taught early via suspended raindrops and mid-breath mayor; disorientation pays off when the bell trembles and drops fall. No causality breaks, no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each poetic refraction changes Maren’s options until the only path left is the spire with her multiplied truths. Closure is a Charged Poise—she descents carrying “prismatic, aching knowledge,” a conceptual cost that reweights forgiveness itself. The spire’s earlier stakes (strip-versus-whole) cleanly foreclose in a single image. Minor deduct for slight over-exposition in Zev’s warning speech; otherwise causality is airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fracture becomes a bright seam, reweighting the rule-set—destruction is now a medium for meaning. Cost is legible in the cracked cylinder, shredded voice, and the line “offered no guarantee that he himself would survive.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: corrosion pattern → auric lattice → glass seam accumulates density until the final cadence shift (“page mid-sentence”). Orientation anchored by 120 words (workshop, acid sea, vats, grated floor). No teleporting props; charm socket is set up early.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern-painting crystallizes his promise into an object, and the unmixed water holds the conceptual cost—proof that a hidden vow can be kept only by surrendering the illusion of timelessness. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard of mirror, stalagmite, and painted shell layers density until the final shaft of moonlight reweights every prior image. Causality holds because every beat of the walk narrows physical options (sea → rocks → cave → pool) and none are reversed; the “wrong turn” is a motivated ellipsis, not coincidence. The price is on-page: the pool “agreeing to keep the secret” shows the painter has traded his nostalgia for stewardship of an unrepeatable moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-density and light-pattern accumulate until the beam reconfigures from “harsh white spear” to “softer cobalt wash.” The single tightening is the scent-triggered lens-glow, which reweights the stake and lands with conceptual cost—the sea’s forgiveness is now socially legible to the boats. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options foreclose for Jorah’s noise philosophy while Mara's tactic is ratified. No orientation debt; causality clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as earned renunciation: Rian charts a road that no longer exists, paying the cost of deliberate false cartography. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake of “reverse migration.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by ~80 words inside the failing station. Persistent constraint—dead hydraulics, analog console, single landline—shapes every tactic; cost is legible in the final image of trembling maps under an almost-full moon.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass eye’s shift from ominous relic to “plain surface” reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the final sentence—“we practiced seeing one another and surviving the sight”—a Charged Poise that forecloses the old terror. Causality holds: the truffle-mapping, truth-telling, and storm converge to precipitate the clearing. One minor loop—”discredited textbooks” reiterated three times in 60 words—nicks perfection but does not touch the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the investigator’s assumption of the edelweish re-weights the premise—witnessed isolation is now inherited duty—at exact visible cost (pinning the flower and waiting). Causality is lyric-accumulative; each reported “absence” tightens the conceptual trap so the final image crystallizes options rather than explains them. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the 25 % mark and holds through the last line. No orientation debt, no causal gaps, no loop artifacts touching the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone softens “with a sound like paper turning,” Elias crosses, and every prior map becomes rehearsal—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: receipt → chip → coordinates → cavern → chip-as-key, each beat tightening options. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Only the sister’s off-page vanishing keeps it from perfect inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: dream → seventh warning → iron taste → climb → grotto revelation; each beat narrows options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—starlight wounds reframe her reign—visible cost is the forsaken treaty and the sky’s bleeding future now tethered to her skin. Orientation is clean by line 4; lens stays Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shell will carry the nexus heat outward, re-weighting “returning differently” with social cost (exile, guild censure) legible in the donated ampoule light. Causal lens holds: because the friends are leaving, therefore Lio must transpose place into object, narrowing his future. Orientation anchors by line 4; no debt. One transition (memory shard) taught early and repaid at end. Cost is felt, not merely declared—pocket sun literally handed over.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the premise of self-haunting until the final image reweights time as "pack of stray dogs." Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"I am here alone…still cannot look away"—but the middle ellipsis between cabin and flight is a mild causality gap; a smoother transition would tighten linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the screw becomes a “point of quiet gravity” that re-weights every future drop—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds: fog → drip → screw glisten pattern taught by 25 % and tightened once. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives within 60 words; no penalty. “Nothing changed, and yet everything changed” is the precise beat where causality and texture converge; price is the client’s blurred vision and Mara’s forfeited illusion of neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the platform descends while Lan cradles the cup-inkwell, his luminous scars now story-margins, cost felt in “waiting tempests.” Causal linkage holds—each rune is birthed from a dramatized memory under master’s rule that superstition husks must be shed. No orientation debt; anchoring (who/where) delivered by sentence 3. One lens throughout: Causal, focused because/therefore of memory → rune → visible light scar.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook CR: the column’s transmission re-weights the entire premise—public confession as imperfect miracle—felt on line “a small electric offering.” Causal lens holds: each surge is because/therefore feedback. Orienting props (conservatory, duffel, reel-to-reel) appear by 70 words; spatial debt is waived because disorientation charges the final glow. No plot amnesia; perfume and sheet-music are tracked to the last spark.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the braided single history is not claimed but quietly shown when the hush “pealed outward,” reweighting the premise that remembrance must be exclusive. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative) rather than strictly causal; the spiral walk accumulates density until the dictionary’s placement knots all strands. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation—temple corridors that “fold back on themselves”—and this pays off when the same geometry becomes the arbitration ritual, so no penalty applies. Cost is legible in the instant No-One loses plural pasts: the universe exhales one breath, he stands inside it, and the reader feels the narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the key abandoned on the parapet reconfigures his pact with time and reweights every prior drip of the station. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and the final image’s conceptual cost (“unwinding sea”) satisfies the lens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: fjord, pre-dawn, cliff-edge station. One minor creak: the horizon-as-instrument metaphor is floated early but only re-activated at the end; still, the resonance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reinforced plastic sheet—mapped earlier as impermeable—becomes permeable in the final image, re-pricing every prior security metaphor. The because/therefore chain is tight: spatial compulsion → repeated perimeter checks → mirror-moment with stranger → override → irreversible model change. Cost is visible in the shared hesitation and the quiet loss of the old intrusion-detection self. Drive lens (Causal) holds without wobble; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the daughter’s handwritten reversal (“we stay anyway because staying changes them”) reweights both stakes and the father’s smile of loss-into-richer—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mosaic structure (library → subway → hospital) is taught by 25% and coheres; transitions are legible via rain motif and mirrored note handling. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the inherited gamble-language now applies to cardiac odds, shaping tactics inside the hospital room.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara rewrites her loop by dialing her sister; Lena’s price is renewed exile. Causal chain holds—glass tone → instruction → streetlamp fade → new dial—with no soft resets. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; the single-scene default is met. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through lyrical density until the final cadence reweights the stake of endless loops.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger now “heavy enough,” the covenant regenerated, the cost the solitude after Mara fades. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer steeping the paper tightens the stake until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: footprints exit the page, forcing the narrator to the jetty’s edge. Could use one more causal linkage between photo-steeping and Mara’s appearance to breach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kenji’s loneliness is re-priced from private pathology to shared cargo under the reciprocity rule. The final image—“heavier with every truth, until the loneliness shifted from singular to shared”—is on-page and carries conceptual cost (he can never return to the old solitude). Causal lens holds: each confession is a because/therefore step that narrows his exit until he endures the new communal weight. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and continuously reinforced.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern-of-rests melody reweights every prior voice-chord; cost is legible in the ring’s added heaviness and the silent clearing. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held without waver; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening—forest hum → single note trail → absolute silence—reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cosmos exhales, causality flexes without breaking—cost felt in altered star position and softened guilt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “curves” thickens until final gentle unbend. Orientation anchors by line 3; no penalty. Pen’s glow and dust-tracks are taught early; final image reweights all prior revisions.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each signed silence thickens the fabric of “unwritten music” until the final chord resolves. Closure is a Charged Poise—camera click = conceptual reweighting of emptiness as instrument—cost is the audible laugh that harmonizes with harbor silence. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The advisor’s unexplained ontology is tolerable under lyric mode, but his zero causal footprint keeps the beat just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the recovered promise reweights every defaced object with “ferocious care,” cost legible in the suspended tapestry image; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds; orientation anchors by line 5 and the rockslide gateway is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open sky where lagoon was crystallizes new collective agency with undeniable cost—population-scale strings cut. Causal chain intact: drumming → mirrored pulses → others’ tide of attention → shared dream pressed outward. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; pattern of entanglement taught early and reweighted at end. Orientation anchored by word 80; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: geomagnetic storm → nav-failure → inspectors lost → Milo activates pre-oiled vents + key → whispered micro-directions → rescue exactly on deadline. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ramos’s slower walk reconfigures power without a word, proving the whisper thesis with conceptual cost—Milo’s secret method is now exposed to institutional notice. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shutters stay open, the dock keeps its cobalt gleam, and the guardian walks on—earned stasis with visible cost (constellations fade). Causality holds: mirror-beam → water-stars → shutter code → phone call, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation is anchored early (“cobalt dock after rain”), no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-weaving tightens emotional stakes rather than external options; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the council balcony glimpse of the “vast forest” of windows re-weights the town’s perceived options, and two anonymous votes flip—cost is felt in the hush that follows. Causal chain holds: leaf-crade → map-as-chessboard → window-campaign → vote shift; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who=coach, where=school→library, when=after buses leave). One minor scaffold: “unspoken words” motif is stated more than demonstrated in early beats, but pattern pays off at climax and lens (Situational/Accumulative hybrid) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the island’s reappearance is withheld, yet the harbor’s held breath inside Mara reweights her future options with felt cost. Causal linkage holds under Hybrid lens; the scrimshaw’s transfer and instruction sequence drives the final image without teleporting information.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wooden figure crystallizes a clandestine new silence inside the surveillance grid—conceptual cost legible in “remade hush.” Causality holds: spoon-as-rebellion seeds the aesthetic, whittling enacts it, bouquet receives the contraband. Orientation anchors by line 4; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of tactile objects (shavings, tea, pine) reweights the stake rather than because/therefore turns. One soft spot: Mara's absence of choice weakens the two-sided Before/After legibility.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadows sliding across cracked yard, and the chipped mug form a micro-setting triad that constrains mood and stealth. Wooden figure's hollow center recharges the same visual grammar as the bouquet, letting setting evolve into prop. Surveillance sensors under blades appear late but pay off by reframing the room as panopticon, so environment directly shapes the performer’s tactic of “narrative texture” camouflage. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile wood curls and cooling ceramic over visual vista—economy achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lio refuses the assigned poem and exits the dais, crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the audible hush he steps into—approval forfeited, but voice reclaimed. Causal chain intact: because the colonnade answers his whisper, therefore he dares abandonment of the script. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“town finally unlocks…”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive holds—each footstep adds tonal density until the final chord reweights freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new pot, reed, and ash fleck thickens the symbolic density until the final canvas crystallizes. Closure is the Charged Poise of the silent reed + blooming conspirator-plant; cost is the stranger’s transferred insomnia and Mira’s stained hands. Spatial choreography is clean; orientation anchored by line 3. No telegraphing of rules; the plant-alphabet is shown before it is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pilgrimage rule-set is repriced from “guide the stranger” to “be guided by what they hear,” with the cost being Elya’s relinquished authority. Causality is accumulative/textural—color-bends and bell-harmonics build density until the visitor’s need reframes the ritual. The lens is taught early (color → memory → belief) and holds without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by line 8; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Riv offers the impossible loom, therefore Ela accepts; because she plants each bird, the dome reconfigures light and self. The meteor shower ignition is the decisive change that makes her “ruins glow,” paying an undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no teleporting props. Closure lands in the final sketch—it forecloses disappearance and re-opens bloom with felt opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: crash → analog whispers → tape-map → confide → joint laying of cards that reconfigures their future options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared axis “quietly began to form,” crystallizing lateral culture with felt opportunity cost—the city still dies outside. Orientation anchored by word 80, lens taught by 25% and held. Persistent constraint—their map is literally on the floor—shapes tactics; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the realization that “memory itself became unbearable” reweights civilization’s fate and Hiran’s vow to carry patterns alone carries visible cost. Causal lens holds: each clockwise door-opening tightens knowledge and escalates risk, culminating in the focused beam burning “clean holes in his fear.” Orientation is secure by line 3; no penalty. The doctrine of randomness vs. sequence is set up early and pays off when sequence is chosen, satisfying setup/payoff. Minor deduction: the final vow is summarized rather than dramatized in a visceral beat, softening the decisive change punch.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: pale-cloud trigger → shadow intrusion → Lio’s choice to become vessel. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: “Let me house the unbound shadows” rewires Archive rules and imposes lifelong cost. The price is on-page and felt: “luminous regret burning through each word.” Persistent constraint (his body as mobile archive) shapes all future tactics—exactly the 9+ demand.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tail encased in wire will hang at the crossroads, reconfiguring Liora’s public identity and her private self-judgment. The cost is legible in the same breath—she forfeits the relic and accepts ongoing scorn. Causal lens holds: because she tore up the sale contract, therefore she still has the tail; because she brings it tonight, therefore Mara can forge it into a public confession. No orientation debt; foggy workshop and starlight are anchored by lantern and workbench within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    A Hybrid lens (lyric-Accumulative dominant at the end) is taught by the second paragraph and holds cleanly: each vegetal whisper thickens the pattern until the coffee-ring epiphany reweights the stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s mandate shifts from sealing scars to reading them—paid for by the visible neural cost (bandage, frozen sand, ivy’s invasive voice). The one minor slack is orientation: "quiet tower" geography stays functional but never constrains choice; the ivy could murmur anywhere. Still, the ending image carries undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of spliced-out images builds density until the booth wall shows her own deleted frames. One scene, no orientation debt; anchor (who/where/when) nailed by sentence 3. Closure is Charged Poise—she lets the cooling film re-price her past. The cost is legible: she must “let new scenes grow” without recovering the originals. Causality intact: because she touches the strip → visions → re-framed identity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the astrolabe tunnels the aurora, the protagonist’s unwritten sentence empties into the valley, and the price is the ringing hollow in his skull. Causal linkage holds—each traced star tightens the internal noose until surrender is the only option. Orientation is swift ("the first time I stood...") and anchors hold. No breaks, no soft resets; the ending image reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the frozen clock and singing dune reconfigure meaning without tidy resolution, cost is the eternal vigil forfeiting sleep. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of winding, humming, spark-tending intensifies until the final “oceanic tick” reweights stakes. Orientation is taught early: ash-sky, glowing sand, buried tracks all anchor by line 4. No causality breaks; each lyrical return tightens the same constraint rather than resets it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The missing-tooth gear image delivers a tight Decisive Change with visible cost: once inserted, the forest’s hum colonizes his body ("filled my sinuses and ribs"). Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens—each awakening adds texture until the brass canopy becomes inevitable. Orientation is swift: brass leaves by line 4. Only hiccup: the prior dissociative episodes are summarized, not scened, so the first irreversible fork happens off-page; still, the final mechanism reweights all prior texture, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star sinks into her and the sea-hum becomes a held note, making the before/after of accepting passage legible with felt cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each remembered cowardice deposits a physical step, tightening the allegorical descent. Orientation is swift; who/where/when is anchored by word 90. The lens holds; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the fortress cracks, snow enters as language, and safety is re-defined as the courage to leave. The causal chain (bolt → memory → speech → collapse) tightens once under accumulative design; each flake returns a stolen syllable, making the cost audible. Orientation is taught early via “no doors, only a revolving lobby of echoes,” so no penalty. One hairline slip: the avalanche injury is summoned late as off-stage premise, but it is anchored in the lobby-phantom split and paid back in the final shatter, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the scholar’s “graceful collapse of a thought” is a Charged Poise that reweights the genealogical lie with conceptual cost. Causality holds—each library seed causes the next doubt—though the titan’s ultimate fate remains suspended. The accumulative design teaches its pattern early and pays off in a single resonant image, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s patterned tapping syncs with an anomalous swell that momentarily reveals a vanished sandbar, re-weighting the premise that oceanic paths can be summoned or forgotten. Cost is felt in the "drifting moored" final image—station and watcher both suspended over an unprinted map. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: repeated sensory beats (tapping, flicker, salt-hardened paper) accumulate until the rhythm itself rewrites the tide. One mild orientation wobble: “we” appears once before group membership is named, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sent communiqué crystallizes risk under the humming stones; “Meet at the stones…” carries undeniable social cost; inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds; persistent opera-glass constraint and barefoot contact with vibrating deck anchor the cost in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s light bleeds into the spring, reweighting destiny itself; cost is felt in the council’s thwarted certainty and the narrator’s conscious release of control. Causal chain holds: kite-script → decoded song → amber fracture → destiny unsealed. Orientation is anchored early by steam ladders and scaffolds; no disorientation persists. One causal micro-gap: the exact mechanism by which “naming choices aloud” rewrites cellular code is asserted rather than shown, a hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared via salt-fog density and photo-creases accumulating toward the Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) secured by line 3, lighthouse keeper echo closing the frame. Single scene, no teleport props; causality intact—photo folds because memory cannot be discarded. Closure: notebook page accepts folded ruin, re-configuring hope with undeniable cost—she still carries the blur of the bride.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot spread re-ordered into self-portraits crystallizes new options with felt cost—he abandons the lucrative grief-trade. Causal linkage holds: each card re-assignment is triggered by the preceding memory-flash, tightening until the lantern descent forecloses retreat. The “broken box” conceit taught early anchors the lens; no orientation debt. One minor slack: the hospital-room/Tower pairing is referenced but not dramatized, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Iren’s decision to let self “loosen” reweights the world’s editorial cuts and costs him coherent identity. Causal chain holds: eclipse→ink demo→epiphany→voluntary vanishing; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern of “skipped frames” taught early and paid at end.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: alert → breach → read → scan → transmit → falsify, each therefore tightening legal exposure. Closure is Charged Poise: the “question passed from hand to hand” reweights prior motifs with conceptual cost—her life is now forfeit if caught. Cost is legible in the wrist-ping acknowledging the false report. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: rose-rows accrue meaning until the final cadence reweights the premise under a cracked dome. Anchor beats (who/where/when) land by line 4, transitions are legible, closure arrives as Charged Poise (“another pulse”) with undeniable cost—her body now ventriloquized by the archive she cultivated. No meaningful causality lapses, though the tower event itself is off-stage and could feel like convenient backdrop; the dome’s fracture and hesitating raiders keep pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: by letting the question dissolve unsaid he rewrites the garden’s music into “new, broken rhythms,” a visible cost that re-weights the entire premise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density escalate until silence breaks the waveform; the final image re-configures meaning without causal reversals, satisfying the lens guardrail. Orientation is swift: “cool-headed fisher poled his skiff” anchors who/where/when inside 15 words. No telegraphing of stakes or abilities is violated; the grandmother whisper sets up the silence method early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat tightens options—documents arrive → revelation of emotional surveillance → proof by contradiction → decision to publish—so silence becomes untenable. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: family name will burn, ink will thunder. Orientation anchored by second paragraph; no teleporting props. One taut deepening beat inside the observatory suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the laugh reweights guilt into release, cost is the irrevocable airing of the last private sound. Causal lens holds—every beat from job acceptance to console drawer is because/therefore. No teleports; amber, letters, phone all tracked. Orientation is taught early via throat-door image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lark realizes the grotto’s mess demands outline, not erasure; the tile flake pressed into mandala sand makes the cost visible and irreversible. Causal chain holds—because she lifts the shard, the hush re-flavors and she re-sees her art as weapon/tool; therefore she kneels and draws. Orientation is taught early (mist, pit, pilgrims) and anchors by word 80, waiving any penalty. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no seams or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s air “uncoiled” and the city steps into her arms—undeniable social cost for her aberrant mercy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mosaic step layer intensifies meaning until the tessera rewrites civic time. Orientation anchor (“ancient plaza beneath the shattered sky”) arrives by word 7; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard brightens, translucent hands rise, and “let us try again” crystallizes a joint wager whose failure cost is implicit in the theater’s demolition. Causal linkage holds: because the coin is placed, Marcel agrees; therefore the Wheel might turn. One minor causality wobble: “security lights dimmed” → orchard sighs into magic is accepted as genre rule, taught early. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 4 and stay stable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Eli reframes the “curse” into a tool while the studio hum accepts the new steady traffic—felt cost is the irrevocable insomnia and ethical gray zone. Causal lens holds: static shock → residual pathways → intentional redirection; no soft reset. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no penalty. One minor ellipsis—how pill + shock = permanent link is implied not parsed—but the rule is accepted retroactively and drives tactics, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lantern-led density tightens emotional residue into a spiral pattern that reweights the cave as mutual listening post. Closure—handing the fossil to the unknown—charges the final image with conceptual cost; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal lens holds: because the cliffs stop humming, therefore Mara can hear and steal the echo; because she unscrambles buttons, she locates the crate. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3 and again at the lamp placement, well inside the 120-word window. The closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the prophecy-to-law pipeline is ruptured when the echo is freed, a repricing that makes Mara's treason irreversible. One minor ellipsis—how she learned the counter-seal—is motivated by prior mention of "old smugglers’ songs" and does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the twin pillboxes’ metallic click crystallizes a Charged Poise—Elias reconfigures his future from vengeance to quiet reconstruction, cost felt in the audible pact and the key’s unknown door. Accumulative lens holds throughout; each found object thickens the stake of loyalty versus abandonment. Causality is intact—every beat because/therefore links Marha’s codes, the snow circles, and the final gift. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where) is clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horses step forward into fog, the mother’s plea—”Let him not be afraid to leave me”—reconfigures every prior vow of keeping. The yarn needle and ambient listening are persistent constraints shaping tactics. Cost is legible in the final image: coach and script dissolve into a blank page the night must learn to read. Causal chain holds: because he listens, therefore he can ferry, therefore meaning thins to serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the timeline rule-set is rewired—kindness becomes an almost-physical force that can tilt history. Cost is visible in the final image: cooled porcelain fragility inside him, sprouts leaning toward his touch, persistent wasteland outside. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence and image density tighten once, reweighting the stake from “why green resists” to “kindness as phototropic engine.” No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors secured inside 120 words. One micro-turn: swarm/no-swarm hinges on past micro-gentleness; causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the fire escape becomes a “low-slung constellation,” reconfiguring the stake from private grief to communal offering; the cost is felt in the exposed, fragile glass that could fall or be ignored. Causal linkage holds: petal drop → invitation acknowledged → light-sculpting act → harbor echo; every beat is because/therefore, no lucky rescue. Reflective blocks are anchored to present stimuli (moon blade on cane) and alter tactics immediately; BRR cap is waived. Orientation is locked by word 30; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake—and it stays pure to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lio’s decision to “practice independence” reconfigures the library’s tides and their own stance; cost is the visible thinning of the other self into “scatter of translucence.” Causal lens holds throughout—sundial alignment summons the reflection, reflection forecloses despair, choice adjusts the floating structure. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural pattern is legible: storm → temple → spiral → letter; each beat layers density until the oculus-light mirror reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—light turning stone to mirror reconfigures the archive of unsaid things—but the cost is more atmospheric than corporeal, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: tower sale → signal shift → Mara’s subsonic counter-move → audible reply. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: campus discord is re-broadcast as cosmic invitation, cost felt when window glass rattles—military encryption now looms larger. One transition (studio→ceiling debate) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words. No meaningful escalation break; tightening occurs at subsonic patch moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the staircase of “compressed midnight” appears, cost is felt (he may lose his body or mind), and the lens stays Situational—space keeps folding in reluctant sighs. Causality is clean: broken compass → socket click → organ breath → geometry bruised → staircase. No teleporting props, no resets. The Orientation Test is waived because deliberate early disorientation (“distances lied”) pays off in the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each layered brushstroke and mist-thick sentence adds density until the canvas reweights the cold case. Closure is a Charged Poise—ribbon image trembling in “invisible breeze,” reconfiguring empathy as the only remaining path. The quarry-stone slip at the end is the audible hinge that makes the cost felt without declaring a capture. Causality is implicit rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“places remember differently”) and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Liora’s digital graft of Tamar’s stanza into the forecast makes the erased ancestor an unerasable layer of future weather—exile reverses itself in the data-cloud. Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore chain from crate → decoded coordinates → realization → deliberate contamination of the dataset. Cost is legible: “Tag what is taken, so the taken can return” reweights the station’s purpose and forecloses her own clean service record. Pattern taught early (coded stanzas) pays off in the final bureaucratic keystroke.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flake’s dust and the hitchhiker’s arrival reconfigure the night from “never” to “yes,” with the fiddler’s aching arm and frayed bow hair as felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each musical phrase and projected pane thickens the texture until one merciful timeline overwrites the others. Causality is preserved—the flake warms, vibrates, shatters, and the man returns—without explanatory exposition. Orientation is immediate: bridge pullout, mountain chasm, aching bow arm within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the worthless foreign bills re-weighted as apology-objects, inheritance mapped onto failed corridors—felt cost is legible in “papers looked…like apologies.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of circling rails and currencies intensifies until meaning, not plot, shifts. Orientation is taught early: “abandoned circus train” anchors by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: Lila’s vanishing tightens the loop, forcing solo return. Causality intact; no prop teleport or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of star-matches thickens meaning until the final ledger image reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the telescope array becomes a mirror of communal grief—cost felt in the phrase “so you would not have to carry it alone.” Orientation clean by word 120; no causal breaks. The telegram’s date-stamp anomaly is set up but never exploited as a causal constraint; it’s texture, not turn, so escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lake’s rule-set reweights when Arlen’s admission feeds the seed and cracks the ice—cost is the irreversible ownership of guilt. Causal lens holds: because the magician’s frozen confession lodged in the seed, Arlen must speak aloud the opposite truth to unbend the world. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No telegraphing props; every keepsake in the orchard earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the joint vision reconfigures options and the refusal to choose is paid for by the glowing scars and the maze’s uncontrollable sprawl. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative density of images culminates in a situational impasse. Orientation is clean by line 5; the glade, dusk, and root-bound ankles anchor instantly. One minor slack: the line “the covenant is thinning” arrives without prior textual seed, but the final image retroactively weights it, so the deduction is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the altar-mouth drinks Lio’s blood and spits out a rearranged narrator; cost is visible in Lio’s aging and the river-wool smell. Causal lens holds: because narrator places hand → therefore orchard re-stitches identity; because Lio bleeds → therefore he pays. Orientation anchors within 120 words (catacomb orchard, Lio, night). No telegraphing or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “Provenance uncertain, but history priceless to those who remember” reweights Eli’s entire professional rule-set, making factual certainty the cheap thing and remembered fellowship the invaluable. Cost is visible on-page: he forfeits the catalog certainty the auction house pays for, embracing a stance that could lose the gig. Causal lens holds throughout because the grille-cloth find functions as a because/therefore pivot that narrows options to either lie or declare authenticity-with-a-fable. No orientation debt; quarry trailer, temp-agency context, and dusk timeline are anchored by word 100.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fisherman leaves carrying a newly alloyed, contradiction-tolerant identity, paid for by the librarian’s internal furnace and the absent moon’s tide. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure intensifies through image-density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“tidal atrium”), waived penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: “his reflection… borrows my metal jaw,” a mutual, irreversible metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored facet, shell, and pearl layer thickens the same question—what survives, the body or the heart—until the final image reweights “safety.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the provisional “safe” tick-box is dwarfed by the felt reopening aboveground. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early (“layer upon quiet layer”) and paid off when the pearl crowns their hesitation with undeniable light.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the narrator writes both names on the same unsteady line—conceptual cost is unmistakable. Pattern taught early: river station as archive of guilt; each object (accordion, graffiti) layers density until the final cadence shifts meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causal breaks. The persistent constraint—his recorder’s prior betrayal—shapes every present tactic; final image reweights the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she abandons documentation itself, reweighting the premise that knowledge must be fixed. Causal chain holds—each silence-test → shelf-shift → map of absence → renunciation—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The “cyclically reversed” watch and mist-gate rules stay consistent; orientation anchors within 120 words. Cost is legible: her Institute resignation literally evaporates, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the annotated contract reweights truth itself, melting the violin and the empire’s myth. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (ivy hiss, coffee sigil, river memory) tightens the stake until the refusal ruptures the frame. Cost is legible in the single water drop that seals the loss of both grant and song.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the split tone in the “roaring quiet” reweights every prior infusion; the emerald’s fracture is the persistent constraint shaping tactics. Causal chain holds: because each face is infused, therefore the chip cracks; because it cracks, the final tone is possible. Cost is legible in the cracked emerald and her shaken hand—no explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored seed sprouting from stone re-weights forgiveness from moral reward to seasonal rotation; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the hairpin, scallop shell entrance, and vineyard hush all recur with shifted charge—felt cost is the literal splitting open of the keepsake that once held her mother’s dying scent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the coin keeps spinning, nuance welcomed at undeniable emotional cost (“something softer has entered the room… unerasable”). Causal lens holds—because Mara articulates the fear, therefore the narrator withholds absolution, reconfiguring her stance. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props or logic breaks. Persistent constraint (the unerasable choice) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: Mora’s hollow is felt, Elian’s refusal forecloses the expected spectacle, and the cost is the apprentice’s new dread. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—rings, hush, magnetic hum tighten meaning until the final image reweights vanishing as responsibility, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the canyon “arrange[s] itself in ringing layers” while he becomes the unmoving coordinate—conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds: each skimming stone thickens the sonic map until silence itself is a path. Causality is interior but rigorous: because he refuses to move, the world re-maps around his stillness. Final image reweights premise without exposition: “he finally knew where he was” = navigation redefined as resonance, not travel.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant he steps, options narrow to one—no rail, no tower, only cloud-lit mist. Causality holds because every beat (keystone tug, stair discovery, warmth bleed) is an because/therefore push toward this ledge. The tagline “accommodates impossibilities” is seeded early and repriced at the end: the impossible action becomes the only viable path. Felt cost is in the body: vertigo acknowledged, harness abandoned, no return possible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each glowing vow adds density until Elias’s own promise reweights the world. Closure is a Charged Poise—he surfaces hearing colors—cost paid in irrevocable perceptual shift. Pattern taught by line 3 (“color of sound”) and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral pattern is rejected, coins left on the floor, hands placed on the dial—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the old method with felt cost. Causal chain holds: backwards warning → refusal to cast → manual retuning. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of metallic spirals and static hums tightens meaningfully. The “static washed through me” image makes the cost undeniable, satisfying the 9+ cost proof test even though earlier causal links are lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory floor glitters with named terrors, the reaper’s purpose reframed from harvest to witness. Causality holds: because the child’s sacrifice scarred him, he now crystallizes fears instead of reaping them. The atlas, lantern, and recordings form a closed causal loop that reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative design holds; drip alignment is the decisive micro-turn that reconfigures both sea and self with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each surfaced artifact (label, photos) tightens the same stake—will Tomas keep pretending the town is safely erased? Trail of photographs acts as pattern break that reweights meaning; final image of neighbors’ listening faces becomes Charged Poise where cost is the lifelong burden of story-keeping he now accepts. Closure legible under lens, no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crystal’s petal-bloom reconfigures perception, and the cost is felt in “tears stung his eyes” while logic is still standing. Drive lens is lyric-accumulative; density and cadence tighten once rather than causal chain, satisfying the short-form rule. Orientation is secure by line 3; no teleporting props. The missing beat: we never see the lullaby’s scrap physically used or risked, so the sentimental set-up stays conceptually, not causally, paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the report-beam leaves the arbor, foreclosing the false promise with undeniable social cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—static density clears to sentence, cadence shifts, options reweighted. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no causal breaks; cost is legible in “weight of my choice” and the “unseen revision of its stories.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each memory-strike tightens the stakes for custodianship of the jarred mind. The final refusal to erase guilt is a decisive change with visible cost—Kesh’s nod signals the ruling is now tainted by mercy. History-rewrites are taught early and payoff at closure when the dojo rocks drift closer, literalizing the rewritten verdict. No orientation debt; anchoring floats but serves the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (mud, brook-groan, seed-cold) thickens the same stake—will the town stay safely commodified or let the strange grow. Closure is a Charged Poise: “entrance instead” reconfigures the escape room’s meaning with felt conceptual cost. One causal hop—coordinates “beneath the town” arrive un-earned—drops this from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf-blower roar → phantom laughter → parental bark/giggle reweights the silence; Lysander’s Charged Poise at “pull cord handle hangs warm” shows cost without tidy resolution. Causal chain holds: because he dials engines to stall, therefore harmonic memory macerates, therefore upstairs laughter cracks open. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“tunnel under the old house” + time marker). No lens ambiguity; accumulation pattern taught early and paid off. Meets 9+ quick test with persistent constraint (the tunnel’s acoustic price) shaping final image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the library garden hardens into a single corridor, pendant accepted, “uncertainty arrives in different costumes” crystallizes both option and cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each imagistic shard (hoarfrost paper-dust, lantern-glass, margin-note identity) layers density until the final pause re-weights the stake. Causality is lyric but legible: because the narrator confesses friendship with doubt, therefore the guardian grants the threshold tool. Cost is visible in the instant he sees his exhausted alter-ego—proof that the ache is endless yet portable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crozier’s authority is melted into anonymous possibility and the kingdom’s ledger of fate is quietly re-balanced. Causal linkage holds: because he cracks the symbol, blessings reroute—shown in the montage of strangers stepping away from conscription tables. The lens (Causal) is taught by “tonight he trusted in creative destruction instead” and holds through the final image of cooling coals. Persistent constraint is visible: the bishop’s ring in his pocket is now inert metal, proof of irreversible theft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensuous layer (rust confetti, ghost-applause, skipped heartbeat) tightens the central stake until the narrator’s redirective promise reweights the city’s fate. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dial-tone sigh crystallizes options and cost without forcing a physical act. Orientation is taught by line 5; no caps triggered. Persistent constraint: the shard’s silence now lives in the narrator’s veins, shaping future listening.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrative layers sensory and metaphysical repetitions (radio braid, ferry disappearances, mirrored grotto) until a Charged Poise re-weights the premise. Closure lands cleanly—Eli’s single clear note aimed at absence crystallizes the possibility of plaited permanence—but the cost is conceptual rather than embodied; the story tells us “he chose home” without on-page consequence or forfeiture, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal linkage holds: the thread request → weaving → doorway choice forms a clean because/therefore spine. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the frozen doorway crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation is taught early through the corridor-fold and pays off in the mutable gallery. One minor causality wobble: the architect’s “professional reluctance” is asserted but never manifests in altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each sensory layer (pressure dome, manganese plain, alien spires) adds density until the star-edge web reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator frames sky with rusted iron, embracing a curriculum he cannot yet teach—cost is the unknown future, visible in the final image. Causality is interior but coherent: because he once navigated by stars, therefore he accepts Mirror’s lesson, therefore the chain becomes lens rather than anchor. Orientation rock-solid by line 3; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: delivering the unsent sentence re-weights the city’s death-registry logic into a private moral act whose cost is Eren’s procedural breach and the audible fracture of Deniz’s composure. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the hearing aid twitches → Eren climbs → because he climbs → he finds the phone → because he listens → he must call. The “incidental heroism” reframes the entire bureaucratic frame without breaking it. No teleporting props; the photograph, the torn chain-lock, and the blinking voicemail all pay off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Noah’s choice to leave with the humming sphere is crystallized in the last clause “whispering of return,” a Charged Poise that forecloses leaving the past sealed. Causal linkage holds: gold fleck → sphere → temporal drift warning → renunciation of full escape. The orientation anchors (who/when/where) hit by line 3; facility purpose and tide clock are clear before 120 words. Cost is felt: four-hour window already shrinking, sphere’s “negative mass” promises future toll; lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “together we are writing who she will become” reweights the premise with unambiguous cost—he accepts an unfinished, co-authored ghost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fragmented imagery (snowflakes freeze midfall, porcelain shard, ink constellations) tightens until meaning crystallizes at final waveform. Orientation clean: who/where/when anchored by line 25. No causality breaks; escalation is density-driven, because/therefore links intact.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the instant his voice fuses with the canyon, the language is reborn yet he is irretrievably woven into its bone dust—cost felt in the sparkling powder falling. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each texture-note adds density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), lens taught early via cranes-grammar analogy, pattern intact. No causal plot holes; every echo is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-phone-garden triad reweights the premise—lost people become “what the mountain cannot carry alone.” Causal chain (arrow → doorway → phone → confession-seeds) is tight; each step narrows the investigator’s options. Accumulated texture escalates to irreversible stance shift. Cost is unmistakable in the final line: bitter joke accepted with soil still trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lio stands on the rising branch, music still flowing, machines dark, city in vertigo—felt cost is unmistakable (“bruised velvet dome over metal skeletons”). Causal chain is intact: locust shell → heard orchard pulse → bow-matched rhythm → copper harness snaps → statues leaf. Lens holds (Causal). Orientation complete at sentence 3; no drift. Single elastic scene; one transition (sky-bridge to bough) is legible and part of the final image. No telegraphing, no amnesia, no soft reset. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Situational lens holds: escalating border tension funnels into the arcade’s neutral hour; coincidence (drones ignore the corridor) complicates rather than rescues. Orientation anchors within 120 words: bruised-cobalt sky, empty arcade, twilight, mailman in disputed corridor. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara weighing rebellion vs. storm-risk while the cork trembles—cost is the town’s potential drowning or healing, felt in the final image “thin as smoke.” Persistent constraint: every crack could be claimed by two flags, shaping every cautious step.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—cadence shift from dust-mute to singing-spin charges the stake. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the halted carousel turns, halo dims to watchful glow, wind bells become doorway not countdown—all on-page with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 10; no causality breaks. Minor −0.3: the “wrong turn” mechanic is asserted rather than spatially prepared, but it merely admits him to the oasis, not a causal pivot, so caps nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hyperbolic search folds into the simple image of a human body waiting to speak—cost is the obsolescence of her cartographic obsession. Causality holds: every receipt-path leads to the poet’s pause, and that pause is shown, not explained. Orientation is swift: dusk opening, scarf anchor, single POV. One minor loop: “analog memories” is twice defined in adjacent sentences; trim for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sunrise captured adds density until the final image reweights the archive and the self; closure is a Charged Poise where the archive is “fixed with indelible, tender clarity” and the protagonist’s emptiness is the felt price. Orientation anchors (island, stone library, pre-dawn) land within 120 words; no penalty. Pattern of jar-label ciphers and palette-glass fragments is taught early; transitions are legible across storm-season montage. The persistent constraint—she must keep shooting or the islands thin—shapes every beat; cost is legible in the final hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Plot hinges on a single, legible causal chain: vial-offer → uncorking → internal hinge-shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the starlit “begin” reweights every prior locked thought with undeniable cost under Causal lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no prop or rule drifts. The star-hint mechanic is set up early and paid off in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test. Only the lightest skim of redundancy in fear-thanking keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every return of memory is earned by kneeling in the fungal ring, and the tide’s re-entry makes the cost—continuing memory-loss—undeniable. Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator climbs out owning an incomplete but authentically his story, with the constraint that curiosity now permanently erodes other facts.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rhea’s promise reconfigures stakes while the reversible-exile rule persists with felt cost. The drive lens is situational-accumulative—pressure crystallizes stance rather than pivots plot—and holds without wobble. Orientation is taught early (“By the time Rhea found…”) and the final image of ink-fold shadows in glass reweights prior motifs. Cost is visible in the same breath as the promise, satisfying Q2’s 9+ cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the seed absorbs the imagined rainbow-city, the orchard brightens, and the narrator’s stance reconfigures from spectator to keeper; the cost is the unspoken probability that the city may never change. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each imagistic layer (gray memory → color wish → seed glow) tightens the cadence rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Holds Accumulative/Textural lens throughout: each unraveled knot thickens the silence rather than forwarding plot causality, and closure lands as Charged Poise—the sanctuary air now “grounded,” a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored by line 7 (“prism sanctuary under starlight”), well before 120 words, satisfying the single-scene window; no causality breaks, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the chapel shifts from “unknown” ruin to active listener, and Elias’s mandate to reopen it “only as a place to listen” reweights the entire premise with social cost—the museum must now guard silence, not artifacts. Causality holds: the map tear → missing chapel → footage → apology → new use. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early by the repeated image of listening to silence, and the final cadence crystallizes meaning without causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s decision to split the salvage—cylinder up, globes left—reweights the premise, making the physics of letting go empirical and personal. Causal linkage holds: every beat from globe-touch to cylinder-theft drives this final choice; no lucky rescue. Orientation is firm by line 6 (who = wreck-mapper, where = coral cliff, when = post-Earhart). Cost is on-page: “felt like mourning” acknowledges irreversible loss of experimental purity. Lens is Causal; each because/therefore tightens until the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the city’s raw confessions (“I AM LONELY”) reweight every prior mural into public grammar, cost legible in the overheated bolt plate and Lio’s unvoiced throat. Causal chain: copper dust etchings → code-ghost awakened → graffiti grammar reversed → city exhales. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no disorientation debt. Lens holds as Causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Persistent constraint: once the wall speaks, Lio’s private code is permanently socialized—an irreversible price.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Etta decides to carry the captain’s “method” back down, a renunciation that re-weights how she will read future suffering. Causal chain holds—goggles reveal seams, script is decrypted by kindness not force, diary reconfigures her perception—cost is the cold corridor and the now-undeniable responsibility to see joy beneath anguish. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-scatter decryption tightens meaning once; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself is declared archive, reweighting the premise at the last line. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of cloud/emotion taxonomy and repeated cable-memory images tighten until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift: “sky gondola rocked… lanterns swinging” inside 25 words. Causality holds: severed cable → drift → discovery of atmospheric memory → decision to memorialize through data, each step because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the compressed-sky book becomes an Earned Stasis—Mara accepts the tree’s demolition by finishing the portable sky, cost felt in the “boards seemed ready to warp.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each painted stripe layers prior ceilings until pattern break (no more space) reweights stakes. Causality intact: coin-touch → finds secret safe → obtains blank book → paints final sky. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3. Cost legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: starling light-pools accrue until they re-weight the meaning of play lines, producing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is secured inside 120 words via dusk, airship deck, and apprentice task. One tight transition—below deck—keeps continuity; hopscotch board becomes causal instrument, not prop. Closure lands as charged poise: corridor of clear sky opens because Lio’s choreography forced it, cost felt in crew’s unseen but listening presence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative lens is declared early (“I had come to learn the rhythm of repair”) and holds: each mirror beat thickens the texture of release until the library itself thaws. Causality is poetic, not mechanical—gears become keys by sympathetic magic—yet the pattern is legible and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost: the building breathes, the locksmith is spent. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt applies. The only slack is that the prophecy scraps act as a soft permission rather than a tightening constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bell and lashed-together orchard drifting toward the nebula reconfigure survival itself. Causal chain holds: chalk messages → crowd trust → collective harnessing → arch-crossing. Cost is legible in the bell’s fracture and the abandoned ladders. One minor slack: the nebula “soft harbor” rule is foretold, not tested, so the final lift feels semi-mythic rather than earned physics.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality holds: broken puppet → mechanism shudder → chamber walk → clock fade forms a clean because/therefore chain. The lighthouse door “sequence of years” seed pays off the early disorientation, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world still burns but some rooms stay intact, with undeniable conceptual cost (“the world did not end all at once”). One minor slack: the “nested patterns” mechanic is taught only by metaphor, not demonstrated until the corridor walk; still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is legible and held to the final dimming.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blueprint’s sentient desire becomes undeniable, reframing every prior guide-choice as complicity. Causal lattice holds—each guided traveler tightens the spiral toward this revelation. The nut’s return in the final beat carries visible conceptual cost: freedom may require surrendering the self to the maze. Lens (Causal) is taught early and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: river-braid imagery threads past accident into polymer redesign, landing a Charged Poise at the ravine edge. Closure reweights guilt into “something more spacious,” with conceptual cost (patent interest vs. private grief) legible. One soft spot: the resin breakthrough is summarized, not scene-tested, so the causal link between river insight and lab success is elliptical rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: signing the slate makes the library’s catalog swallow both their absences, a legible before/after. The causal chain holds: the vendor’s instruction to pair slate + bottle → their joint pouring → the slate’s refusal to blank but instead engrave their rejections → the new catalog entry. Orientation is taught early (“floating upon a swirling sea of clouds” by line 1) and payoff comes when the branch-aisle literally re-files him.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final cot-line image of the fortress waiting for “next rain” reconfigures the whole cycle—Rafi’s nightly descent, the garrison’s muted laughter—into an endless maintenance of communal pain. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard-tasting beat thickens the texture of shared remorse until the quiet hush of dinner becomes the decisive change. Cost is legible in Rafi’s trembling hand sealing the darkest shard, foreclosing the option to ever serve that memory. Pattern taught early (tidal pool = menu oracle) and paid off in the shrinking courtyard pools that mirror the returned-to-frost shards below.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each hourly chime layers density until the final plaza canon reweights the stake—city-as-one-body. Closure is a Charged Poise: the open chutes exhale cool air while the crowd hears itself “many chambers, beating in time,” a crystallized image whose conceptual cost (permanent public intimacy) is undeniable. Causality holds via the pinecone weight chain and the multilingual braid that resolves discord into harmony; no off-stage solves. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“inside its wheezing stone ribs worked Mara”) and again at descent, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Lio’s reflection dissolves into a composite of other gazes, proving he has paid with personal identity. Causal chain holds—because he rewires his own neurons, therefore the canyon calms and he hosts communal memory. Cost is legible in the final image: “he could feel countless new vectors… inside him.” Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are fixed by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the codex imprinting “watchful stars” into memory visibly reprices his agency and the world’s safeguards. Causal chain holds: inversion hour → wall thins → doodle unfolds → chains test → book loads → hour ends. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. One minor scaffold: “seeds of vigilance” is named twice before we see one act—costs a breath of immediacy but doesn’t break lens. Accum/Textural lens valid; density tighten from motes to chained lightning charges stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove’s shared pulse reconfigures meaning—silence is no longer absence but a new medium—cost is the unending labor of sustaining motion. Causal linkage holds: fracture map → copper wire → communal sway. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and intact at final image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s pulses accept Oren’s counteroffer, the stone’s dent deepens—an on-page, irreversible change with social cost (he remains exiled but redefined). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: silence accumulates as legible pattern, the final image reweights all prior quiet. Causality is intact—exile now reads as purposeful sacrifice rather than punishment. Cost is undeniable in the final line where “the future had pressed its thumb beside his own.”

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is stable: each silenced layer thickens the tonal density until the final white glare reweights the premise. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—the unclasping crystallizes options (he can now hear Mira’s silence) and carries conceptual cost: his archive will include the very noise he dreads. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“shadowed workshop under stars”) and causality is intact: the fireworks’ imminent roar motivates the gain roll-down that enables the diary capture. One hairline slip: the “police report → memorial” ellipsis is a touch convenient, trimming 9.0 by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the village inhales, options reweighted by the planted seed whose future stench is now inevitable; conceptual cost is undeniable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of scent motifs and rope-creak cadence tighten until the pause at moss cradle. Causality holds: confession → seed → ascent → permission → planting, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) delivered by sentence 3; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-seed rewrites the world’s logic from “impossible orchards” to “intentional defiance,” with cost = perpetual guardianship. Causal chain is tight: inversion → water tracer → hollow → arrow → new knowledge. Orientation anchored by 90 words; no lens ambiguity. Only waver: off-page “elders said” moment (retroactive motive) but it doesn’t break the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the investigator re-weights wind from “background noise” to “living participant,” paying with exhausted acceptance; causal chain holds—each gust measurement tightens the vector geometry that foreclosed avoidance; patch fray stands as persistent constraint shaping final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—every chiseled hush must be caught—and the final release of the prism-song into aurora-colors is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise: wonder is certified as oxygen, not ornament. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—the glacier’s inhale, the shared breath between sculptor and ringer—so closure lands with felt weight. No orientation debt; transitions are fluid inside one luminous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: silence and stone density increase until the single frayed note reweights everything. Orientation is immediate; causality is interior—because the flute choked, therefore Cael seeks its mute wisdom. Closure is a Charged Poise: the amphitheater holds the imperfect sound as new bridge, with felt cost in the open-ended “path weaving between worlds inside himself.” No artifact obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the geometry dissolves the “I” that was defined as the one left behind. Causal chain holds: star-death residue → topaz press → transposed empathy → shaken identity. Orientation anchors within 50 words; workshop/star pair is never confused. Cost is unmistakable in “sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the courier re-weights his life-rule from constant motion to deliberate lingering; the pendant’s sympathetic vibration and the aurora’s hush provide the visible, felt cost, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens whose pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mosaic two-shard structure (loom orchard → puzzle window) is taught by 25 % and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the finished puzzle exhales warm breath that turns distant footsteps, reweighting silence into answer. Causal linkage holds—because she unweaves the tapestry, the blizzard image breathes back—with persistent constraint (bare loom) visible in the final line. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity at closure. Cost is legible: “the orchard felt abruptly older” after the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stone becomes supple ladder, world re-configured—but the cost is conceptual rather than personal; Corren’s own stake never tightens. Causality is soft: the silk “shivers toward the dark,” yet the reader must accept that cloth remembers intact ladders without shown rules. The arches’ gravity logic is poetic, not procedural, so the final image feels earned atmospherically but not mechanically. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props, yet the missing bridge between “divining silk” and “stone obeys story” keeps the beat just shy of decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each visitation loop tightens because Lio refuses to map himself; shard contact therefore collapses parallel corridors and severs repetition. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—green shard reweights life-rule from external commission to self-authorship, cost felt in ozone-quiet reassembly. Orientation anchored by word 30; disorientation later serves closure. One causal artifact: “engines long shut down but never quite at rest” could imply conscious engines—minor, does not breach.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the stacking of stones, letters, and the extinguished beam until the green shard refracts a private halo that reweights Elias’s identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rearranged stones and unanswered letter crystallize a lifelong, unpaid duty. Cost is unmistakable—“the luminescent ache” and the scrap of boots erasing the invitation—making the before/after legible: he exits not as delivery man but as secret keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: hum → recognition of stored promise → decision to tilt beam. The lighthouse’s stored reflection literally refracts his past letter into present command; closure is the decisive physical act of aiming dawn-shadows upward, cost legible in the weight of “hoarded shadows” he must now launch. Orientation anchors (who=Orrin, where=emerald lighthouse, when=night print press died) land before 120 words and serve the final image. No teleporting props or soft resets; every optic rule is taught by action.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wing’s shimmer reframes the patrons as mirrors, not magnets, re-weighting the core question with visible cost—his bow acknowledges unrecoverable distance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each added testimony thickens the mist of longing until the final image re-configures meaning. Orientation is clean—floating tea-house, dusk, valley mist all anchored by word 60. No causal reversal is needed under this lens; the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sextant’s re-calibration to trees reframes “quantified sorrow” as legible forgiveness, felt when dawn light hits the open ledger. Accumulative/texture lens holds from first hollow tower inhale to final rooftop hum; sorrow-density accumulates, then reweights meaning. Causality is internal—because Milo listened, therefore he sees—and the price is permanent attention he can neither renounce nor share. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 50.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mica window brightens not because an external sky returns but because the populace’s returned memories refract through them, reweighting the realm’s survival with undeniable conceptual cost—“the realm shuddered under the sudden honesty.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each shard-released memory tightens the chord of song that Mara threads backward until the window can no longer absorb starlight but must throw back color. Lens holds from first chiming root to last vanishing weight in the satchel.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invitation transforms from secret token to public promise, cost paid in the tear-washed space. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore linked to the voicemail revelation. One meaning-tightening beat at the gray book; no trace of outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: pattern of noticing > sharing > witnessing culminates in Charged Poise—the bread’s dissolution reweights “quiet complicity” with undeniable sensory cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) delivered by line 4, no penalty. Causality is lyric-retroactive: each sensuous micro-choice (unwrap, tear, dip) escalates meaning, not danger, and the final image crystallizes options without outline chatter. Closure beat is visibly felt: “warmth still rises…defiantly” makes the cost breathable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean CR: Serin’s amendment reprices the founding contract, making conceptual cost (eternal remembrance) legible in the pulse-stabilized lantern. Causal chain holds: because the slide dims faster than predicted → therefore Serin must read aloud → because meaning stabilizes light → therefore he adds his own vow, braiding not replacing. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Slight escalation waver: the “external tide” hint is never traced to a concrete agent or constraint, blunting because/therefore at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Loretta’s stance crystallizes as she chooses to keep listening, the truce of hush now internalized; cost is legible in the phrase “her unease settled beside her like company she had chosen.” Causal lens holds throughout: each beat advances because/therefore—coins for fob, fob for memory, memory for renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 10; no ambiguity at end. No artifact touches the final image; rhythm and propulsion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (aurora, taste-notes, weather-coats) thickens until the closing tableau reweights the stake—archiving seasons inside bodies. The ring’s melt-into-vein supplies a visible, irreversible price, satisfying the closure-gate; causality is lyric, not mechanical, yet coherent. Orientation is taught early through aurora-brush and voting trees; no ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored image (laughter echo, crystal glow, charcoal dust) layers density until the final canvas-rehang crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“charcoal dust moons his fingertips”) and never wavers; transitions are tacit but legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the broken lock’s hollow click and the freshly drawn eyes reconfigure the stakes without resolving them, leaving the cost in the crystal’s “morningless, auroral sorrow.” No causality breaks; every object is introduced before it constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: dried oasis → sealed city → map fragment → postal plate → observatory door clicks open; each beat narrows options. The map puzzle is dramatized on the warm floor, not summarized, supplying the required visible work. Closure is a Decisive Change: the gate opens, the city’s withheld breath is released, and Lio cannot retreat; the cost is the sensory assault of “stale ink and long-delayed honesty” that greets him. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“studio high above the condensation banks”) and never breaks; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hanging relics → wind chord → visitor cleansing is taught early and re-weighted when the shard re-tunes the tower. Closure is a Charged Poise: sculpture keeps singing, Lio’s voice gone, cost is legible (“last warmth of speech leave his throat”). Orientation anchored by line 3 (“whispering bluff above the clouds”). No lens ambiguity; pattern holds. Micro-drag: causal linkage between shard and city-wide “pause” is implied not shown, a hairline gap preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crate-link is severed, static mutates from “radio snow” to “distant surf,” and the compass re-centers—cost is unmistakable on the page. Causal chain holds: reroute power → soil desiccation → thermal partition ignition → containment of nightmares; each “because” tightens options until containment itself becomes the irreversible act. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“glass-domed enclosure at dawn”) and never wavers; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of compress-burn-reorder—held to final “quietly ordered” garden. No plot amnesia, full 9-band eligibility met.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain (locket → mailbox → sealed agreement → developers retreat) is tight and legible; the cement surrender beat supplies a sensory micro-turn that pays off the setup. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard’s legal status is rewoven in a single image—signature pages curled like dried bougainvillea—so the “before” (imminent demolition) and “after” (protected commons) are unmistakable. Cost is felt in the collective hush and the crumbling mortar, though Mara’s personal price stays oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator codes the drowned servers into “open channels,” reweighting the lab from tomb to clandestine heart—cost is the likelihood of surface-world reprisal left hanging in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dice-pattern density, swollen pages, and oceanic breathing layer until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end. One 0.1 dock because the actual keystrokes of the liberation are elided; we get the intent but not the tactile act, softening decisive-change snap.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cup-to-crystal transfer reweights the entire memory-drain premise with undeniable cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each extinguished lantern and salt blur thickens the same atmospheric rule. Pattern taught by 25% (lantern/snuff ⇄ gravity trough) holds cleanly. Final image crystallizes options: he can now “exhume” memories, but only at the price of drowning in their gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught by sentence two—“night folded itself”—and holds: each hush-layer thickens until the final image reweights silence as future possibility. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane’s glow pours over water, futures un-fixed, cost felt in Ilen’s bone-heaviness. One soft spot: the prophecy’s mechanics (why a rhythm collapses kingdoms) is asserted, not demonstrated, but the pattern pays off in the luminous final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers sensory mosaics until the rooftop meteor shower reweights the stake. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; the kettle-groan cue bridges planes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seal’s empty circle re-tunes the building’s voice and the narrator’s tenancy, charging “agreed upon lies” with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; the ghost’s scheduling aphorism is the persistent constraint that shapes every tea session.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Neris re-weights her lifelong guilt-quarantine into an archive she can study; the caretaker’s lantern paling to morning light delivers visible cost—night of exposure, no absolution yet. Causal linkage holds: shell → memory → caretaker revelation → stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (velvet garden, twilight, stone bench) arrive by line 6; no debt. One shard only; default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: every altered decree tightens tonight’s risk; the heritage thorn anchors back-story to present choice within 120 words. Key-without-lock taught as symbolic release, pays off when pressed into palm just before the decisive signature—visible cost is exile from anonymity. Closure is clean Charged Poise: “within the wisely enduring sanctuary a different script… had begun” reconfigures all prior forgeries. No orientation debt; transitions tight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s “debts” reframe Liora’s blame into custodianship; cost is the unrecoverable sister-pattern, felt in the shell’s surf-sound. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each echo-layer thickens meaning until the final cadence shift reconfigures stakes. Orientation crisp by 40 words; no teleporting props; no因果 breaks. One scaffold loop (“voices…voices…voices”) in third-last paragraph dulls the image fractionally, preventing 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the woman's tears freeze while the glacier creaks and candles flare, crystallizing the new ethical load she must carry. Causality holds throughout: the girl's dream-cameo propels the climb; Marek's wreck-archive authorizes the accusation; the visitor's ancestry converts abstract guilt into a present, payable debt. Cost is legible in the image of frozen droplets and the audible ice-shift under their feet. Drive lens is causal and uninterrupted; no orientation debt or late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: demure-audacity stance crystallizes in the whisk-droplet test, reweighting the invisible-labor stake with visible cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening beat—the moon-path flick—suffices, but causality is soft: moonlight is treated as agent (“the current does half the work”) without establishing rules earlier. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. Reflection stays under 20 % and feeds the present choice, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diamond’s template function is revealed, Theo’s refusal reweights the Committee’s governance model, and the orchard’s continued life becomes the cost he accepts. Causal chain intact: letters → diamond → stillpoint protocol → refusal. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: respirator, poisoned roots, and the diamond itself shape tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of rain-lashed cobalt glass while the Choir “argue cheerfully” reweights the stake—dawn will remember the bargain. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static density rises from “chipped teacup” through “bruised purples and feverous greens” to the storm-night aquarium. Causality is intact: Voice’s invitation → Ilen’s obedience → crystallized stance. Cost is legible in the final clause “the dawn would remember this bargain.” Hairline slip: “lyrically prophetic” is a touch outline-ish, −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the jar’s transfer crystallizes his vocation from hoarder to bridge-builder, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost implicit in “pockets empty except for pennies.” Causality is accumulative-textural; the pattern of bottling/listening taught early holds to the final image. Orientation is swift—dunes, dawn, loft—so no penalty; only the woman’s appearance edges coincidence, yet it complicates, not resolves, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lighthouse exhales, ice quiets, and Elias stands in an earned stasis whose cost is the drained sunset and his raw throat—felt on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every increment of pitch, light, and vibration thickens until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; no debt. Causality is intact: because the binding note drifted, therefore Elias adapts the rite; because he sings, therefore the sphere forgives and the marina falls silent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the basin’s current reweights the narrator’s mission, turning “sculpt patience from impatience” from slogan to lived constraint. Cost is felt—his brother’s hammer, mother’s clamped jaw, his own tapping feet are foreclosed futures. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated micro-tasks accrue density until the basin pattern crystallizes meaning. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the investigator’s apology reweights every prior “unpreventable” report, cost felt in budget-endangered future. Causal chain holds: lantern flare → apparition → recognition → vow to write truth. Orientation anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once under moral pressure. Only hairline slip: apology is offstage whisper—slightly under-cranked as decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: Jonah hands over the heart → Elias flees to Mara → Mara’s repair reframes the parole question. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elias must stand beside the imperfect ticking, not declare merit. Cost is legible in the final line—“what you are willing to stand beside”—but the off-stage parole board keeps the consequence slightly abstract; a hairline slip from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the sky is pierced, the bell realizes itself, Orin whoops in ringing silence—cost is felt in the Algorithm’s prior leash and the acid mist still on his cheeks; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the pattern of yearning→vector→launch taught early and paid off in the final image without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the archive’s “buried subnet” reweights the meaning of deletion and of Ora’s vanishing. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each 713 echo tightens the pattern until silence itself becomes a coordinate. Cost is legible in the final line: “I closed the interface, knowing…”—knowledge that bars him from innocence. The inferred lens is taught early and paid off without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice is tight: every mirror-glimpse narrows Ira’s viable choices until only co-authorship of a new accord remains. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—he re-constitutes the treaty in real time while holding the cracked futures, a visible conceptual cost that forecloses both colonial seizure and passive peacekeeper neutrality. Orientation is swift (lighthouse orchard by line 3) and the shattered-crystal motif teaches its own grammar early, satisfying mosaic drive.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the vibration in the water reweights the premise, making the cost of living/dying legible without declaring either. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → tactile objects → ice music accumulates until the final image folds patience open. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the week-long wait—shapes every tactic. Cost is undeniable in the final image: “a narrow but undeniable path back” carries social, existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the station’s held breath after the woman decides to stay and try again; the cost is Tomas’s renewed solitude, felt as he “keeps watch” while she walks back toward the road. Causal lens holds throughout: the letter fragment triggers the parallel he draws, which reframes her lateness from failure to poetic rhyme. Orientation is clean inside 120 words: “vacant station,” “vineyard sentinel,” “autumn,” “last bus gone.” No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise without explanatory speech.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn reveals a “quiet, enduring wall” of echoes, a Charged Poise that forecloses forgetting. Causal linkage holds throughout—each denied truth literally grinds the buried parapet, and each honest acceptance stills it. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“inside the murmuring pavilion”) and never breaks. Cost is legible in the final image: the dunes “rested” and the parapet “slept,” a conceptual repricing that makes silence itself the earned prize.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s fragments constellate and the archivist feels “lighter,” a conceptual cost that reweights his role. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photo/object adds density until the final communal puzzle crystallizes. Causality is loose but coherent under this lyric design; however, the cost is more reported (“I shocked myself by feeling lighter”) than viscerally shown, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: courier note → crystal listening → tactical decision to testify in fractured sequences. Orientation locked by line 5; no disorientation penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias descends wearing “barely audible armor,” options reweighted, cost felt. Minor slip: “the council will erase three verbs” is off-stage fiat; still, it triggers all action and is paid for by his public risk, so causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn erases the prophet’s chalk, tightening the pattern of build-and-loss until the ultimate erasure on the refrigerator. Orientation is taught early via the chapel made of fridges and smoke statues, so disorientation is functional. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank metal retains an invisible future the characters must now carry, a felt cost heavier than the words themselves. The only minor drag is a mid-story loop of “listen to the hiss” that slightly stalls momentum before the bed-sculpture discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ilias’s stolen raw data at literal shudder-crest reweights the observatory’s future and immortalizes Alma’s creed. Causal linkage is airtight—each quake aftershock therefore narrows his options until bypassing the dampers becomes the single viable path. Orientation is complete inside 50 words; no lens ambiguity; cost is the station’s structural integrity and his career. The ending image of eyelid-like shutters sealing the clarity carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final silence is full, not empty, reweighting the stake from “execute a flawless goodbye” to “let silence be enough.” The broken vinyl shard returns as Conceptual Repricing—its prior fracture now re-valued as the part that never needs fixing, making the cost of non-repair legible. Causal lens holds: because she withholds the results, therefore the song can finish in breathable space; because she hands him the shard, therefore the goodbye is performed without words. Cost is on the page: “It was, she felt, enough”—the felt cost is her acceptance of inadequacy as adequacy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: illicit ascent → key/socket → spoon/loop ritual → aperture opens → shadow origin revealed → scholar altered. Closure is a Charged Poise: “disciplined, terrifying freedom” reweights the world-rule with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; lens (Causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the substitute body dissolving into soil reweights the entire premise—doubt itself becomes fertile.  The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early (the too-exact corpse as counterfeit text) and tightens through iterative images of forgery, receipts, and star-maps until the final soil-crumble crystallizes the cost.  Causality holds: Tomas’s prior theft of the tooth and planting of the fake body are motivated by his “absurdly precise” compassion; Mara’s finishing of the rescue is the necessary physical act that repays the error.  Persistent constraint—the changeling child’s mis-aligned bones—shapes every tactical move of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early (soft light gathered, no fire) and held to the final “gentler way to shine.” Orientation anchored inside 120 words (“In the serpentine grotto… I lay out…”). Closure achieves Charged Poise: the cloth opens, options re-weighted, sky “bowed low” with undeniable conceptual cost—light without burn now belongs to the children. Persistent constraint (fear of fire) shapes every polishing move.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: viral confession → site abandonment → Eli’s invitation → joint planting, each step tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: their shared kneeling in moss forecloses retreat to anonymity while promising slow growth; cost is legible in her soaked jeans and public exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shoreline image reweights the rule-set—ending as meeting-place, not verdict—with felt cost (he must now write the arrivals he dodged). Causal lens holds: because the narrator confronts him with deleted futures, therefore he accepts the shoreline. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 6 (“night…fogbound streets…rain”). One sentence could be crisper on cost, else 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared breath and blossoms reconfigure the village’s future without forcing cruelty, and the copper bowl’s spilled memories make the conceptual cost legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of song, root, blossom—cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is clean: gate, arbor, dawn anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity. One soft spot: the elders’ undefined “alignment” is a deliberate mystery that pays off in communal breath rather than plot cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the map hovers, the case snaps shut, the alchemist stands in moving stillness—cost paid, path foreclosed. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each star-drop thickens the pattern until the twigs self-seal; no outline sequencing. Orientation lands by line 5 (“subarctic crater”) and the disorientation of frozen time is taught early, paid off in the final breath-held sky. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final silence feels “crowded, softly luminous,” reconfiguring the city’s future access to wonder. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mirror adjustment and whispered question thickens the echo-density until the timer’s wheel becomes a prism that reweights memory itself. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“spiral stairs… marble cavern”). Cost is unmistakable: the locksmith forfeits immediate auditory harvest for a fragile, angle-dependent archive—he “closed the case” knowing its access is now oblique forever.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the protagonist’s fear is reweighted into the fractal dance, cost legible in “one more note in the shingled hush.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each burden’s translation tightens the pattern until her own dread is assimilated. Orientation is taught early (“bronze grotto under starlight” by line 2) and pays off in the mirrored basin; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the grotto will forget, and she must keep returning—this price shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: each beat = because/therefore (because the lion refused, Luca died; therefore she fled; because the blank is “forgiving,” she dares to cut). Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the first carve opens the wood, foreclosing the safer eternity of the uncarved pause—this is the “something useful” that will now sit beside her “like a tool, not a wound.” Anchors clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Accumulated rain/ash/skylight motifs reweight at the exact beat the knife scores, making the cost legible and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost, now crowded with faint overlapping selves, reweights the premise—borrowed lives cannot fill the absence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of echo-objects increases until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is taught early (“after the carousel halts”) and pays off in the slowing music memory. The causal chain is interior but legible: hoarded fragments → ghostly confrontation → forfeiture of self-outline. Cost is on-page: “they weigh more than I can bear, and less than I once believed.”

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rerouted graywater system stands as a living diagram of redirected human intent; the sextant’s reprise reweights navigation from celestial to terrestrial, with conceptual cost—she can’t summon rockets, only trickles. Causal chain holds: sextant find → plumbing map → reroute → dawn nod. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 8. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “flows” taught early and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain-light, petrichor, and layered clock-ticks accrete until the single gear-choke tightens stakes; protagonist’s coaxing becomes the decisive micro-act that reweights meaning. Closure is Earned Stasis—he returns to ledger with warm weight of new design idea beside ribs—cost felt in the irrevocable acceptance of bearing hours while secretly resurrecting dream. Orientation locked by word 30; no lens ambiguity. Final image crystallizes rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s lantern-lit quiver reweights time itself from hidden to undeniable, forcing the world into “new and dangerous honesty.” Causality holds—every beat from canal walk to surfacing is because/therefore linkage under a Causal lens. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and paid off when the lantern reflection swallows our mirrored selves. Cost is legible in the final sentence: the quiet is “fragile,” the tilt palpable, the price ongoing exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each knot-read thickens texture until the lantern-lit fulgurite reframes the rope into legible memory. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-cast when Eli realizes seeds and cords are co-equal archives—cost felt in the whitening dock and the winter stillness he now must tend.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the garden tour reframes absence as subterranean continuation, with the phrase “nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern” delivering undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: parcel thread → meeting → co-walk → re-vision of vanishing. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated naming of grief-sites thickens emotional density until the final re-weighting. Orientation is swift—harbor / palace / dusk line 1–50—and space remains coherent throughout the spiral walk.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: egg discovery → memory → refusal → vigil; each beat tightens options under a single lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the redirected sunlight and “crack of a new dawn” reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost—his throne, his safety, the world’s logic. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image; persistent constraint (palace/industry) still looms.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she hears the boy, therefore she turns her back on the fire; because she gives the coin, therefore the curse is communal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her father’s coin now tied to the boy’s jar—cost legible in the surrender of her final keepsake. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the fire crew’s arrival is slightly convenient, but the emotional cost has already landed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the instant Lira trades her skepticism for the city’s memories, the rule-set flips—fountains roar, citizens stagger under returned time—and the cost is her newly “painfully luminous” innocence. Causal chain holds: each breadcrumb-anomaly is both because/therefore linkage and accumulative pattern that funnels to the glass box. Lens stays accumulative/textural; the shatter is the single cadence shift that reweights everything with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last image of the caretaker “pruning the cosmos, tender and troubled” reweights the premise—exile is no longer punishment but ongoing, imperfect repair. Cost is legible in the soot-stained echo of grandmother’s fingers and the gear’s teeth still biting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies through repeated petal-fall cycles until the final crystallization. No causal cheats; the pattern taught in the first 25% pays off in the final reprise of “falling petals and humming gears.”

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon-map reveals the village’s shared ache, cost felt in the spent spool and rising butterflies. Accumulative lens holds—each grave adds density—though the causality of “why butterflies stay longer” is asserted, not shown. Orientation is swift; greenhouse, dusk, and migration arrive within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: the pendulum’s arrested beat becomes the pattern that reweights guilt into responsibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—time resumes after the covenant—cost is the scorch of insight (“it scorched, searing through my chest”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the pause lengthens until “the air itself felt hinged.”

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the night exhales only after he palms the rewoven border and accepts perpetual caretaking. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (chess clock, sovereign case, tapestry strip) layers density until pattern reweights identity with undeniable cost. Orientation is swift: cemetery/silo/starlight anchors arrive by line 10; no disorientation serves the payoff. Causality holds: strip answers clock, climb answers tug, knowledge answers pattern; no convenient amnesia or teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the snows advance farther, therefore Elian must invent leap-frog roads; because he refuses to bury villagers, therefore he bends policy not breaks it. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: ink now commits the kingdom to a adaptive, non-sacrifice future—cost is the irrevocable stroke and the king’s future wrath if it fails. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by sentence three. Persistent constraint (third-year thaw pulse) shapes the final tactic and is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the pirate signal clarifies, therefore Lina writes, therefore dust-memory becomes legible, therefore the boy arrives—each step narrows options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she stays, keeps writing, accepts the danger; cost is the now-visible shimmer on the boy—proof the tactic works and the gamble is real. Orientation anchors by line 3; no debt. One soft reset: “ash still drifted” after libraries burned reads as scenic stasis, not causal change, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens: each ash line visibly deepens the gallery’s spatial compression toward the titular vanishing point, reweighting the stake “safety is drawable only in charcoal that will burn.” The final scatter is a Conceptual Repricing: the floor becomes an exitless horizon, cost felt as shoe-gray smudges on the audience. Orientation is taught by word 70; no causality breaks; closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—no one pretends they are safe. 9+ gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each paragraph thickens the pattern of drowned memory versus living metal, tightening toward the final image of the silent cog as charged poise. Orientation is fixed by line 5; the Orientation Test is waived because the later payoff reweights the premise. Closure lands cleanly—the chronometer’s dumb metal re-prices the Council’s sterile hope with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal break, no teleport props; the only minor slip is a mid-story reflective block that slightly stalls momentum before the final intensifier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tentative chord between former enemies reconfigures what voices can now attempt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each rehearsal adds density until the final silence after the chord makes the cost audible. Causality is intact: because they subtracted noise week after week, space for a shared note exists. The price—no guarantee beyond that suspended moment—is legible in the lamp-lit hush.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse breathes again, the city still drowned, cost felt in the lingering glow of stubborn refusal. Causal chain—seed → synaptic re-wiring → pruning → emergent light—tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marla’s spoken condition—“only if it remembers to be astonished”—reweights the city’s power-grid rules and ignites the tower, visible cost on the page. Causal chain holds: because she cannot lie, the boy seeks her; because she speaks, the hive reboots; because she accepts perpetual secrecy, the bridge reopens under her private tariff. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (toll booth, post-blackout night, boy approaching). No lens ambiguity; the story tracks “because/therefore” under causal drive to the final flare.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a CR: the final image—“Maybe every scuff…was the structure trying…to say I am still here”—reprices Eli’s premise that only he notices creeping normality; the house, not Eli, may have been the observer. The cost is conceptual and visceral: he forfeits cognitive sovereignty and now shares ontological breathing space with the dwelling. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies via sensory minutiae until the dropped shard triggers a cadence shift at the bed-move. Orientation anchors (who: Eli; where: crooked bay house; when: spring arrival) land within first 120 words; no ambiguity or disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: secret spoken → garden awakens → statue must fracture city → recruits diver → collapse engineered. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“underwater city garden clung to a collapsed avenue”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ceiling rupture lets sea and daylight swap places, cost paid in the statue’s deeper embedment—visible on-page. Minor drag: the rulers’ back-story is delivered in one dense paragraph; still inside BRR limit, but slightly dilutes immediacy before the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The staircase’s infinite twist is anchored immediately; orientation is clear by line 3. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each landing’s hairline asymmetry and dice roll thickens the pattern until the crack reveals the parallel self. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crack seals, the other Arin vanishes, and the cost is the legible forever-gap; the notebook proofs never need to “work” because the engine he actually builds is the relentless present-tense walk. The only causal fuzz is the off-stage doorway exit, but the lens holds and the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nurse’s open palms, the courier’s softening pedal, the balcony man’s swallowed anger—each a visible, felt re-pricing of urban hostility. Causal linkage is lyric but traceable: invisible brush-strokes → moonlit diffusion → retrieved memories → quiet city; no teleporting props or explanatory dump. Accumulated textual density (saffron quiet, breath-colored bristles) reweights the stake from lone experiment to communal hush. The final image of “the city almost gentle” crystallizes options: she could stop, yet keeps painting, cost acknowledged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the narrator’s choice to stay reconfigures options under an Accumulative/Textural lens, charged by the emerald lens image and the bread-letter ritual; cost is felt in the phrase “which of us history would spare.” Causality holds; one minor orientation lag (who/where fully anchored ~140 words) is waived because mist-delay pays off atmospherically.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lattice holds: every stair-step, sigil, and mechanical inversion flows “because/therefore” toward the yoyo-cast that re-tunes the hunger stone. Orientation is anchored by word 80; the backward door-knob turn teaches the counter-rule early. Closure is a Decisive Change: the lighthouse trembles, futures unspool, and the price is the audible scream of string against stone—felt, not abstract. No teleporting props; the yoyo’s inner shard is set up, paid off, and visibly alters the world.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each mirror corridor beat is a because/therefore consequence of touching the clasp, culminating in the decisive change on the pier where confession reclaims his heartbeat and reconfigures the photo. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are retaught at every mirror shard; disorientation is intentional and paid off when the pier loop shatters. Closure carries visible cost: the clasp leaves the boy’s hands, the photo warms, and “darkness waits patient without hunger”—a conceptual repricing that forecloses easy resurrection. Minor loop: “lingering luminance” phrase repeats four times in 700 words without escalation of meaning, a hairline drag.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each strike layers resonance until the orchard’s physical balance and future paths audibly shift. Closure is a Charged Poise—Aera’s leeward smile—where cost is felt in the still-ringing deck and the tomorrow already humming. One causal micro-turn (shift casks starboard) converts acoustic knowledge into physical salvation, tightening stakes without causal gaps. Orientation is secure by line 5; driftwood circle, blue hour, tide-prophet role are anchor enough.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a legible Charged Poise: the whistle’s alien note lands on the page and the colossal environment answers, reconfiguring Keth’s options and the city’s drift. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural logic—each shell he reads adds density until pattern-break forces the final sounding. The cost is the irrevocable exposure of his complicity and the unleashing of an unknown course; no causal break, no soft reset. Persistent constraint: the rusted gate stays closed, so any future voyage will be on turtle-back, not ships.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Elias created the king, therefore the publisher can weaponize it; because they do, therefore he must risk destroying his own myth. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“night vision” reweights the entire moral frame of the franchise with undeniable social cost. Persistent constraint: the illuminated T, once token of authorship, becomes evidence in the threatened exposé—cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pavilion sinks while her hidden archive “breathes,” reweighting the city’s amnesia with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: each note placed = one concrete because/therefore that narrows her future complicity. Time-anchor (drawbridge rising) appears in line 1; space and POV remain lucid. No lens ambiguity—accumulative pattern of sealed absences tightens to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens is clear: blackout → stillness → Mara’s dawning recognition of curated gaps → deliberate rupture of the hidden folio → decision to act. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 50 words and payoff is the blackout’s velvet silence that enables her theft of truth. Closure is a decisive conceptual change: the library’s official history is now irreparably undermined inside her; cost is the audible hush of complicity she now carries. One micro-turn—stamp colder—tightens rather than reverses, satisfying the single-turn allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica rafters crowded with glowing cranes reweights every prior lantern and dream, and the cost—Liora’s flayed heart and the swallowed scream—is legible in the final image. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of thinning, polishing, folding tightens until the cadence shift at the basilica door. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the illegal dream trade purchases her altitude, a price that shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mosaic of shards is taught by 25% and resolves to a clean Conceptual Repricing: the vortex over the village reweights “unused potential” from abstract to stolen lives. The causality chain (observe anomaly → geode ache → model reroute) lands with undeniable cost on the page. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome’s starlight physically fills the chip’s absences, reconfiguring belonging from territory to pattern. Cost is legible—the chip’s glow is a visible price—under an Accumulative lens (density of star-tones) that holds without contradiction. The only hairline slip is the late articulation of “frequency of belonging,” which briefly risks thematic echo, but the final image reweights prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: he gathers the fork-marked driftwood, foreclosing the path of continued erasure while crystallizing the new, risky path of decoding. Cost is legible—“I will return to my trade” implies forfeiting the comfort of ignorance and the income of comforting lies. Causal lens holds throughout: because he recognizes the fork emblem, therefore he reframes his vocation. The note “Ask the shore” acts as telegraphing that pays off; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the untethered lantern carries conceptual repricing—he cuts literal light to signal he will not trade justice for blood. Causal chain holds: because he once chose blood (father died), therefore he now chooses the spy, the drawer-pull question finally answered. Lens is causal throughout; each beat tightens options until only one ethical corridor remains. Mist, moon, and parapet stay spatially coherent; orientation anchor (“storm-worn parapet”) appears by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass thumps as metronome while he paddles toward an uncertain shore, reweighting the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causal chain holds: Lena’s text → fog-bound drift → compass failure → barnacle insight → turn back. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of poles & compass reprises tighten meaningfully. Cost is legible in the final image—“at least I was paddling toward them”—foreclosing surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the protagonist stands mid-lake, bearing the city’s excised guilt in visible bioluminescent ripples—an undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because he mapped, followed, and cut the weld, he now must host what the city refused. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each spice grain, the fortune slip, and the name spoken are “because” triggers that culminate in the narrator’s arboreal transformation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lovers inhabit death together, moonlight in every petal, cost paid by his unmaking. Orientation anchors arrive by line 4; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip: “three years” dead is stated but not woven into any beat before the summoning.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver line brightens and the glade dissolves into a mist-bridge of accumulated omissions, making the cost of lost time undeniable. Causal chain holds—because he confronts the cards’ images he therefore sees the vortex of skipped moments and reorients. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cloud/altar/memento layers increases density until the cadence shift (bridge of mist) reweights stakes. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and payoff justifies any lyric delay.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the star dies, the Tear flares white, the sealed probability door audibly yields—cost is the extinction of the species that made the key. Accumulative lens holds: each immersion thickens the grief-density until the pattern ruptures. Orientation is swift; orbital decay and photo-salt cues anchor who/where within 60 words. One causal wobble: “architectural denial” is asserted but never shown as a physical constraint the ship must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lava halts short, camps saved, but Niko’s “texture of transformation” is now literal pumice scraped heart—felt cost is on-page. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each quietly orchestrated detour layers pattern until the final sideways reroute of an entire population. Causality holds because every step is Niko’s agency (handing jars, mapping veins, running ridges) and the price is his soles and mythic anonymity. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3, eclipse + comet taught as clock.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ambiguous-at-start blackout is taught as opportunity by line 6; orientation anchors (who=Iri, where=western gate tower, when=twilight blackout) land by ~80 words, well inside limit. Causal chain holds: flickering beacon → unguarded moment → sundial cipher → rod insertion → lock amnesia; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s security logic flips, felt cost in the final image—“locks forgot which side was inside.” No teleporting props or causality breaks; sundial cipher payoff justifies early elision.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: friction’s return reweights the premise—motion is debt, not freedom. Causal linkage holds: each stone sequence is a because/therefore step toward re-imposing tax. The final image—aurora drying like ink on proof—makes the social cost undeniable. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor by line 3 and serve the final lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of bruise/ionospheric scars intensifies toward Charged Poise. Timer wound at start → narrowing hour → final auroral map: cadence shift reweights silence as measurable phenomenon. Closure image (“air rarefied, sharp and clear as truth”) crystallizes options with conceptual cost. No causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sundial’s redirected beam, the drawn blade, and the tin’s exposed spiral reconfigure the atrium into a dueling ground where tomorrow’s ownership will be routed, not debated. Causal chain—lateness → reopen tin → notice spiral → angle sundial → invite duel—tightens options with visible cost: Darius risks his neutral-repairer identity. Lens is Causal; every because/therefore linkage narrows possibility up to the final image. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the patrol withdraws, the tin is lifted, the fracture reopens toward light—cost felt in the swallowed breath under the officer’s boot. Causal chain holds: because they archive poems, because the roof is gone, because the city wants silence, they hide the tin; therefore the night can resume. The orientation gate is waived: disorientation (who, where, when withheld until paragraph 3) is taught early and paid off when the same rusted stacks become the site of risk. One ellipsis: how the tin’s manifestos actually reach sleepless citizens is implied not shown, but the gap is compressed by lyric pattern, not causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The film-reel staircase is a taught pattern that pays off: every hidden frame is a doorway, the arbor is the inevitable destination, and the broken clock’s single tick is the on-page cost that reconfigures their options. Causal linkage holds—because Leon slows the reel, therefore he finds the stair; because he steps in, the arbor clocks tremble. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final “off-beat encore” crystallizes their refusal to choose closure, with the lost foreverness of the station world felt in the image of chrome-blue sky inviting night.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream reweights the seed from sacred anchor to possible relic of exile, forcing Kael to accept a vaster, less certain memory. Cost is legible in the final image—“luminous doubt pool[ing] in his chest”—and the monsoon’s early arrival externalizes the irreversible shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated omens, dialects, spiral shells, and goat stares tighten the pattern until the dream reframes the whole texture. One minor scaffold: “simple in words and complicated in practice” is abstract paraphrase, but it occurs early and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, compass click, violet light) tightens the same stake—can regret reach across severance? Closure is a Charged Poise: the lace flag lifts, ghost ships coalesce, options reconfigure without guaranteeing reunion, cost paid in lifelong uncertainty. Orientation anchored by 50 words; no teleporting props. One causal micro-turn—compass locking on grove—propels the final beat. Meets 9+ quick test.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density intensifying via recurring images (lanterns, sparks, breath) that culminate in a final image of release. Cost is legible: Arun forfeits containment for connection, and the boy’s softened posture shows shared burden lifted. Every beat folds into the next like light in the camera obscura.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time is not linear but a “trembling lattice,” and the self is not separate from the maze. Cost is legible in the fraying outline, the merging of histories, the irreversible surrender of individuality. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring images (halo, photos, bridges), culminating in a cadence shift at disintegration. Every structural beat tightens toward this revelation without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s poised intervention crystallizes options—vault saved or destroyed—with cost felt in every rasping chain-link and detonation beyond the wall. The Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (“cough,” “clip his wrist,” “decode him”) chains to the next because/therefore.

    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s auroral wounds reweight censorship from political act to cosmic scar, with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the storm, timer, and telescope build density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3. The one-hour constraint tightens pressure without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the overture begins, light/steel/water rearrange, and Darius draws his blade—not to fight, but to navigate. Cost is legible in his mechanical arm’s click, the storm-smell amid blue sky, the lateness as thesis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (sundial, tin, brook), culminating in a cadence shift that reweights “waiting” into active orchestration. Every element pays off without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patrol’s intrusion crystallizes options (hide or resist), and the floorboard “swell[ing] slightly as if breathing” makes the cost—ongoing vulnerability—visceral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (molting, rust, false bottoms) until the moonlit climax reweights them. Orientation anchors instantly (“rusted library under stars”), and the single-scene shard fits 600–800w defaults. Cost is legible in the tin’s concealment and the archivist persona’s emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor’s rules are reweighted when Leon’s arrival triggers new pathways, and their joint decision crystallizes options without tidy resolution. Causality is tight under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative (textural density of clocks/compasses/film) fused with Causal (Leon’s actions directly activate the staircase, move the clock). Cost is legible in Mara’s “single unplayed song” aging and the compass snapping toward an “unseen key”—a future demanding improvisation over safety. The broken clock’s tremor at midnight earns the climax without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via patterned anomalies (children speaking old dialects, shell maps, goats staring seaward) until the dream-revelation reweights the entire premise. Closure is Charged Poise—Kael hasn’t decided, but options are legible, stakes crystallized, cost felt (“to deny this dream would keep the island small and sure”). Orientation is immediate (“far edge of the archipelago,” “ancient ridge”), and the monsoon clock tightens causality without mechanical ticking. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: luminous doubt as rain before it falls.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the apology exists wordlessly, the compass redirects, ghost ships gather—options reconfigure without resolution, yet the cost (permanent separation or delayed reunion) is palpable in “a space had opened that her forgiveness might one day cross.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via lace, compass, and tide motifs until the cadence shift at the grove crystallizes meaning. Anchors are clear by line 30; no causality breaks.
