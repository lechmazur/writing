  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure—a butterfly materializing from dust—lands as a symbolic flourish rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. No before/after is traceable in Elara's options or stance; she observes beauty emerge but makes no choice that forecloses a path. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens through repeated dust-pattern experiments, yet the ending skips escalation and delivers a convenient resolution that the protagonist does not earn through agency. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalties there, but the lens remains decorative rather than pressure-building.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early enough. The closure unit—Elara discovering the ledger's full truth and her apprentice's location—lands on the page, but the cost remains vague ("renewed determination" and future plans rather than a present forfeiture or stance shift). The because/therefore chain is present (ledger → frost patterns → caches → grotto → truth) but the final beat summarizes consequence ("she would use...") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path now.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's attempts layer (tuning fork, heat-mapping device, working with Kael) until the final dawn moment reweights silence from absence to canvas. Orientation is present (conservatory, post-Noise world, Elara's role) by the opening paragraphs. The closure—accepting silence as language rather than emptiness—lands on the page with felt cost (abandoning the search for literal sound), and the lens holds. One tightening (Kael's pattern discovery) deepens the stake. The pattern discovery feels somewhat convenient, arriving late to solve the problem it did not help create, which limits the causal inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The closure unit—lens assembled, signal sent, water parts—lands on the page but the cost is conceptual only; Elias's personal forfeit or trade-off is not legible. The central reversal (lens is incomplete → fragments found → signal sent) proceeds in and-then sequencing with minimal because/therefore linkage. The mysterious package inciting incident and the climactic assembly feel like checklist beats rather than motivated pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately and follows a causal progression: midnight runs → discovery → gathering → community commitment. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (community shifts from hollowed survivors to active participants), but the cost remains abstract—no specific path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative coloring; the gathering functions as a turn, but the final image ("she felt a peace") tells rather than showing the reweighted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sparks, blossoms, memory fragments, and the pendant toward a final tableau. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara places the pendant and receives "healing" and "newfound life" without forfeiting a live option or paying a price that the reader can point to on the page. The "unused love was stored within her" realization is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized choice that narrows her world.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting the test. The piece attempts an accumulative/textural lens but the closure lacks visible cost: Elara places the fragment, experiences a vision, and emerges with restored memories and a changed maze—pure gain with no forfeiture, renunciation, or price paid. The fragment's disintegration removes the object but doesn't foreclose a path or exact a felt consequence. The ending's "she had discovered herself" is an abstract claim disconnected from on-page pressure, failing to land a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (carnival, chained figure, seed vault goal). The closure unit—escaping with seeds, chains falling away—lands on the page, but the cost is erased rather than felt: "as if they had never been there" undercuts forfeiture. The arrow-to-piano-bench puzzle is set up and paid off, but the wall's collapse and enemies' pursuit function as interchangeable time pressure without altering tactics or forcing a visible trade-off at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (color-hum motif, ashen forge as repository), but the closure relies on a summarized realization ("understood… a reminder") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing in principle, but cost is asserted ("even in shattering, there is beauty") not shown through a forfeited option or altered tactic. One tightening occurs (absence collection → forge imprint), yet the causal link between "collecting absences" and the final insight remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens inferred as Causal with situational elements. Orientation anchors by ~60 words (emerald station, Lira, tonight). The closure unit—Lira accepting the jar and walking away with "purpose"—lacks visible cost; she gains the object without forfeit or friction. The flower-arrangement trap is introduced and disarmed in two paragraphs with no prior setup, reading as convenient rather than earned. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara's appearance dissolves conflict rather than escalating it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clear (who, where, when established early), and the piece follows a single POV in one location. However, no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page. Elara begins crafting spheres and ends having crafted them; the "turning point" is declared in narration ("a symbolic gesture") rather than dramatized with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—only completion of the task is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lands as assertion: mirrors crack into light without legible cost or tactical consequence. Causality is thin—the seashell "guides" and "glows" without established rules, the key appears conveniently in a hidden compartment, and the final voice delivers the thesis rather than letting image do the work. The Orientation Test passes (library, Elara, post-discovery timeframe by ~80 words), but escalation reads as spatial relay (shelf→cast→door→mirrors) rather than because/therefore pressure. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (decrypt notes→find key) and Accumulative/Textural (symbolic objects) without cohering at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece orients (fort, oracle, booklet) by the first paragraph. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The oracle begins wanting to map endless night, performs ritual storytelling, and ends still wanting the same thing with "work far from over"—a deferral rather than closure. The star's vanishing is atmospheric but does not alter options or impose felt cost. Under an Accumulative lens the final image would need to reweight the stake; it does not.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (newfound clarity, purposeful steps) but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option. The looped-timeline mechanism is introduced and visualized in paragraph four but functions as delivered montage rather than pressure that Unit-7 navigates with agency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (music weaving fragments into narrative), yet the final reweighting lacks the sharp cadence shift or pattern break that would charge the ending image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic objects (ticket, lens, doodles, crystals) meant to charge the closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (mistrust thaws) but the decisive shift occurs through Kian's smile and acceptance without on-page resistance or felt cost—he simply agrees, making the "thaw" feel asserted rather than earned. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence clearly shows what Elara or Kian forfeits or what path is foreclosed by their reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors adequately (who, where, when by early paragraphs). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "mended deception" realization arrives through direct explanation rather than image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece needed one decisive intensification or cadence shift that narrows options; instead it loops through marble-polishing across weeks without a visible turn. The "blooming withering" moment is asserted as paradox but not dramatized as pressure that forecloses a choice. Cost-proof test: no on-page sentence shows what Elias loses or relinquishes in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The lever-pull triggers a causal sequence (nexus surge → alarms → system failures → manual override → stabilization), but the climactic reversal lacks visible cost: Elara's second lever adjustment succeeds immediately with "precision," erasing stakes rather than forcing a trade-off. The ending offers a micro turn (responsibility tempers motivation) but the cost remains abstract—"what she had to protect" is stated, not dramatized as a foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a causal lens (Clara finds program → decodes melody → summons ghost → achieves closure) but the final beat dissolves into pure atmosphere without visible cost. The program "fully dissolved" and the ghost "vanished" read as clean resolution rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clear early (flooded opera house, Clara, present moment). The escalation from discovery to humming to connection follows because/therefore logic, but the ending offers emotional satisfaction without foreclosing a path or charging the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the botanical illustration seed → smudge → purposeful distortion builds a pattern that reweights the premise at closure. Orientation anchors (mountain weather station, Elara, post-fever) arrive early and remain stable. However, the closure beat—Elara adding to the smudge and feeling peace—lacks a legible cost; the "transformation" is asserted rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price. The wanderer's lines deliver thematic wisdom but do not narrow Elara's choices on the page, weakening causal linkage under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure—Mara turns the valve, shadows dissolve, weight lifts—lands on the page but the cost is declared rather than dramatized; we see no path foreclosed, no trade-off. The causal chain from discovery to insertion is linear and uncontested, offering no meaningful tightening or deepening under a causal lens. The "ghost shift" setup promises pressure but delivers a single, unopposed action at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure unit is weak: Lira returns to the library with journals she doesn't remember writing, the refuge vanishes, and the final image asserts she "had become the silence" without reweighting prior material through a concrete on-page cost or cadence shift. The journey to the refuge and back reads as a circular reset rather than a reconfiguration, and the visions (library crumbling, river drying, swan disintegrating) do not alter her tactics or options upon return.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Finn's "shift" and the curl's symbolic reweighting), but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt or visible on the page. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the eclipse functions as a charged moment, but causality is loose—Elara's actions (humming, holding the curl) do not meaningfully narrow options or impose a trade-off; the "magic" appears without prior constraint or price. The curl's glow and Finn's transformation feel convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is late: the post-dream world is not anchored until midway through paragraph one; "after the last human dream was dreamt" arrives as exposition rather than a present constraint (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test). The closure—restoring dreams via ritual—lacks visible cost; the golden light and "vibrant symphony" declare success without foreclosing a path or showing what Elara sacrificed. Drive lens reads Causal at setup but shifts to summary告completion without earned causality; the ritual's mechanics are told, not tested. The final image ("the world dreamed again") asserts a change off-page rather than landing a decisive on-page turn with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words (who/where anchor, but "when" and immediate situation remain vague until "clock struck midnight"). The piece reads as a single continuous meditation rather than a scene with causal pressure; no clear inciting incident, reversal, or tightening occurs—Li Wei decides to plan a journey, but the decision lacks on-page friction or cost. The "accidentally brushing against the specs" triggers a declarative epiphany ("surge of clarity") without dramatized consequence or choice that narrows options. Closure is absent: the final paragraph summarizes a future quest rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear early but remain abstract ("dimensional anchor," "vast and enigmatic space") without spatial grounding past ~120 words; apply −0.4. Drive lens: ambiguous through midpoint (accumulative metaphor versus causal mission-plot); by the end the priest's declaration causes the possession to dissolve, suggesting causal intent, but linkage is asserted not dramatized. Closure effect: the possession "recoils" and "dissolves" off-page with no visible cost to the priest — no path foreclosed, no felt price, no resonant reconfiguration. The final silence is described as "different" but the change is told, not shown in a choice or image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: textural density competes with a gestural causal frame, never committing. The Orientation Test fails—who is this writer, why here, why now?—with no anchors by 120 words and no taught pattern that pays off. Closure reads as summary ("the symphony was unlike anything") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The harp activation and final slump are asserted, not causally linked to prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—POV, setting purpose, and temporal frame remain vague past the first 120 words, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The piece signals a causal lens (tablet guides, choices spawn timelines) but undercuts it with procedural-generation language that implies randomness without teaching a coherent pattern. The closure—"embrace the labyrinth"—is asserted as insight without visible cost or a legible before/after change in options; the viaduct simply becomes "whole" again, erasing all prior complexity. No meaningful tightening under pressure occurs; each alternate-self encounter is a tableau that Elara passively observes and then leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara embraces silence rather than escaping it—with felt cost visible in her tears and the discarded needle. However, the causal chain from backward songs to emotional breakthrough is asserted more than dramatized; the "changes—subtle at first" passage summarizes transformation rather than showing specific micro-turns that narrow options or alter knowledge on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by ~80 words, meeting orientation. The closure arrives (accepting a new purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"his life would never be the same" tells the change without showing what he forecloses. The causal chain from message tube to quarantine zone is functional, but the masked figure's exposition resolves the mystery Elias did not help create, undercutting earned discovery. The inferred lens is causal, and it holds, yet the final reconfiguration lacks felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph (Elias, grotto, post-arrival of energy beings). A loose accumulative lens is inferable: the protagonist explores patterns and images that deepen toward a final realization. However, the closure—Elias placing the rope in the alcove and stepping outside with "knowledge that time was not a thing to discover, but a poem to write"—lands as told epiphany rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The mirror's three images offer a conceptual repricing moment, but the consequence remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present but diffuse: "echo-harbor violinist" and the setting details arrive early, yet the stakes remain abstract. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Elara encounters the bowl, plays, speaks, and leaves in a smooth arc without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The closure—realizing "the hush had never been her enemy"—is asserted rather than earned through on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, no decisive cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure unit—Elara completing the emotion craft and walking away—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts the half-truth currency of her trade), but the cost is asserted ("quiet satisfaction") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible consequence. The petal's dissolution shifts the grotto's energy, yet no on-page choice by Elara alters her options or stance in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mistaken envelope seeds a cycle that accretes through letters and culminates in the star-library meeting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the locket "lighter now, as if its purpose had been fulfilled"), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs on the page. The envelope's arrival and Clara's identity as the grandmother's descendant feel engineered rather than causally earned. One meaningful deepening occurs (letters build to meeting), satisfying length requirements, but the final image declares relief without charging prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt: who, where, when land early. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—pressure builds through the shared search, broadening community ties—but closure depends on Echo's off-page validation rather than Lira's on-page agency reweighting prior material. The final arbor moment offers a resonant image, yet the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks a before/after boundary. The hunt for Echo functions as a linking device but does not narrow options or force a renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Mara returns with "lighter" sketchbook and "clearer" mind—a soft reset without foreclosed paths. The pendant's task being "complete" and her ability to "sculpt time" are asserted rather than tested against resistance. Orientation is present by ~120 words. The journey's reversals (gate opening, pool discovery) result from the pendant's magic rather than protagonist agency, and the "giant's nap" timeframe is mentioned but never tightens tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative design layered in; the glass eyes → mosaic patterns → hidden journal sequence provides because/therefore linkage. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Elara's "final breakthrough" is told rather than shown, and the orchard glowing "brighter" offers visual assertion without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The mentor's warning of danger is set up but never pressures her final choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but "dawn" never tightens into a clock that alters tactics. The piece strings together discovery beats (finds fragment, follows pipes, finds more fragments, hears recording) in and-then fashion without because/therefore pressure or a meaningful narrowing of options. The ending declares fulfillment ("uncovered a way to connect") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or visible cost occurs—the dweller returns to the crawl space with fragments "ready to share" in a future the text does not dramatize. Lens reads as intended-Causal but executes as summary-Accumulative without density increase or cadence shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with storm-mirroring-inner-turbulence and the leaf as recurring motif. Orientation anchors (nursery owner, storm season, mossy trellis) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she releases control, the nursery becomes "a living, breathing entity"), but the cost is abstract—"lighter than she had in years" and the leaf's mysterious dissolution lack concrete consequences that alter tactics or foreclose options. The transformation is told more than shown, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (painter, tidal island, post-water-wars) within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rain trails → ruin discovery → brooch → map → cove exchange → final painting, with the brooch and book functioning as charged objects that reweight Elara's artistic purpose. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes "a keeper of stories, a bridge between worlds"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The exchange with the old woman delivers the thematic payload via convenient encounter rather than protagonist-driven escalation, and "it all made sense now" tells the resolution rather than showing a decisive image or action that makes the before/after legible with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (pilgrim, cave, clairvoyant). The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (guardian/transformation ending), but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains power and understanding with no forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The causal chain is thin: she touches the pearl, merges with the cave, and emerges "transformed" without dramatized resistance or price. The lens wavers between accumulative (crystal imagery) and causal (quest for answers), settling uneasily on neither by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elara's search, discovery of the carved wood, and use of the valve progress logically, culminating in the woman's arrival and Elara's acceptance of her task. Orientation anchors (Elara at Ivory Harbor post-exile, searching for fragments) arrive early. However, closure reads as Charged Poise—Elara raises the valve again, feeling purpose—but the cost is abstract ("absences… waiting to be filled") rather than a visible forfeiture or shift in options. The woman's dissolution and Elara's renewed commitment offer thematic weight but lack the sharp before/after legibility and felt price that would push this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchor solidifies only after ~200 words of workspace description and object focus. The drive lens reads Situational (external mystery pressure forces stance), but causality is weak—arrows appear without prior setup, the fortress gates open passively when she raises the punch, and the final dissolution happens to her rather than through her agency. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("something within her had shifted"), but the cost is told, not shown; no on-page forfeiture or visible price appears in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dreaming, climbing, visions accrue toward a realization), but the closure is told rather than shown: "she knew its magic would remain within her" summarizes the change without an on-page image that reweights prior material with cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (village, shore, cottage anchored by ~80 words). Causality is weak—tile glows, Elara transcribes, tower amplifies, visions appear—without protagonist decisions narrowing options. The final paragraph states theme and resolution rather than landing a decisive image, violating the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The story follows a causal arc: boredom → discovery → experiment → shatter → transformation. However, the closure unit—"the void within him had not been filled, but it had changed, transformed into something else—a spark of purpose"—is told rather than shown, and no on-page cost is legible in the final image. The drive lens reads as Causal, but the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, weakening closure proof.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. A single meaningful tightening occurs when Clara voices her refusal and her father softens, shifting their dynamic. However, the closure—Clara's realization that the fair trade is internal—is told in summary ("Clara realized") rather than shown through a decisive image or action with on-page cost; the cost (leaving schemes behind) is implied but not felt in the final beat. The drive lens reads as Causal with an attempted Conceptual Repricing, but the ending defaults to explanation rather than resonant image, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the hum intensifies and yields a memory-fragment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or felt cost lands on the page; Elara simply "closes her notepad" and descends satisfied. The ending registers as mood completion, not closure with visible price. The story teaches a pattern of listening/charting but does not pay it off with a reconfiguration that alters options or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but "weeks ago" and the tidal rhythm create temporal vagueness that persists past 120 words without paying off at closure (−0.3). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a thematic realization. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the insight "the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself," but this reweighting is asserted rather than demonstrated through a visible cost or altered tactic on the page. The container discovery (archive of erased histories) introduces new information but doesn't narrow options or force a sacrifice; the wanderer simply continues.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the cello's hum and the shell's glow layer toward a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the first paragraph. The closure moment—Mara's realization and departure—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding rather than solving the riddle), but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("courage to embrace the ephemeral") rather than felt or visible on the page. No tightening or deepening alters her tactics; she plays, understands, and leaves without a single option foreclosed or a single prior expectation overturned by dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story presents a Causal lens but the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Lira places the stone, the festival becomes "a rallying cry," and the community's resolve is "sealed" through summary rather than a decisive action or renunciation that forecloses a path. The Cost Proof Test fails—no sentence in the ending beat makes a felt price legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, so no penalty applies there, but the climax is told rather than dramatized, and the final paragraph ("their fight was far from over… something brighter") offers aspirational summary instead of a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening). The chemical message provides a timed reversal, and the closure image—photographing the site at dawn—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she outlasts the dawn as commanded, honoring legacy against erasure). Cost is felt but oblique: the heavy heart and clutched grain signal loss, yet no concrete tactical forfeiture or relational price lands on the page. One meaningful deepening (message discovery) tightens the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the depot's maiden-voyage event runs parallel to the repair, and closure arrives as a thematic echo rather than a causal turn. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's work as "an anchor of its own"), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters her stance. The closure unit feels asserted in the final paragraph rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph without penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces pursuit), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on the page. The falcon's return and the condensation pattern function as coincidental clues rather than choices that narrow options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-driven discovery), held consistently, but the final image ("her new journey") resets rather than reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors are present early, so no penalty applies. However, no on-page closure unit exists—the story summarizes weeks of routine without a decisive change, choice, or moment where Elias forecloses a path with visible cost. The bell chiming at the end is a passive validation rather than a reconfiguration driven by Elias's agency; the "balance restored" is asserted, not dramatized. Lens ambiguity: the piece oscillates between causal promise (tuning fork, rhythm) and lyric accumulation without teaching a pattern or landing either cleanly. Cost is absent; the town awakens through described summary, not pressured action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn Maya is trapped only after introductory description, and "limited oxygen" appears once then vanishes as a constraint. The closure unit—Maya's shift from survival to discovery—lacks visible cost; the distress signal becomes "unnecessary" off-page, and her safe return is summarized without obstacle. Causality is thin: the vial "touches memories" through passive reception, the temple walls shift by themselves, and no protagonist choice meaningfully narrows options or changes knowledge in a way that forecloses a path. Under an attempted Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is missing at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader learns Elias is a prisoner only obliquely, and his actual situation (alone? guarded? why imprisoned?) remains vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit—Elias deciding to "tell his story"—occurs off-page as declaration rather than on-page action with cost; no before/after state is legible. Causality is weak: the journal conveniently appears, the hush mechanism is told rather than tested, and the ending replaces scene pressure with thematic summary ("He was Elias, the boy who chased truth").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" (ghost bride's identity, her binding event) and "when" (the timeframe's pressure) remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in ambition (gothic atmosphere, recurring bead, pattern of sorrow), but no decisive tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible cost. The ending—stepping into endless night with "a glimmer of hope"—offers mood rather than closure; no path is foreclosed, no conceptual price made legible. Closure form is absent, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "poetic wharf weaver" and "storybook illustration plate" appear immediately but remain opaque past 120 words; the labyrinth's purpose and the tide-pool desolation are asserted rather than dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—leaving the reader unable to trace how one beat enables the next. Closure registers as summary ("her task complete") without a visible, on-page cost or a decisive shift in options. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies; Q3 is capped at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (catacomb orchard, diaspora returnee, excavation task). However, no meaningful causal linkage drives the discovery—Elara wanders until the land "guides" her, then stumbles upon the hollow without prior agency narrowing options. The closure (finding belonging via the mural) lands as told resolution rather than a decisive change with visible cost; the faith is restored by discovery alone, not by a choice that forecloses a path. Drive lens reads Situational-leaning but the stance crystallization at closure is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early (golden arcade, dawn, Lyra). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the chalk-to-letter progression, but the closure lacks felt cost—Lyra simply acquires the letter and smiles, leaving no visible path foreclosed or stakes reconfigured. The ending's "futuristic nostalgia" and children's chalk remain decorative rather than reweighting prior pressure. No meaningful tightening narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: mentor vanished, flame pulses, Lira arrives with urgent intel, then collaborative work to "complete" the chart. Orientation anchors (cobalt observatory, autumn evening, Elara alone) land early. However, the closure—chart complete, "purpose found"—is asserted rather than shown as a decisive change with on-page cost; the conspiracy remains offstage, and "unraveling the truth, one stitch at a time" reads as thematic summary, not a reconfigured situation. The flame's pulsing and constellation shifts hint at mystical mechanics but never constrain a choice or force a trade-off that the ending then pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is functional (medium, mangrove, shard) but the drive lens remains ambiguous—moments gesture toward causal (shard guides her), accumulative (singing spirits), and situational (apology timeframe) without committing. The closure unit (reading her own letter, feeling whole) lands as Decisive Change but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no tactic was altered, no relationship state changed on the page, and "no longer a burden" tells the repricing instead of demonstrating it. The shard's mechanics shift without clear rules (it "heals" yet functions as a key, then a map-maker).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (atrium, Elara, twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the coral fragment glows, notes unknot in stages, mist swirls, and the ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration ("the ocean still sings" as Charged Poise). However, the cost at closure is asserted rather than demonstrated—stepping into the night with "quiet determination" does not foreclose a visible option or show a felt price. One meaningful deepening occurs (child's plea → map → promise), meeting the minimum for this length, but the closure image lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (Lira, ruined orchard, fog), so no penalty. Closure reads as Decisive Change (joy returns) but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "her steps lighter" tells the shift without showing what path she foreclosed. The daydream framing ("within the fold of a daydream," "folded back into reality") is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or shapes the ending image, leaving lens ambiguity—Causal or Accumulative?—unresolved at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: coin discovery → mural brightening → figures emerge → exchange offered → humming transformation. However, the closure hinges on an instructed epiphany rather than protagonist-driven reversal; Elara's choice to hum is prompted externally, weakening agency at the decisive moment. Cost is asserted ("by exchanging it for curiosity, she had unlocked something far greater") but the on-page price—what concrete path or belief she foreclosed—remains abstract. One meaningful tightening is present (the offer to "exchange certainty for curiosity"), but it arrives via dialogue rather than situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when clarifies only after the greenhouse description, past the 120-word mark without taught pattern. The dominant stake—protect the Lexicon—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options; Elias deciphers symbols off-page, then is handed coordinates by Krane with no friction. The ending announces "tonight, they would stand together" without on-page cost, stakes reconfiguration, or a decisive change—only a declaration of future intent. No closure unit (DC/RR/CR) lands; the story stops rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure event occurs; the ending asserts completion ("The blossom armistice was complete") rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance. The piece summarizes weeks and months in fast-forward without a single causal because/therefore link or escalation beat—time passes, the poet sings, something "shifts" vaguely one night, then she finishes and walks out. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the piece never coalesces into a legible drive lens or delivers cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads accumulative/textural (pattern of echoes, light, and preservation), but no meaningful tightening or cost lands on the page—Elara succeeds without forfeiture, the Vessel glows, the chime shatters without consequence. The ending offers a declarative summary ("their stories alive") rather than a visible or felt reconfiguration. The plot is and-then sequenced (she moves, she finds, she sings, light blooms) with no because/therefore pressure or deepening that changes her stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when by the second paragraph) and follows a causal track: Elara seeks the inkwell to restore trust, makes three promises, writes with it, and Kael appears reconciled. However, the climactic beat—dipping the quill and writing—operates more through assertion ("the ink flowed in patterns she did not consciously create") than through dramatized struggle or cost that narrows options. The ending relies on the inkwell's magic rather than protagonist agency, and Kael's appearance feels summoned rather than earned through interpersonal negotiation. One tightening is present but the cost at closure is more declared than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elias, the ingenious floodgate machinist" in paragraph one, but who summoned him, why he's uniquely suited, and what actual conflict he faces remain vague until late in paragraph two. The closure—Elias presents a compromise plan that both parties accept—occurs entirely off-page ("By dawn, Elias had presented his plan…The scholars nodded; the villagers sighed in relief"). No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the resolution is summarized, not dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous (Causal gestures compete with Accumulative motifs like the chain's poem), and the adhesive analysis delivers information but does not narrow options or alter tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (attic, bookshop, Elara) land early. The story attempts an Accumulative lens: dust-mote mapping seeds early, the letter arrives as a complication, and the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise). However, the closure unit remains tellingly abstract—"she had preserved herself" asserts transformation without showing a visible or felt cost on the page. The letter's arrival and the weeks of renewed mapping compress causality into summary ("Slowly, the songs began to return"), weakening the tightening required even under an accumulative design. Cost is conceptual at best, not legible in a specific action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (terrace), and when (after butterfly effect) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the terrace shifts, memory surfaces, the code appears, and understanding accrues without causal linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara leaves the logbook and gains "quiet clarity"), but the cost—what she forecloses by leaving the book—remains abstract and not visibly priced on the page, weakening the closure band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors WHO (Elara, landscape astrologer), WHERE (underwater research facility), and WHEN (night to sunrise) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through firefly accumulation, facility decay, and alarm threat, culminating in a final dance before escape. Closure is Charged Poise—she joins the dance, then departs with the feather, crystallizing her understanding of belonging as journey rather than destination. Cost is felt (leaving the moment, the facility reclaimed) but the choice to leave was already inevitable when alarms blared; the dance is a micro turn that doesn't foreclose a live alternative, weakening the decisive weight. Causality holds but escalation is more atmospheric than choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, and when land early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with the seed-touching and glass-glowing beats building toward a resonant reconfiguration. However, the closure lacks legible cost—the path "flickers and vanishes" but Lira simply smiles, understanding that "some paths disappear...because they are meant to be rediscovered." This reframes the question without foreclosing an option or paying a felt price on the page; the ending gestures toward Charged Poise but the stakes and their reconfiguration remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, avoiding penalty. However, no meaningful closure unit materializes: Elias performs, bows, leaves—a sequence without decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The "climax" (starlight on bishop) is spectacle witnessed by others, not a turn driven by Elias's choice or renunciation. The ending restates the premise ("orchestrated serendipity") rather than altering it, and no felt or conceptual cost appears on the page to validate closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lira is and what "tide dancer" means arrive late, and the nostalgia ban's mechanics remain abstract. The piece attempts a Situational lens (pressure from the sentinel's arrival) but the closure—sentinel walks away—lacks visible cost or consequence; we do not see what Lira has forfeited or what the verse's survival changes. The turn is unmotivated: why does the sentinel pause and leave? No causal thread earns the reprieve, so closure reads as coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational elements: the mist lifts, Elias experiences clarity, and decides to share insights. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. However, closure operates as a stated intention ("he knew what he had to do") rather than a visible change with felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no option eliminated. The "noctilucent reckoning" moment inside the atrium offers a conceptual shift, but it remains internalized epiphany without on-page consequence that alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early but operates in pure reflection mode with no meaningful escalation or causal turn. The protagonist sits, reflects, and walks away; no option is narrowed, no knowledge changes through on-page event. The "closure" is a realization stated in exposition ("he began to enlighten himself") without a decisive change, renunciation with cost, or image that reweights prior material. Orientation is clean, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal pressure nor accumulative density builds to a legible endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive early, but "across parallel timelines" remains decorative without altering options or stakes. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens initially but never commits: no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost. The closure—Elara realizing hope is to be lived, not calculated—lacks on-page cost; she simply walks away revitalized. The tide erasing patterns is framed as triumph rather than loss, leaving no felt trade-off or foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (ivy passage, waterfall, climate-shifted world) and the lens reads as Causal with mosaic undertones. The closure unit—placing the film strip on the pedestal and receiving the window's validation—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: Echo gains purpose without paying a legible price on the page. The scholar's vanished fate seeds stakes, yet Echo's path to the chamber (map appears clear in firelight, wall gives way) progresses through convenient revelation rather than motivated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early, and the piece builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (mirrors surrender, Elara's heartbeat fades). However, the tightening lacks causal pressure: mirrors resist, she sings louder, they surrender without a pivot in her method or a dramatized trade-off that forecloses options. The "borrowed heartbeat" cost is told in summary ("her own heartbeat now fainter") rather than shown through a choice or visible consequence that alters tactics. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece needed one decisive intensification or pattern break that reweights the stake with on-page cost; the ending reconfigures but the cost remains asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal arc: Elara descends, negotiates across three days, delivers a climactic speech that shifts the leaders, and they sign. However, the key reversal—leaders moving from suspicion to signing—occurs off-page in "that silence, something shifted," which summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive change. Cost is gestured at ("at a cost she was still learning to bear") but remains abstract rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or realization.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean and the closure lands on the page: Elara releases the egg and rain falls. However, the Accumulative lens weakens because no prior beat meaningfully tightens—she walks, finds the spot, places the egg. The cost ("redemption she didn't deserve but couldn't deny") is asserted rather than made visible through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. The thunderstorm's timing feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency or the story's own causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph; the prism sanctuary functions as a spatial goal. However, causality is soft: Elara's success hinges on unexplained intuition rather than prior skill or cost, and the "harvest of echoes" mechanism is never dramatized—threads untangle because the plot requires it, not because her choices narrow options. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (the city awakens, fragments scatter in snow), but the cost is abstract and off-page ("forced to confront the truth of its complacency"); no on-page consequence tests Elara or alters her immediate reality. The lens wobbles between Accumulative (mythic imagery, lyric cadence) and Causal (a task sequence), settling inconclusively.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. Drive lens: leans Accumulative/Textural (dome imagery, stick patterns) but closure execution is weak. The "reversal" from dismantling to rebuilding narratives is told in reflection, not enacted; no on-page decisive change or felt cost occurs—Elias simply decides, arranges puppets, and leaves satisfied. The final image (stepping into morning air with puppets) lacks undeniable pressure or conceptual cost; the "deeper understanding" is asserted, not made legible through action or renunciation. Apply −0.6 for missing on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates imagery (grotto, moth wing, monarch absence, spiral) and modulates cadence from stillness to hum to descent. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara completes the ritual and departs, accepting the transience she celebrates. Cost is conceptual—the structures will fade—but the final image does not reweight prior material or foreclose a dramatized alternative on the page. Orientation is established early (grotto, Elara, present moment). One meaningful deepening: adding the monarch wing to the spiral charges the act slightly, but no reversal narrows options or alters knowledge in a way that reconfigures the opening stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure—Elara finding her name among the forgotten—lacks causal preparation; nothing in her prior regrets or forgiveness arc connects to this specific revelation. The piece accumulates atmospheric description but offers no meaningful tightening or reversal; the rope glows, the melody plays, success arrives without complication. Orientation is adequate (sanctum, Elara, lost-wax caster by ~100 words), but the "after forgiving yourself" timeframe is asserted, not dramatized, leaving the threshold vague. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with one POV. However, no meaningful tightening occurs: Foresight begins deciphering and ends having deciphered, with the wafer seal conveniently glowing and dissolving without prior constraint or cost. The "resonance" explanation lands as told revelation rather than dramatized shift, and no visible price is paid—Foresight sits "at rest" with wonder intact, foreclosing nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, meeting the test. However, the entire arc is summary: Kael hears rumor, finds tile in one beat, deciphers it in the next, and achieves covenant off-page. No on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge through because/therefore linkage. The ending declares purpose and guardianship without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible with felt cost. Closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, avoiding penalty. The dominant stake—convincing Kael to release resentment—is signaled early, but escalation is linear persuasion rather than a causal tightening under the inferred Situational lens. The ending offers a micro turn ("How do I start?") but visible cost is absent; Kael's "burden lifted" reads as relief without foreclosing a path or imposing a price. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) is attempted but the pressure dissipates rather than crystallizes, leaving the final image aspirational rather than reconfigured with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure image—Elara standing at the threshold with boundaries dissolving—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence names what she forfeits or risks by crossing. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural through "synchronized breathing" and fog-thinning imagery, yet the final paragraph's "her work was just beginning" deflates the achieved threshold into setup for an unwritten sequel, undercutting closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The sextant restoration sequence relies on vague causality: "her hands moved without her conscious direction" and "the broken pieces fused together" via mystical automatism rather than motivated action, weakening the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within bounds. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara transforms the vow and finds hope—but the cost is not legible on the page; we're told she "felt hope" and the ribbon glows, yet no specific forfeiture or foreclosed path is visible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (orchard imagery, ribbon as motif, healing through found objects), but the ending summarizes transformation ("She would persist") rather than dramatizing a decisive moment with felt pressure. Causality is loose: the rusted key unlocks a scroll, petals cause a bloom, and the compass points to the ribbon without prior setup or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is clear (astral orchard, Elara cataloging anomalies, pistachio cameo found earlier). The plot follows a causal outline—find object, wander, have realization in bathroom, meet keeper—but the bathroom "breakthrough" is told as summary ("she realized") rather than dramatized, and the woman's arrival resolves the mystery through exposition rather than Elara's choice. The ending offers a stance shift ("felt ready") but no visible cost or foreclosed path; the closure reads as setup for a larger journey rather than a decisive change or charged poise within this window. Drive lens appears Causal but ellipsis between beats lacks motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The causal chain breaks: Elara finds the diary instantly, solves its riddles off-page ("she spent hours"), and the chrono-blossom simply unlocks the door without complication. The guardian's "renegotiation" is summarized in one sentence with no on-page cost or stakes; closure is asserted ("deal struck") rather than dramatized. No visible price forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, ship, fog) arrive quickly. The story follows a quest structure—Elara seeks the garden, follows the glowing card, weaves narrative threads, and crosses the threshold—but causality is soft: the card glows without clear trigger, the door appears because the story needs it, and the threshold crossing feels more like arrival than a decision that forecloses prior options. The closure image (Elara feeling whole among blooming names) offers Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("embrace the past, flaws and all") rather than demonstrated through a visible choice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present but floats: we learn the room, Elara's role, and the seal by ~120 words, but the causal chain is weak—each discovery ("the seal's symbols matched the rope's braids") arrives as convenient revelation rather than earned deduction. The closure beat (door opens, chamber revealed) is a Decisive Change in knowledge, but the cost is invisible: no on-page price, no foreclosed option, no felt trade-off. The drive lens defaults Causal but the linkages read as declarative rather than motivated, and the ending delivers symmetric satisfaction (all secrets unlocked, chimes richer, legacy complete) without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, satisfying the test. The piece follows a linear causal path (energy beings arrive → Lira seeks bloom → finds it → activates it → storm dissipates), but the decisive change lacks visible cost: Lira succeeds, the world is saved, and she walks away weary but fulfilled. The closure reads as Decisive Change (storm dissipates, balance restored) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"her body weary but her spirit light" substitutes for an on-page forfeiture or trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, and linkage holds, but the final beat does not reconfigure options or impose a felt price that the reader can point to in a specific image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting the baseline test. The core causality—Elara works, discovers alignment, performs ritual, prism reforms—reads as a sequence of steps rather than because/therefore linkage that narrows options. The ritual's late introduction (memory sacrifice) functions as a new rule that solves the problem it did not help create, weakening earned closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the prism whole, melody sounding), but the cost (faded memories) is asserted in summary rather than made undeniable on the page, leaving closure validity marginal under a Causal or Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who (Elara, archivist), where (stormlit observatory, forecourt), and what (examining shadow lengths after fog solidifies) within the opening paragraphs, satisfying orientation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves from monument to monument, gathering sensory fragments and conjecture, building toward a thematic statement rather than a causal turn. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she "knew her work was far from over" and ascends "with a deepening hush in her heart," which restates her initial stance without reweighting it. The final image does not reconfigure options or meaning; it reaffirms her role. Under the Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or pattern break that charges the ending is required; here the ending deflates into summary and a promise of future work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (wandering designer, fortress gates, dusk). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-versus-darkness imagery building to the mosaic sunrise and final flame. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the fortress "became a blooming fortress at dawn"—but the cost is asserted, not shown; we're told "they had won a crucial victory" without visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The sequence is causal (approach, spin fire, build mosaic, ignite again) but the emotional/social change lacks embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of time-fragments accumulate toward a final insight. However, closure lacks on-page cost—Elara's realization ("no longer sought to discover…but to become a part of it") is asserted through summary rather than a decisive action or visible forfeit. The pause with Kael frames the piece but does not return with a concrete choice or consequence that reweights the opening stakes. One meaningful deepening (cicada shifting meaning) occurs, but the ending resolves through declaration rather than image or renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens (training → inversion → climb → transformation) with clear anchoring by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the doll slips and Elara must retrieve it, but the closure ("tasted true silence, and it had set her free") lacks visible cost—no clear foreclosure or trade-off appears on the page. The inversion event itself functions more as backdrop than pressure that narrows options at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: quiet deepening toward Mira's moment of peace. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira finds relief through Elias's curated silence. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph. The cost, however, is largely atmospheric rather than felt: Mira's anxiety "unravels" without visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows future options. The ending satisfies the lens but lacks the sharp edge of consequence that would elevate it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation is anchored quickly (lore keeper, orchard, waterfall, sunrise deadline). However, the closure unit—Lira's realization that the throne represents collective wisdom—lacks causal grounding; nothing in the prior sequence dramatizes this conceptual shift or its cost. The narrative proceeds through a series of revelations (murals, ruby glow, mechanism) that feel like a video-game walkthrough rather than pressure-driven choices. The lens reads as weakly causal with decorative accumulative touches, but the ending's thematic pivot is asserted rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The piece follows a causal arc: encroaching darkness → Lira channels scar-strength through the ring → threshold stabilizes at the cost of a severed bond. However, the climactic turn—"slowly, the darkness began to recede"—occurs off-page between paragraphs without a visible tipping point or micro-reversal that shows *how* her will and the ring's power combine. The cost (broken scar-link) is stated but not dramatized in the moment of choice, reducing felt closure impact under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The portal transition and parallel-dimension chamber constitute two shards, but the middle escalation—activating the machine—feels procedural rather than causally tightened by prior choices. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (hope restored, new purpose), yet the cost remains abstract: "rebuild what was lost" gestures at stakes without showing a forfeited path or visible price paid on the page. The drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid, but the protagonist's agency in the climax is passive (following text instructions, fitting a bolt into a slot) rather than a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens in a reading room, shifts to a bridge via gramophone-induced vision, then returns—this is effectively two locations within a fantasy frame, not two shards with legible transitions. The shadowfigure sequence delivers the journal as pure convenience: Eleanor does nothing to earn the reveal; it is handed to her, violating causal linkage. Closure claims she "understands her role" and will "let the truth set her family free," but no on-page action or renunciation demonstrates cost or forecloses a path. The inferred lens is causal (because-therefore), yet the key turn (journal acquisition) is not motivated by Eleanor's prior choices. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the final paragraph shows what Eleanor gives up or what concrete option is now closed.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (greenhouse, Alaric, nightshade). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: vines shift patterns, program ink seeps into skin, the final image of stringless marionette reweights the opening allegiance. However, the cost at closure is conceptual and oblique—Alaric "stands taller" and "feels less burdened," but no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The resonant reconfiguration lacks the felt price required for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure is a summary statement of achieved purpose ("She had found her purpose") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final paragraph tells us Elara's heart is "lighter" and explicitly moralizes the theme ("a story of the present, of the small kindnesses") instead of landing an image that reweights prior material. Under a Causal lens, the button→letter→draft sequence progresses but does not narrow options or impose a felt price at closure. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara loses or forecloses by choosing this path.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as causal-situational hybrid, but the escalation is weak: Mara finds the archive, retrieves the ledger, and broadcasts it without meaningful resistance or a decision that narrows options. The closure—her vanishing into the night after the broadcast—lacks visible cost; she retains the key, her freedom, and her mission with no on-page forfeiture or reconfiguration. The enforcers' arrival functions as a late complication that she sidesteps rather than a turn that alters stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening paragraph, but causality remains opaque: the prophecy's threat is asserted, not dramatized, and its dissolution follows no because/therefore chain—music simply "envelops" words until they "dissolve." The closure unit lacks legible cost; the grotto "exhales," the saxophonist leaves, and no option or knowledge state has visibly changed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent (mist, moss, prism descriptions layered throughout), yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end—the final image is a static retreat, not a reconfiguration. Under any lens, closure cost is absent from the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and follows an accumulative lens with a clear pattern: discovery → monument-building → research → transformation. However, the closure unit lacks felt cost—Elara's transformation is asserted ("something had shifted forever") rather than demonstrated through a decisive choice or visible sacrifice. The progression relies heavily on summary ("days turned into weeks," "spent days in the archives") that compresses key beats off-page. The moonstone's role as "a key, a fragment of a greater whole" introduces a promise but does not resolve with on-page consequence, leaving the ending in declared resonance without tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal chain—stranger delivers compass, compass points to greenhouse, greenhouse hides staircase, staircase leads to map—but each step is solved by following directions rather than narrowing options through protagonist agency. The closure offers a thematic reconfiguration ("he had finally found his rhythm") but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: he places the map back and returns to his workshop with no on-page forfeiture of a prior want or capability. Under a Causal lens, the linkage reads as because/therefore but the protagonist's role is passive recipient; under Accumulative, the final image reweights his relationship to time but without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is present early (foundry, Elara, coin). The piece gestures toward an Accumulative lens but never tightens meaningfully; the furnace vision is a passive reception rather than a choice-driven turn. Closure claims redemption and understanding but offers no on-page decisive change or visible cost—Elara simply leaves with "quiet resolve" and "luminous regret softened," neither of which is earned by prior causality. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what was paid or forfeited at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative coloring (harp notes "aligning" at the end). Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—figure dissolves, tooth warms in her palm, she climbs out with "luminous ache"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is vague: no tactic or relationship has been altered, no path foreclosed. The figure's release feels automatic once the harp plays, not earned by a protagonist choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed; who Elara is, why she's in this forest, and what "ultraviolet penance" means concretely remain unclear past the first third, costing −0.4. The closure—dropping the pewter strap and feeling "rooted"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she releases the past), but the cost is asserted ("strange sense of release") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (forest as mirror, light intensifies) and vague Causal (she walks, touches leaf, realizes mercy), never cohering into one dominant method by midpoint. No meaningful tightening occurs; the forest passively reflects her thoughts without constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear by the opening paragraph, so no penalty applies. The piece unfolds as a series of conveniences—painting reveals map, map leads to tower, murals yield complete narrative—without motivated linkage or visible cost. The ending declares fulfillment ("its purpose fulfilled") but the reader cannot point to a decisive change, renunciation, or felt price on the page; Lila smiles and climbs back to the market unchanged. Under a Causal lens (inferred from "because/therefore" sequencing), the closure unit is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads Causal: Marcus finds barrel → whispers say "engage" → dust analysis → ghosts point up → he retrieves clock → inserts barrel → building heals. Each beat follows a because/therefore chain, and the closure (clock running, façade sealed, ghosts released) occurs on the page with a visible change. However, the cost is asserted ("weightless burden lifted") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or tactical shift, and the final image ("cracks always reappeared, and he would be there") gestures toward future vigilance without reweighting present stakes. The motivated ellipsis between barrel discovery and ceiling search holds, but the protagonist never faces a choice that narrows his path—each step is procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story provides orientation (glass orchard library, Elara, morning) within acceptable bounds. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara returns to the letterpress smiling, her work "just beginning," which reads as a setup rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The journey through the clouds and the discovery that the library is "alive" do not narrow her options or exact a felt price—she gains knowledge and purpose without sacrifice. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a reweighting with cost; here the final image diffuses rather than charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN early enough. The closure unit—Elara emerging with holographic evidence and whispering a poem—gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("wounds unhealed"). The causal chain from shard-ritual to vision to evidence feels telescoped; the Empiricists' concession and Visionaries' acclaim occur off-page in summary, undercutting the weight of the turn. One meaningful tightening is present (sneaking into the Hall) but the final image doesn't reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The journey to the Covenant collapses into summary ("took him through forests"), voiding causal pressure across the middle. The tether mechanic—"unwound," then "snapped"—supplies a physical task but no tactical cost or failed attempt precedes success. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (light reclaimed, rust recedes) but the cost is conceptual only ("magic spent"), not felt in Elias's present stance or forfeited path. Lens reads Causal with major ellipsis that severs because/therefore linkage in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (factory edge, basement descent, lagoon chamber) and the causal chain is legible: compass → basement → tunnel → lagoon. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: letting the compass sink, accepting mystery over answers), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of a concrete goal or relationship. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric density building to a final image), yet the ending cadence shift is modest; "touched something infinite" tells the reweighting rather than charging it through image. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds it, but the closure lands softly without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as causal-adventure with accumulative overlay, but the closure lands as pure declaration. The archway passage opens conveniently when the slide glows; the chamber's map appears without prior setup or obstacle. Closure is a realization ("keeper of timewoven alliances") stated rather than enacted—no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by ~80 words, avoiding penalty, but the ending substitutes theme summary for dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates as a two-shard sequence (studio → cathedral → studio) within one contiguous window, meeting the mosaic allowance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one, so no penalty applies. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the mural complete, the question answered in the final image), but the cost remains asserted rather than visibly paid—no foreclosed path or visible sacrifice appears on the page. One meaningful deepening (cathedral visit reweights the project) is present, satisfying escalation for accumulative mode, but the conceptual cost at closure is oblique, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (archivist, zeppelin library, dawn, dunes), and the Accumulative lens is signaled early through the diary ritual and lagoon approach. However, closure fails the cost test: the figure's nod and dissolution promise future revelation without altering Elara's options or knowledge on the page; "a shift, as though the sands themselves were holding their breath" is atmospheric assertion, not a legible before/after with felt cost. The structure is a single continuous scene, but the ending lands as setup for a sequel rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the final image offers poetic deferral instead.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by ~100 words). The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town—is signaled, but escalation is absent: Elara kneels, "conceives," and the bottle glows; the cove transforms without resistance, reversal, or narrowing of options. The closure is a Decisive Change (ghost town becomes living place), but the cost is invisible; Elara walks away smiling with no visible forfeiture, failed alternative, or trade-off on the page. The lens reads as weakly Causal (her "working memory" triggers the transformation), but the because/therefore chain is magical rather than motivated, and the final act does not reweigh prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who and where early (Elara, orchard garden atop skyscraper) but "when" remains vague beyond "today" and the silent foghorn. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the wax shaving, symbols, and prophecy layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden "sigh[s] in relief" after Elara speaks), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no tactical choice is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The prophecy's fulfillment feels asserted ("the orchard seemed to sigh") rather than dramatized with on-page consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (deciphering the symbols reveals the Orchadrians' project), but it doesn't narrow options or impose felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Elara stepping through the vortex into the renewed landscape with her winged companion—reads as Decisive Change, but the felt cost is unclear: what option or path does she forfeit? The causal chain is motivated but weak: acorn cap → archway opens → vortex appears → she enters → landscape restored feels procedural rather than earned by protagonist struggle. The drive lens reads Causal, but linkage is thin and the cost at closure is more conceptual than visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through atmospheric density and the bell-rope imagery culminates in a resonant final moment (the bell rings, rain falls in harmony). Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias crosses "the threshold of zero hour" and the sanctuary's secret is revealed, reweighting his role from tester to "keeper of the sanctuary's secrets." However, the cost is conceptual and oblique—there is no visible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page, only the assertion that he "had crossed the threshold." Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The tightening is a single atmospheric crescendo rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors emerge gradually but are present by ~120 words (station, Lira, cosmic janitor). The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, attempting a resonant reconfiguration through the lantern's dimming and Lira's internalized "flourishing stillness." However, the closure lacks visible cost—placing the lantern on a shelf and feeling "forever changed" is asserted, not demonstrated through foreclosed options or tactical shift. The causal chain is weak: coordinates activate "on their own," and the constellation "felt deliberate" without dramatized agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elias" by name only after substantial scene-setting, and the inciting object (stained glass box) arrives late in paragraph two without clear spatial grounding. The closure—performing a ritual that restores the oasis—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is tenuous: Elias discovers fragments (ritual, melody, water) through exploration guided by "whispers" and "contextual clues" that remain vague, creating a because/therefore gap. The covenant's breaking and restoration lack dramatized stakes or visible cost; the land simply "stirs" and "whispers its gratitude" without a legible price paid by Elias. Lens reads as attempted Causal but drifts into Accumulative without teaching the pattern early or paying it off with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Eldermere, silo, Elara's role), avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens reads as causal-hybrid but weakens at closure: activating the device solves the chronometer problem without visible cost—"time had found its rhythm" declares resolution rather than showing what Elara forfeited or what path closed. The garage-sale investigation occupies significant text yet contributes minimally to the final beat, creating a loose middle that does not tighten options. The closure unit ("She had not only mended time but also rediscovered her own connection") asserts conceptual repricing without making the cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors adequately by ~120 words (lagoon, poet, dawn). The inciting snap of the kite string provides a clean structural pivot, and the repair sequence offers a micro-escalation, but the stakes remain abstract—what exactly is at risk if the kite isn't repaired? The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the glowing poem and shared understanding, yet the cost is conceptual rather than legibly felt on the page; no path is visibly foreclosed, no trade-off enacted. The because/therefore linkage from feather → repair → flight is present but mechanical, lacking the tightening that would narrow options or deepen consequence under a Causal or Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (orchard transformation + discovery sequence), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—each paragraph adds detail without narrowing options or raising cost. The ending offers Earned Stasis (Elias completes his work and dies), yet the cost remains abstract: we see no forfeited relationship, no tactical sacrifice, no path foreclosed by his choices on the page. Orientation anchors (temple orchard, Elias, terminal diagnosis) arrive early, preventing the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is functional but lacks pressure—discoveries about carvings and civilization simply accumulate without altering his tactics or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: Elara ascends, encounters amber and pilgrim, reaches the summit chamber, places her amber, descends with realization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—homecoming reframed from formula to felt experience—but the cost remains abstract and asserted ("not in answers but in the questions") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (chamber revelation), meeting minimum pressure for this length, yet the final image does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost: the coachman plants seeds, surveys his work, and departs unchanged, with no decisive reversal, crystallized stance under pressure, or visible price paid. The narrative is purely sequential (and-then structure) without because/therefore causality or meaningful escalation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive reasonably early, but the "after the reef died" timeframe and "gloom-hill" location remain abstract placeholders never concretized or used to constrain choice. The piece reads as a single illustrative tableau rather than a story with earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the leaf's transformation and the phonograph sequence accumulate symbolic weight toward a thematic realization. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—"we're not as far apart as we think"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice is foreclosed, no tactical option narrowed. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one), and the two-shard structure (cabin visit, factory expedition) transitions clearly. However, the riddle's solution ("a way of seeing") and the leaf's glow feel decorative rather than causally motivated, and the final walk home asserts connection without demonstrating the price of that insight.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when by the end of paragraph one, meeting orientation thresholds. However, no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the ending offers only declaration ("her journey had only just begun") without visible cost or a crystallized choice that forecloses a path. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence. Closure form fails the core requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story opens with clear spatial anchors (icebound spire, frozen sanctuary) and the dominant stake (restore the sky) is signaled early. However, the escalation is summarized: "hours turned to moments as the game reached its climax" compresses the chess match into narrative shorthand, and Kael's "daring swap" is told rather than dramatized. The closure—lifting the lid and watching the sky shift—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no path is visibly foreclosed. The lens reads Causal with attempted escalation, but the pivotal beat lacks on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough (whispering gallery, interregnum, Elara). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure should tighten via density or pattern break. However, the ending asserts transformation ("unbound her and set her on a new path") without a concrete on-page cost or a decisive image that reweights prior material. The walk spells words but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered—"unbinding" remains metaphorical and the closure unit lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the first paragraph, but the opening "mercury-glass seer" and "substitutes reality nightly" create initial confusion without immediate payoff. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("home was not a place but a state of being"), yet no on-page action or forfeiture demonstrates visible cost; Elara simply "understands" and smiles, bypassing dramatized consequences. The causal chain is weak: the stone glows, symbols form, and the bookstore rearranges in response to her thoughts without clear because/therefore linkage or constraints that narrow her options. The ending reconfigures conceptually but lacks the felt or visible price required for a clean closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is adequate—who, where, when anchor early—but the drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (tapestry decoding, platinum thread) and a late Causal turn (pulling the thread reveals a message). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the glowing thread and quoted message, but cost is asserted ("weight of her guilt began to lift") rather than shown through forfeited options or altered stance. The Orientation Test passes, yet causality from tapestry-decoding to labyrinth-entry to thread-pull feels loose; the labyrinth "invites her in" by coincidence, and the platinum thread's revelation arrives without prior setup or earned linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (Lira, bone towers, canyon, pre-ritual) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist thickens, echoes fragment, spire glows, shadows coalesce—density increases toward the final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mist parts, revealing "a path forward," and Lira stands "unburdened." Cost is implied ("a piece of herself, a shard of her heart") but not dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of tactics. The spire does its work off-stage between paragraph three and four; the crucial moment when she "would have to surrender" is told, not shown, undercutting the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (peace and hope after chaos), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—Elara's "conjuring" produces memory-visions that flicker and fade without altering her options or foreclosing a concrete path on the page. The workshop's shuddering and gear-spinning feel like atmospheric threat rather than causal pressure that narrows her choices. Under a Causal lens (inferred from "match the pattern," "pressed the charm," "clicked into place"), the charm-statue alignment triggers visions but the narrative does not show what she loses or trades to preserve them.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece infers an Accumulative lens: the detour, oasis discovery, and painting accumulate toward the final display. Orientation anchors (quay painter, coastal cave) land early. The closure—displaying the painting and feeling connected—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant), but the cost is asserted rather than felt; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on the page. The "wrong turn" functions as coincidence-driven discovery, not protagonist agency reshaping options.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vial cork, scent, and lighthouse imagery recur with increasing charge. However, closure arrives through a convenience encounter (the woman appears, delivers the thesis, vanishes) rather than Elias's own accumulation of understanding. The final paragraph declares resolution ("his doubts" gone, the lighthouse "different") without showing cost or a visible before/after in action or stance. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence demonstrates what Elias has forfeited or how his options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements (the beacon's growing effectiveness), but the ending dissolves into summary rather than landing a discrete closure unit with visible cost. The cryptic calls set up a mystery, building the device provides a because/therefore chain, but the resolution—travelers arrive, community forms—occurs in summary across an indefinite span ("soon others arrived") without a final image that reweights prior stakes or forecloses a path on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but closure lacks the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The causal lens holds: Elias finds eye → truthfulness curse → seeks cure → performs ritual → restoration. The closure (burying the eye at dawn, lifting the curse) is decisive and on-page, but the cost reads more as relief than foreclosure—no visible trade-off or price paid. The ritual resolution feels externally authored rather than emerging from protagonist agency, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elias observes traces, finds the journal, pieces together the stranger's quest, and accepts stewardship of borrowed memories. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the boutonnière shifts from relic to trust), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The journal's appearance is convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (antique dealer, shop, midsummer morning). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via thematic realization, but the decisive moment occurs off-page across "the following days" of study rather than in a single dramatized beat. The causal chain from matrix chip → ants → passage → archway → guardian revelation relies on coincidence (ants leading to a never-noticed crack) rather than protagonist agency. The "doorway of decisions" becomes abstract self-help metaphor in the final paragraph, undercutting the portal-fantasy stakes established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes spatial anchors (palace balcony, grotto entrance, chamber) by the first third, satisfying orientation. However, the closure unit—her vow to restore balance—lacks visible cost; the starlight figure delivers exposition, and the queen's acceptance feels like receiving information rather than a decisive change that forecloses options. The drive lens reads as Causal but the final beat substitutes explanation for a causal turn with on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure via the nautilus shell glow and "revalue" language, but the cost remains abstract—no concrete action is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no visible price paid. The "by returning differently" method is explained in dialogue yet never demonstrated through linked tactical beats; the shell glows, they touch it, and the world feels "richer" without causal tightening. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the closure image does not reconfigure prior stakes with legible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates dream-state images toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (mountain cabin, Elara, scroll). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from envying past selves to accepting continuity—but the cost is asserted ("weight lifting") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price. The birch bark scroll's revelation ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") lands as thematic statement rather than a constraining realization that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: fog lifts, screw is handled, interpretation offered, final image reconfigures Elara's stance. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara "finds her own ordinary miracle" by accepting her altered navigation—but the cost is declared rather than dramatized; no specific on-page action or forfeiture makes the "before/after" viscerally legible. The final paragraph summarizes realization instead of letting the image do the work, weakening closure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a lyric reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The piece accumulates pressure through Elara's internal confrontation with superstition, and the quill's crystallization provides a micro turn. However, the closure—peace settling, scars reframed as journey markers—relies on summary and reflection rather than a concrete on-page action or image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The final paragraph tells transformation ("no longer felt like marks of struggle") instead of charging an image or choice that makes the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the perfume bottle accumulates sensory and memory weight across three touches (opening, middle channeling, shelf return). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara places the bottle back, her heart "lighter," reconnection achieved—but cost is asserted ("imperfect miracle") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The orchard's fate and her grandmother's presence remain abstract; no on-page decision narrows options. Orientation anchors (archive, Elara, perfume bottle) land early, so no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the journey accumulates symbolic touches (mural, glowing dictionary, trembling temple) toward a final image of merger and harmony. However, no meaningful cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page—the dictionary floats away, the temple trembles, and the witness steps out "changed" without any visible price, renunciation, or friction. The closure asserts transformation but does not dramatize it with felt consequence, reducing the effect to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, meeting the test. However, the closure relies on a convenient discovery (hidden slot, parchment) that Elias has never noticed despite years of tending the clock, creating a causality gap. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding shift) but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical change results from the revelation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late turn toward epiphany, but the turn is delivered by a prop rather than protagonist agency, undercutting earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides"), but the cost remains abstract—no specific action, relationship, or tactical option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (memory, scrawls, lantern refraction building to an insight), yet the final reweighting lacks the felt price or cadence shift required for a strong RR under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the melody accumulates across calls, the disc's meaning deepens, and the final phone call reconfigures Eli's estrangement into connection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the call after years of silence) with felt relational cost. Orientation is clean early. The piece coheres under its lens, but the causality linking the disc's grooves to the callers' hum relies on assertion ("seemed to echo") rather than dramatized discovery, and the night's progression feels more additive than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through description and discovery, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page. Elara begins documenting a locket's history and ends...documenting it, with no foreclosed path or felt price. The "regenerated covenant" remains thematic decoration rather than a stake that narrows options. Orientation is clear early; causality is clean but flat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately early. The closure—Elara's realization that loneliness is cured through connection—is asserted rather than earned by prior causality; the clock's transformation and the appearance of alternate selves are conveniences that solve a problem they did not help create. The station's temporal blur is introduced late and resolves through magic rather than protagonist agency. Inferred lens: Situational (seeks stance crystallization), but the ending delivers exposition instead of a charged choice or image with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure with on-page cost. Elara arrives at the stillpoint, absorbs emotions, and receives an insight ("it had always been about finding this moment"), but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization forecloses a prior option. The ending summarizes her subsequent work rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration in the scene. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words) and the drive lens remains ambiguous—part causal journey, part lyric accumulation—without teaching a coherent pattern that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The closure unit—Elara writing with the pen to "unbend the timeline"—occurs on the page, but the causal chain from her entry into the void to the resolution reads as summary declaration ("she understood," "each stroke felt like") rather than dramatized reversal. The cost is asserted ("the void stabilized") but not felt in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. Drive lens reads Causal but the because/therefore linkage dissolves into metaphor at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara at harbor docks by moonlight), satisfying orientation. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous—gestures that "seemed to vibrate" and a camera that "clicked, though it had no film" suggest magical realism, yet no coherent rule-set emerges to govern what Elara can accomplish or what resists her. The ending asserts transformation ("The silence was no longer empty") without demonstrating a decisive change in her options or a visible cost; her "triumph" and "found her voice" are declared victories unsupported by prior causality. No meaningful tightening occurs; the sequence moves through repetitive gesture-description beats without escalating pressure or narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when are named early, but no concrete spatial anchor or time cue grounds the reader until well past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure—scroll discovered, promise "rescued"—lands as a reveal rather than a decision or reconfiguration with visible cost. The arsonist's agency is passive observation; the scroll solves a problem it did not help create. Drive lens reads as intended Causal but the trail functions as a treasure-hunt checklist without narrowing options or forcing trades.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara's realization and decision to find others—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no concrete path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no visible price paid. The lagoon's response to her drumming introduces a convenience (the water hums in sync) that enables the epiphany without prior setup or constraint. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sound garden, auroral sorrow, drumming motif), but the ending pivots to a causal decision ("she knew what she had to do") without showing the bridge between sensory accumulation and action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The causal lens wobbles: the map "unfolds itself" and containers "groan as if alive" without taught rules, yet closure depends on a mechanical lock-and-key. The wall of containers appears suddenly with no prior setup, and Mira holding the matching lock is coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. Closure lands—passage opens, whispers validated—but cost is asserted ("the weight of the moment") rather than demonstrated through forfeited options or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (cobalt dock, twilight, guardian role). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the shutter-weaving and mirror moments build texture toward the stranger's verbal release and subsequent hope. However, the closure—"their heart a little less heavy"—relies on assertion rather than a specific image or action that makes the cost undeniable. No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path; the stranger's departure is lighter by declaration, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents summary narration of Elias's plan rather than on-page causal beats. The synchronized window displays materialize off-page in the final paragraph without dramatized preparation, constraint, or reversal. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elias moves from idea to execution without opposition, setback, or cost. The ending declares the rebellion has begun but offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost; the final image is a static tableau of pride rather than a moment that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she retrieves her guarded heart and rows back changed), but the cost remains conceptual and un-priced on the page: what path did she foreclose by detaching? The scrimshaw "slips from her fingers" without consequence, the island fades, yet she retains "its essence"—no visible trade-off. The causal link from dream to whale-call to island is present, but the final beat does not narrow options or charge prior material with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is adequate (farmhouse, turbines, Elara at table by ~100 words). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the whittled heart and final juxtaposition attempt a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("unyielding") rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture. The brother's fade and Elara's private ritual are recounted, not dramatized, so the closure image does not reweight prior on-page pressure. No meaningful escalation tightens options; the piece loops through description and reflection without a turn that narrows tactics or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third with no clear dramatic present anchored by ~120 words (−0.4). The dominant stake—transcending the ordinary through art—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening; the ice cracks and the poem flows without opposition or cost. The ending offers atmospheric assertion ("had done what they came to do") rather than a legible change in options or knowledge. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (courtyard atmosphere, phoenix symbol, plant language, concertina music converging toward thematic reweighting), but the closure lacks on-page cost: the glassblower's validation and Elias's "heart full" epiphany resolve the premise without foreclosing a path or imposing felt price. The phoenix "timeframe shift" is exposition, not dramatized causality; the concertina's spontaneous vibration and plant spirits' response feel coincidental rather than causally motivated by Elias's prior choices. Orientation is clear early, but the awakening mechanic remains abstract—no concrete rules govern how plant arrangements "barter awakenings" or why the concertina responds now.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers fragments of sound to build toward thematic reweighting. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara ends "enlightened" and "ready to propel the world forward" without forfeiting a live option or facing friction. The "artificial pilgrimage" and sound discoveries happen entirely off-conflict; no stake narrows or deepens on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where early enough; the drive lens reads Situational (grief-rooted yearning meets magical pressure). The curtains' illumination and the tattoo's autonomous glow complicate Elara's stance, but the transfer itself is passive—she holds the stencil and warmth spreads—without a decision that narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose), yet the cost is asserted ("promise…to herself") rather than dramatized; no visible path is foreclosed, no tactical shift shown. One meaningful pressure point exists (the light/tattoo sequence), meeting the 600–800 word minimum, but the ending lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph (Elara in her loft after crypto crashes) and maintains spatial coherence throughout. The escalation follows a causal chain: Mira arrives → shares discovery → they map the conspiracy together → arrive at hope. However, the closure lacks visible cost—"for the first time in months, she felt hope" and the Tower-as-blueprint realization arrive as declarations rather than through a decisive choice that forecloses a path. The "something new could rise" ending gestures toward future action rather than landing an on-page change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where by paragraph one. The closure unit—Elara's realization that the pagoda is a mirror—qualifies as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains diffuse: no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the "unlocking something far greater" feels awarded rather than earned through prior pressure. The archive's "steadily unpredictable" layout is mentioned but never constrains a choice. One tightening occurs when she recognizes the erased pattern on the floor, but this reversal doesn't narrow options or raise stakes—it simply triggers the pagoda's automatic response.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor by ~120 words (library, Elara), but the temporal frame ("after dreams become shareable") remains abstract decoration without on-page pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (the shadow accretes across footage, then materializes), but closure relies on a convenient mechanism—pressing stone to vial—that the story does not establish or constrain. The shadow's transformation from threat to "reflection of collective hopes" is told rather than dramatized, and the final sculpture offers no visible cost or foreclosed path. Cost Proof Test fails: no exact line shows what Elara sacrifices or loses by this act.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. However, the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration that operates almost entirely through assertion: Elara "felt a shift," "knew that she was not alone," and "felt a profound sense of peace" without on-page action or choice that forecloses a path. The cost is declared ("wounds that needed healing") but never made visible in a decision or renunciation. Under an Accumulative lens, the final placement of the tail tip could qualify as a charged image, but the surrounding exposition flattens any felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story sets "after the anesthesia wore off" as the timeframe but never anchors who, where, or when by ~120 words; Elara's identity, the tower's location, and the causal relationship between anesthesia and memory loss remain vague, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—sand merging in hourglasses and scars fading—occurs without visible cost; the protagonist does not forfeit, endure, or crystallize a stance that forecloses a path. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric gestures without accumulative pattern-teaching, causal links that teleport props and abilities), and the "displaced miracle" resolves via discovery rather than protagonist agency. Causality breaks: the ivy "guides" her to a tunnel she somehow didn't know existed in her own tower, the second hourglass appears with no prior setup, and the plants' telepathic voice shifts from "gentle reassurance" to urgent directive without on-page trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the film strip's energy builds through layered goodbye letters until Elara decides to take it and "release the love it held." Orientation is clear (projection booth, night, psychometry reading). The closure—her decision to take the strip with a new sense of purpose—lands on the page, but the cost is implied rather than visible; we don't see what she forecloses or what specific price she pays in the moment. The "incubate it further" phrasing delays concrete consequence, softening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece establishes a lens of accumulative texture but never tightens or reconfigures; Lira traces stars, rests, remembers, then rests again with no decisive change, no renunciation that forecloses a path, and no conceptual repricing. The ending ("ready to follow their path wherever it may lead") is pure setup—charged poise requires crystallized options and undeniable pressure, but here options remain vague and cost absent. The structure is a single meditative scene, valid for this length, but closure does not land.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks felt cost: Mara succeeds fully—archive reignited, sparks diverging, new futures appearing—with no visible price or foreclosed option. The "understanding" in the final paragraph functions as tell-only theme summary rather than a decisive change or renunciation earned by prior causality. The drive lens defaults to Causal but the because/therefore chain dissolves into convenient magic (clock glows → archive responds → success) without protagonist agency shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the timeframe is vague ("weeks ago," "days turned into weeks"). The piece follows a causal lens through most beats but the closure arrives via light-bathed epiphany without visible cost: Eamon slots the gear, the machine activates, and he "understood"—no foreclosed option, no price paid on the page. The summary ending ("he knew his journey was far from over") replaces a decisive change with a restatement of premise, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara) and where (dock, ferry, ridgeway) within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building pressure through mist, twilight, and repeated motifs—but the closure unit (punching the air, feeling the star imprint) remains metaphorical without a legible before/after change in options or knowledge. The cost is asserted ("The leash was gone") rather than demonstrated on the page, and the ferryman's reappearance as a younger figure introduces a late rule change without prior setup, weakening causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. The discovery sequence—stain, door, pedestal, bolt—provides causal linkage, but the climactic "surge of energy" delivers knowledge via magical transfer rather than dramatized choice, weakening agency at closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias shifts from silent duty to active keeper), but the cost—playing the piano, choosing to remain—is asserted more than felt on the page. Drive lens reads Causal with an Accumulative overlay (the bolt's symbolic return), held consistently. Cost proof test: "a new melody had begun" and "courage to hope" are conceptual claims; the visible cost is the act of playing, which is present but carries limited on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The closure unit—pretender's facade cracks when handed the pellet—lacks visible cost to Elara; the pretender's capitulation is asserted, not dramatized through prior narrowing of options. The causal lens is attempted but key turns (pretender finds messages, responds, appears in person) occur off-page or via summary, breaking because/therefore linkage. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at closure shows Elara forfeiting or risking something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece follows a reflective accumulative design: Elara notices the torn page, researches, and reaches a thematic conclusion. However, closure reads as conceptual summary ("Some paths disappear...") without on-page cost or a decisive image that reweights prior material—no choice is made, no path foreclosed, no felt price paid. The ending explains rather than enacts, violating the Closure requirement for visible or undeniable cost. Under an Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or charged final image is needed; here we receive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (the stone-circle hum and stargazing vision layer meaning rather than narrow options causally). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lira's purpose crystallizes in the vision and she steps toward action—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we are told she "knew what she had to do" without a visible forfeit or tactical constraint. The hum and vision provide a tightening of focus, meeting the one-deepening threshold for this length, but the final image ("thunderous serenity of the cosmos, the hum of the ancient stones") relies on thematic declaration more than a reweighted particular.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is late and cluttered: "insurgent grandmother," "Reconstruction," "new regime," and "uprising" arrive as labels without spatial or temporal anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Mara walking away with the cracked embryo—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only ("what was to come") without a visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows her options in the present. The causal chain from kite script → embryo alignment → "unsealing" relies on convenience: the guard vanishes, the springs erupt in light, and the vision arrives without obstruction. No meaningful tightening occurs; the plot advances by declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (arboretum, seaside cliff, Zara's backstory). The photograph rescue on the cliff edge functions as a reversal that tightens stakes, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Zara shifts from survivor-seeking-refuge to artist-capturing-resilience—with felt emotional cost. However, the lens wavers between Causal (photograph retrieval) and Accumulative (grief processing through art), and the cost at closure is more asserted ("weight lift from her shoulders") than shown through a concrete forfeiture or visible change in her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the lighthouse library setting is stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara gathers cards, reinterprets symbols, and ascends with renewed purpose. However, closure lacks on-page cost—she smiles, feels possibility, and climbs with hands steady, but no live option is foreclosed and no felt price is paid in the final image. The transformation is declared ("her art...would never be the same") rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals a causal lens early (tracker follows drone to tent, woman reveals ink's nature, vision unfolds) and delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara sees her brother's final moments and shifts from seeking control to acceptance. Orientation is clean. However, the closure depends on a convenient reveal: the woman has the ink and explains its purpose exactly when needed, and Elara's transformation occurs through passive reception of imagery rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The cost—releasing the need to rewrite history—is asserted more than demonstrated through visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes a clear inciting incident (the letter) and a final act (copying the data), but the causal chain is weakened by convenience: the terminal "flickers to life at her touch" with no obstacle, the encryption is bypassed in a sentence, and the authorities' response is delayed just long enough for her to succeed. The closure unit—Elara standing with the data, knowing "everything had changed"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change in her options or relationships. The phrase "within the blink that follows surprise" appears only as atmosphere in two places, never tightening the action into urgent compression. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), so no penalty applies there, but the ending delivers emotional summary rather than a legible reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens inferred as Causal-Situational hybrid: Kael's warning introduces external threat, Elara accepts the blade, days pass with fortification, ending crystallizes her self-authored path. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final image presents her standing with the blade, farm thriving—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible in the ending beat. The "days passed" ellipsis compresses what could be escalation, flattening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no causal linkage drives the plot: Kael stands, walks in a zigzag, and the goddess simply appears without any decision or action from him altering the outcome. The ending asserts restoration ("whole again") but no on-page cost is visible—the rail spike glows, constellations resume, problem solved. Under a Causal lens (the only lens the setup implies), coincidence resolves rather than protagonist agency, violating closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a causal chain—journalist's call → investigation → discovery → symbolic defiance—but key beats are summarized rather than dramatized. The climactic meeting with the director and the final telescope recalibration both happen off-stage or in fast summary, denying the reader the on-page pressure that should earn the closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration through the symbolic act, but the cost remains abstract ("orbits of regret would always be a part of her") rather than a visible forfeiture of safety, connection, or resource that we see her pay.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (constellation work layering guilt, amber object recurring, letters discovered, letters written) but the closure—"she had learned to listen"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior material with visible cost. The letter-response sequence is summarized ("With each letter, she felt the weight…") rather than dramatized, and the firmware's shift from roar to melody happens off-stage. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the laboratory's function and Elara's role are explained across the first third without a clean anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via listening/redemption) lands but cost is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words; no penalty there. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the escalation is unclear: Elara kneels, picks up the flake, whispers a question, receives a vision of the grotto's past, and stands—no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The closure offers a conceptual repricing ("meaning was not found but created"), yet the cost remains asserted rather than legible in a final image or action. Under the chosen lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required but not delivered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes plaza, mosaic, and Elara's reflective task by ~15% (orientation anchored). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of reflection on mercy builds toward the final mosaic image. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—Elara begins rearranging tesserae and completes the image without friction, obstacle, or a moment where cost forecloses a path. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (the plaza "had become a beacon of hope"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page. The "first step" framing defers closure rather than landing it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is adequate by ~120 words (moon, hedge maze, orchard, ghost), so no penalty applied. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—atmospheric intensification through synesthetic currents and garden imagery—but the closure lacks visible cost: the woman walks away "steady," the coin glows "softly," and Mara feels "warmth" with "bittersweet" nostalgia, all of which deflate pressure rather than reconfigure it with felt price. The fractured timeline is mentioned three times but never dramatized as a constraint that narrows options; it functions as backdrop. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early but does not pay it off with undeniable cost at closure, so the RR form is incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. However, closure lacks a decisive change with visible cost: Elara completes her light painting and feels "willowglass hope," but no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no knowledge shifted. The montage structure ("She worked through the night") compresses the creative act into summary, leaving no on-page reversal or deepening that narrows her choices. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending offers reassurance without reweighting the telepathy-pill premise or her skepticism with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The fossil's floating and chamber discovery follow a because-therefore chain, but closure offers only an assertion of purpose ("journey had only just begun") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The piece ends on declaration instead of dramatized alteration or renunciation. Drive lens reads Causal through the fossil sequence, but the ending shifts to thematic summary without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to teach a clear pattern or deliver a decisive reconfiguration at closure. The ending offers only a vague declaration that "truths could be unearthed" and "possibilities could bloom," with no on-page cost or visible alteration in Elara's options or knowledge. The jar's echo swells into voices that share wisdom, but this moment is summarized rather than dramatized, and the aftermath simply resets to silence. Orientation is present early, but the causal chain is weak—buttons arranged in rows somehow unlock the echo without clear mechanics or meaningful tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening but the dominant stake remains vague ("fixing what's broken" is conceptual, not a concrete on-page goal with legible consequence). The piece accumulates atmosphere and backstory but no meaningful tightening occurs—the codes lead to a letter that delivers an epiphany without prior causal setup. The closure (Elara "felt it—the stir of unused courage") is asserted rather than earned by a decisive change with visible cost. Drive lens remains ambiguous between accumulative and causal; neither fully lands.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "gloom-hill coachman" and "fog-bound river crossing" early, but no concrete spatial anchors or immediate stakes appear until the figure arrives midway. The closure—a delivered scroll and philosophical exchange—occurs through coincidence (the figure appears, speaks, vanishes) rather than protagonist agency. The "palimpsest promise" is explained rather than dramatized, and the needle's symbolic role is told in dialogue rather than tested. Drive lens reads Situational but the stance crystallization lacks visible cost; the coachman simply accepts the explanation and drives forward.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when by the second paragraph) but operates in summary-accumulative mode without a legible closure unit that lands with cost. The final paragraph asserts healing and hope but the oasis restoration occurs off-page in a time-skipped summary ("slowly began to heal"). No on-page decisive change, earned stasis with visible foreclosure, or conceptual repricing charges the ending—Elara sits in peace as a fait accompli. The lens drifts between causal (glass mechanics) and accumulative (sun patterns as discovery) without teaching a coherent pattern or delivering a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elara on fire escape, harbor setting). Drive lens reads Situational: the encounter itself is the pressure, and the "quivering hush" frames expectation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (kindred spirit found), but the cost is asserted ("found a piece of me") rather than dramatized through forfeited option or visible trade-off. The lockmaster's arrival and the tooth's return feel coincidentally symmetric rather than causally earned by Elara's prior tactics. One tightening occurs (descent to dock, meeting), but the final image lacks the undeniable felt price required for solid RR.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elena is, her lineage connection, and the library's mechanics arrive as exposition rather than anchored cues, penalized −0.4 in Q2. The closure involves Elena receiving power from the orb and understanding her role, but the decision or renunciation that forecloses a path is absent; she is granted transformation rather than earning it through a visible choice. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere and layered world detail toward a final reweighting), but the cost at closure is conceptual only—"she was its embodiment"—without a felt price or forfeited option on the page. The stone circle's mechanics and the sundial's unlocking function arrive late without prior constraint shaping her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the third paragraph, meeting the baseline test. The story attempts Accumulative closure: the spiral placement triggers the installation's light-pulse, revealing "connections," then Elara "felt a profound sense of peace." However, no visible or felt cost accompanies this moment—she walks away "lighter," which reads as reward rather than foreclosure or trade-off. The Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable pressure or cost; here the ending delivers epiphany-summary without on-page price, weakening closure validity under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and tracks a causal chain: signal → decode → counter-frequency → distortion. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara's "victory" is immediately undercut by external protest, then she smiles and returns to work, a soft reset rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The "battle far from over" frame diffuses pressure instead of crystallizing stakes. Inferred lens: Causal with Situational elements; the ending does not hold pressure under either.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The piece follows a single continuous scene with causal forward motion: compass guides → passage opens → chamber reached → shard grasped → walls shift → transformation. However, the closure effect—walls expanding, shadows receding, liberation achieved—lands as a soft reset without on-page cost or foreclosed path; the "mutiny" reshapes her fears into strength through assertion rather than a dramatized trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final reversal lacks the visible price required for a clean Decisive Change or the undeniable pressure needed for Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (mist, ribbon fragments, the portrait as closure image), but the final reconfiguration lacks undeniable cost: Elara leaves "lighter" after sketching, with no path visibly foreclosed or tactic altered. The ribbon fragments "seem to merge" and "intertwine" through assertion rather than causal pressure. Cost is gestured at ("far from solved") but not felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the causal lens remains ambiguous: the copper nail "guides" without clear mechanism, the coded stanzas are deciphered off-page, and the ritual ("speak the name") resolves without prior setup or cost. The closure—her great-uncle's reappearance and the choice "to restore or to protect"—is told rather than shown, and the actual decision and its consequence are elided in "she made her choice, and the world shifted once more." No on-page cost is legible in the final image; the station solidifies and the sky clears without visible forfeiture or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as weakly Causal with accumulative texture attempted. The Orientation Test passes by ~120 words (mountain pullout, fiddler, glass flake), but the closure—Bridge-Song raising the fiddle after discovering the sanctuary—lands as convenient arrival rather than earned transformation. The glass flake's "pixelated" images function as a vague treasure map; no because/therefore chain shows how observation narrows options or imposes a choice with visible cost. The final "gateway" and melody declare resolution without on-page reconfiguration of prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (abandoned circus train, Elias, foreign money). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dusk, train cars, journal, money accumulate toward a thematic reweighting. However, the closure unit is a stated moral ("some paths circle back... to teach us") rather than an image or action that reprices prior material with cost. The journal discovery and scavenger encounter function as information drops, not reversals that narrow options. No on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a path; Elias simply leaves "at peace."

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (midnight, observatory, Elara). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: star patterns accumulate meaning until the final realization. However, no on-page closure with visible cost occurs—Elara "closes her eyes," writes, and "steps out into the dawn" without forfeiting an option, enduring a loss, or crystallizing a stance that forecloses a path. The "understanding" is told, not shown through a decisive image or renunciation. Routing −0.6 for missing felt cost at closure under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Eira's choice to step into the vortex, her dance through expanding circles, and the seed's response create a linked chain that culminates in the vortex calming. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (her warlike serenity shifts from shield to quiet resolve), but the cost—what specific future action or relationship is now foreclosed—remains somewhat diffuse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seed begins to glow and she must voice her failure, narrowing her options.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Elara places the clipping on the pedestal, the covenant mends—reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted ("balance restored") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or tactical alteration. The causal lens is nominally present (clipping guides her through the maze) but the maze's resistance never meaningfully narrows her options; she "presses on" without setback. The final paragraph tells us "purpose fulfilled" instead of showing what she has lost or what path she has foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes orientation quickly (catacomb orchard, Elara's mission) and moves through discovery → confrontation → resolution with clear because/therefore links. Closure achieves Earned Stasis: Elara chooses to remain bound with visible cost (life given up), and the burned card shifts from debt-marker to choice-token. However, the shadow-figure encounter leans on abstraction ("This was never about the card") rather than concrete dramatization, and the final turn feels declared more than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the speaker grille scrap appears three times with slight reweighting, but the closure arrives as a summary realization ("It represented the noise and the silence...") rather than a charged image or decisive act with legible cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the first paragraph. The escalation is thin—Elias reflects, then walks to the window, then decides to leave—without a meaningful tightening of options or a felt price paid on the page. The final paragraph tells us he feels "something new" rather than showing a decisive change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal accumulative structure: translator studies seed → plants it → visions arrive → tree grows → fruit harvested → understanding gained. However, the closure—"she felt at peace"—delivers resolution through summary rather than a decisive on-page choice or reconfiguration with visible cost. The "wave of understanding" is told, not dramatized, and no live option is foreclosed. Lens: Accumulative/Causal hybrid; the ending declares thematic closure without charging the final image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The dominant stake—stabilizing migrating identities—drives a single continuous scene with one meaningful action (dissolving the orb into the pool). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: identities stabilize "though not in their original forms," and Elara accepts transformation rather than restoration. However, the cost is asserted ("not a failure but a transformation") rather than dramatically legible; no on-page sentence shows what she or the town gave up. The lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid, but the ending leans toward summary rather than a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece orients who/where/when within the opening lines, avoiding orientation penalty. However, the closure unit—placing the pearl in the crown and receiving a vision—lacks felt cost: Elara gains purpose and resolve without forfeiting anything on the page. The causal chain is weak: the pearl's "pull" is convenience rather than earned motivation, and the crown's mechanics appear exactly when needed. The final paragraph tells us her journey is beginning rather than showing a decisive change with price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational elements (graffiti prompts, the station as threshold). Orientation anchors arrive early enough (station, Elara, accordion). The closure unit—Elara tracing her self-drawn map and finding "first steps"—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: no prior live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, and the "measure of peace" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete constraint or sacrifice. The acquaintance's sudden appearance and departure feel coincidental rather than causally integrated, weakening the earned quality of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, causality is weak: the protagonist follows a hum without obstacle, the library "trembles" in acknowledgment without resistance, and the parchment's light at the end is granted rather than earned through prior choice. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the journey begins), but no visible cost or foreclosed option appears on the page—she smiles and steps into mist with resolve, unchanged by sacrifice. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure sequence—violin played, vines awaken, scouts freeze, violin becomes opaque—lands on the page, but the causal linkage is weak: Elara's decision to play the violin is not earned by prior pressure or a narrowing of options; she simply "knew what she had to do." The scouts' defeat is convenient (minds clouded by song) rather than a consequence of her tactics or sacrifice. The violin's transformation from ice to opaque lifelessness occurs without cost to Elara herself; no visible price forecloses a path or alters her stance. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is soft; under Accumulative, the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The piece reads as outline-like sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is established early (skyborne grotto, beautician mortician role, aurora above). The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from seeking sparks to embracing stillness—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no concrete option is foreclosed or visible price paid. The traveler's appearance and resurrection function as deus ex machina, delivering the thematic insight rather than letting Elara's prior choices create the turn. Under a Hybrid lens (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural ending), the final image reweights the premise, but the because/therefore chain weakens at the climax when the emerald chip resolves a problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early enough, but the causal spine collapses into convenient magic: the hairpin "calls" her, the map "she had never noticed" materializes, the scallop shell teleports her to a lake with no established world rules, and the vision-dump resolves her yearning off-stage. The closure—Elara smiling, "knowing she had finally found her source of contentment"—is told summary with no on-page decisive change, visible cost, or tactical alteration. The piece reads as outline-sequencing (and-then) under a vague Accumulative lens that never coheres or deepens; the final image repeats the opening posture without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is established (lighthouse, dawn, Elias), but no causal escalation occurs: Elias arrives with a task already defined, listens to chimes, writes a letter, and leaves—an and-then sequence without pressure. The closure (sealing the letter and walking away) involves no on-page decisive change, no visible cost, and no reconfiguration of stakes; Elias feels "fulfillment" by authorial assertion rather than dramatized consequence. The wind chimes "speak of balance" through summary rather than causally altering Elias's knowledge or options. Mara's off-page struggle never crystallizes into a present dilemma with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (unburdening through revelation), but cost remains abstract: "heart heavy but unburdened" tells the shift without showing a foreclosed path or immediate consequence. Orientation is delayed—"backwards aging researcher" and "floating rock meditation platform" are named but not anchored spatially or temporally until well past the opening, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure (apply −0.3). Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative reflection → Causal revelation), the story teaches its pattern but the final spoken confession is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening closure legibility. The ripple-vision trance deepens texture but does not narrow options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and pattern-reading dominate). Orientation anchors are present early (canyon, Kael, arrowhead, bone towers). The closure unit—"not movement, but stillness; not answers, but the questions"—offers a Conceptual Repricing, yet the cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page; no concrete option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The bird-pattern revelation ("the arrowhead was not just a weapon but a compass") lands as exposition rather than dramatized discovery that changes Kael's stance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who Eli is (underachieving mage), where (icebound spire), and the stakes (find keystone to prove manual magic) arrive piecemeal across the first third without a concrete anchor by ~120 words, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The closure unit—touching the keystone and feeling "clarity and purpose"—lacks visible cost; the trap stops "as if the spire itself acknowledged his effort," a passive coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. The drive lens is ambiguous (part quest-causal, part lyric meditation on creativity) and never coheres at closure, warranting an additional −0.3. One tightening (walls closing) occurs but is externally solved by a conveniently functional harness rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece orients who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's vow crystallizes his quest, reweighting the sky lanterns as "luminous vows" rather than wishes. However, the cost is asserted ("his journey had only just begun") rather than foregrounded in a visible forfeiture or narrowing of options on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—layered images converge at the vow—but the final image lacks the pressure or trade-off that would make the poise undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes a clear who/where/when early, satisfying orientation. However, no meaningful causality links the distillation process to Lira's choices: she initiates the apparatus, it succeeds immediately, and each coin she submerges advances the prophecy without friction or cost. The ending declares alignment and rebirth ("it was a beginning") but no on-page change in options, knowledge, or stance occurs—Lira's situation at the close is functionally identical to her situation at the start, with success simply asserted. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), the story lacks a closure unit with felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives clearly (observatory, Elara, dusk). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from passive grief to active naming—but the cost is conceptual and told rather than felt: "her heartbreak had not been in vain" asserts meaning instead of dramatizing forfeiture or changed options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere building toward a ritual), yet the final image dissolves the sea monsters back into the page without leaving a persistent constraint or visible sacrifice. The ending reconfigures her stance, but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the dripping-rates melody, bell restoration, and returning waves build toward a final image of renewed energy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the viaduct hums, waves rise, Eliard feels purpose—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page; no prior choice is visibly foreclosed, no price paid except "the weight of the task ahead" (future, not present). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs (bell holds together, ocean responds), satisfying the lens, but the ending reconfigures atmosphere more than options or knowledge with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece operates in summary-tell mode: Elias finds objects, follows a trail, sets up an exhibit, and the town heals—all reported rather than dramatized at pressure points. No meaningful tightening occurs; the photographs solve a problem (town amnesia) they did not help create, arriving as convenient historical artifacts. The closure—townspeople recognizing ancestors, laughter returning—lacks visible cost or a decision that narrows Elias's options. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words), but the lens remains vague between Accumulative and Causal without teaching a pattern or landing a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the boundaries between logic and intuition "soften"), but the cost is conceptual assertion rather than visible forfeiture or constraint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first ~100 words, satisfying the test. The causal chain from starlings → crystal → flame → altar is present but relies on convenience (the flame "beckons," the crystal "recognizes her") rather than motivated choice. No meaningful tightening narrows options; Elara follows each beckoning signal without friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the seeker is, why they're climbing, and what "restore order" means remain vague past the 120-word mark (−0.4). The "pattern finally revealed itself" at climax is pure assertion—no on-page sequence shows what changed or what the seeker did differently. No visible cost: the arbor "celebrates," dawn arrives, burden remains "a silent companion." Drive lens appears Causal but linkage is absent; under Accumulative/Textural the piece never teaches its pattern or delivers a cadence shift that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—shattering the jar and merging with the brain—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "emotional numbness lifted, replaced by a clarity Kael had never known" tells the change without showing forfeited options or felt price. The "duel" with the brain unfolds through metaphor ("each strike of the swords was a question") without causal pressure or motivated decisions that narrow Kael's tactical options. Lens ambiguity persists: the piece gestures toward Causal (duel structure) but resolves via summary assertion, making the dominant mode unclear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Eli is, where the tunnel is located, and what "after the final grain slips through the hourglass" concretely means remain vague past 120 words, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (laughter begins to return), but the cost is conceptual and off-page rather than visible in Eli's choices or losses; the "weary smile" and "glimmer of hope" are told, not dramatized through forfeited options. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (building sound/emotion) and Causal (restore laughter) without teaching a stable pattern early. The closure lands softly but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story presents a situation (Elara holds the pendant, the keeper explains the cost) but the climactic "I will wait" decision does not close a dramatized on-page choice with felt consequence—no path is visibly foreclosed, and the pendant simply dims passively. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the ending reads as Earned Stasis without legible cost: waiting is announced, not enacted with sacrifice. The drive lens wobbles between situational pressure and thematic lyric; the closure does not tighten under either.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a final Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation via creative destruction). Closure lands on the page—sapling emerges, crozier fragments nourish soil, Elara's purpose reweights—but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid; we see the transformation but not a tangible forfeiture that narrows future options. The "penny drop" moment bridges backstory (failed experiments) to present action, yet the chant and crozier insertion lack causal grounding in earlier beats—no prior hint that this exact method would work.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors coalesce only after ~150 words, harming immediate comprehension (−0.4). The closure unit—"she had found herself"—asserts change without visible cost; the shard's power "flows freely" as convenience rather than sacrifice. Linkage is declarative: "she realized her mistake" twice in summary. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design (melody threading towers) but the final image ("reborn, a testament") is abstract thesis rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is beyond "deckhand," where exactly she stands in the grotto, and what "three nights prior" means in a world where "clocks run sideways" remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The vanishing ferry premise is declared but never dramatized as a live problem Mara navigates on the page; she steps into the rift, emerges, and "resets time itself" through unexplained mechanics. Closure occurs (ferry restored, rift sealed) but the cost is asserted in a final paragraph summary rather than shown through a decisive choice or image that makes before/after legible. The hourglass "now filled with glowing sand" functions as a prop rather than a causal lever Mara pulls.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established early (who, where, what she's doing). The piece accumulates imagery—walls melting, roots sprouting, the shadow-man—but the closure unit is weak: Elara leaves with "the thread still clutched in her hand" and a vague sense that "her work was far from over." This reads as continuation rather than reconfiguration; no decisive change, no clear cost that forecloses a path. The final image asserts change ("the world felt sharper") but doesn't demonstrate it through a beat that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present early (benthic city, harbor, instructor role). The piece reads as accumulative/thematic but lacks a single decisive tightening that narrows options with felt cost. The ending montage (weeks into months, navigation towers remain, Elara smiles) summarizes rather than dramatizes closure. The resonance/vibration moment gestures toward a Resonant Reconfiguration but remains abstract; no on-page cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is anchored early (atrium, twilight, hearing aid on pedestal). The causal lens is attempted but weakens: the hearing aid pulses guide Elara to the photograph without reversal or complication, and the "Protect her story" whisper offers no on-page cost or foreclosed path—Elara simply slips the photo into her satchel and exits. Closure reads as summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final paragraph asserts "incidental heroism" and "profound discoveries" without dramatizing the price or reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is slow: we don't learn Elena is a spelunker or that the facility is underwater until the second paragraph, and "beneath the crashing waves" reads metaphorical before it registers as literal (−0.4). The lens is ambiguous—causal beats (prying the vault, touching the fleck) coexist with lyric atmosphere ("crashing hush," "phase transition") without a taught pattern or clear dominance at closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (her claustrophobia "no longer controlled her"), but the cost is abstract: no on-page forfeiture, injury, or tactical price accompanies the shift. The phase-transition sequence bypasses rather than earns resolution—Dr. Voss delivers exposition, the fleck "dims," and Elena emerges "calm" without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns in ink align with screen data, leading to a voice that confirms her erasure. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara "smiles" with a "steady heartbeat" after the revelation, soft-resetting the anxiety established earlier. The defragmentation process and ghost's materialization happen mostly off-stage; the voice's wisdom arrives without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The final image reweights the shard and observatory but without undeniable pressure or felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric aspirations. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—diamond shatters, language saved, Lira emerges changed—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("her copper veins faded") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or reweighted image. The because/therefore chain from humming → diamond glow → language preserved lacks intermediate resistance; the solution feels convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Lena releasing control) but the closure arrives via summary ("she felt a shift within herself") rather than on-page action that forecloses a path. The garden's metamorphosis and cryptid encounter reverse themselves without consequence, leaving no visible cost or narrowed options. Orientation anchors—who Lena is undercover from, what experiment failed, how the arrowhead "shifts dimensions"—remain vague past the opening third. The drive lens wavers between causal (arrowhead quest) and accumulative (atmosphere) without a taught pattern, and the ending does not commit to either.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. A decisive change occurs on the page—statues fall, orchard heals—but the closure lacks felt cost; Elara simply succeeds without sacrifice or foreclosed option. The causal chain from "shell pulses" to "roots attack statues" reads as convenience plotting: the shell's mechanics are never established, so the escalation feels authored rather than earned. The inferred lens is Causal but linkage is weak; the shell's signal property appears only when needed, not through motivated discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Elias plans to deliver the bottle, executes the smuggling, and achieves temporary unity. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening (mailman, border, twilight, arcade). However, closure lacks felt cost—the bottle works exactly as hoped, representatives shake hands, and Elias simply walks away with his hope intact. The "brief moment" framing acknowledges impermanence but doesn't dramatize what Elias forfeits or risks in the present; the stakes dissolve rather than resolve with visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (the patrol chase), but the ending's consequence remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The accumulative/textural lens holds through the oasis discovery and carousel restoration, but the closure cost is abstract—"sense of purpose he had long forgotten"—rather than a visible forfeiture or reweighted choice. The singing that awakens the carousel reads as convenient magic without prior setup or constraint; the fragment's light "burst" solves the problem it did not help create. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of the oasis), but the final restoration lacks felt cost or a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present (who, where, when by ~120 words). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the escalation consists of three sequential book-rearrangement beats without narrowing options or raising felt cost. The doorway appears as a reward rather than a reconfiguration earned by prior pressure. The ending restores order without legible on-page cost—Elara knows a secret, but no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Closure form reads as Conceptual Repricing attempt, yet the conceptual cost is asserted ("protect it") rather than dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. However, no causal because/therefore linkage drives the sequence: Elara sets up, light pulses inexplicably, she paints, the painting "vitalizes itself" without her agency, and she smiles—a series of and-then beats. The closure unit is a declarative summary ("she had been searching for all along: not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew") with no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. The inferred lens wobbles between accumulative (sunrise photography ritual) and a failed causal arc, never cohering at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (shadows, nexus imagery, the glowing lock of hair), but the closure unit—shattering the orb and releasing "the idea"—remains conceptually vague. The story anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, avoiding orientation debt. However, the decisive change is told ("everything around her felt different") without legible on-page cost or a concrete before/after shift that the reader can trace. The closure feels like a declaration rather than a reconfiguration charged by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—mushrooms, locket, constellation pattern, final alignment—but closure lacks a decisive on-page reconfiguration or felt cost. The ending presents Elara "exactly where she was meant to be" without foreclosing a path or crystallizing a renunciation; the stars align and mushrooms glow brighter, but no decision or cost is legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The phrase "decades later" appears twice but remains temporally vague, creating minor confusion about whether it references her grandmother's era or Elara's search duration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (forgotten library, Elara, shard-mirror task) arrive early. The piece unfolds as a single extended scene with one dominant stake (annotating the shadow). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow "softens," the library feels "alive again," and Elara's backwards walk steadies—but the cost is asserted rather than shown (no path is foreclosed, no tactical consequence visible on the page). The final paragraph tells us the work succeeded without dramatizing what was risked or lost, reducing closure to declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation is delayed—"verdant parapet" and Elara's occupation arrive early, but her specific present goal and the immediate situation remain abstract past the 120-word threshold (−0.4). No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the seed sprouts without complication, and the "portal" outcome is declared rather than earned through causal linkage. The closure unit (sprouting seed as triumph) lacks visible cost: no prior stake is foreclosed, no tactic altered. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but fails to deliver a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: silence accumulates, knots unravel in sequence, and the final stillness reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (spirits find peace, Elara finds solace), but the cost remains abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the net simply "sagged" and whispers "faded." The tightening (stubborn knot → whispered plea → breakthrough) provides one pressure point, but it resolves through persistence rather than a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the ending ("profound stillness") reconfigures the opening hush, yet the conceptual cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who Elara is (map framer), where she stands (vault vs. henge proximity), and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words; "at the spot where a map tears" is poetic but spatially opaque. Drive lens is ambiguous—opening suggests Causal (video comparison should narrow options), middle drifts Accumulative (layered imagery), ending lands on summary reverence without a decisive change or felt cost on the page. The chapel discovery is recounted rather than dramatized, and the final image ("stood as a testament") abstracts rather than charges prior material. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and lens ambiguity −0.4; Q3 cap at 7.0 applies.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with steady deepening through discovery, but closure relies on Elara's articulated realization ("wasn't about understanding death but about embracing the impermanence") rather than a final image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The snow globe is placed on the floor as a gesture of release, but the emotional or opportunity cost of that act remains abstract—no prior path is visibly foreclosed, and the library's shift from "tomb" to "lullaby" is asserted in summary rather than felt through a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes who and where by the opening, satisfying orientation. However, closure arrives as a convenience: the ghost simply dissolves "with a soft smile" after Elara completes her encoding, offering no visible cost or decisive change in her situation. The final paragraph's promise of "other ghosts" resets stakes rather than reconfiguring them. Under a Causal lens (the dominant reading given the because/therefore setup), the resolution lacks the earned constraint or price required for Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (servant, spire, elevator, diary). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara collects diary pages and clues across floors without because/therefore causality or situational pressure forcing stance. Closure arrives as epiphany—"her quest had never been about solving a mystery but about understanding her own heart"—but this realization lacks on-page cost; no option is foreclosed, no tactical shift visible. The final paragraph asserts warmth and purpose without demonstrating what she renounces or pays.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is declared but never tested on the page through a forced choice or visible cost. The "leap" and mystical immersion offer no causal tightening; Elara experiences a vision, then wakes to find the problem solved off-page (string replaced, gondola steady). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing in intent, but the cost is asserted rather than legible: no path is foreclosed, no tactical sacrifice made. Under a Causal or Hybrid lens, the because/therefore linkage from her theory to the leap to the restoration remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: Elara enters, finds the book safe, deciphers it, and completes the puzzle as the building collapses. One tightening occurs (the violent shudder), but the cost remains abstract—"the world seemed different" and "stillness remained" offer conceptual repricing without a legible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The closure reconfigures her understanding but does not foreclose a path or demonstrate visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens (decode symbols → follow beam → discover chamber → obtain map) and orientation anchors arrive early (airship, navigation chamber, Elara at work). However, the closure effect is a discovery without visible cost or foreclosed path—Elara gains the map and her journey "is just beginning," which defers the decisive change off the page. The beam appearing and the hatch opening feel coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening occurs (symbols → glow → beam → hatch), but the ending supplies triumph without a felt price, weakening the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece collects prophecy fragments, mirrors, and gears toward a thematic deepening. Orientation is delayed—"lunar-eclipse locksmith" and "frozen library above clouds" anchor role and place early, but what Elara is doing *now* (transcribing? searching?) becomes clear only in paragraph two, past the ~120-word threshold; apply −0.3. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (newfound confidence, steady ticking acknowledged), but cost remains asserted rather than legible: no on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off, only the claim "the weight of her purpose clearer than ever." The Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows what she gave up or lost to gain the gears.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens with heavy atmospheric description that delays anchoring who acts and when; Kael's entry arrives well past the first third. The plot moves through declarative summary—"they ventured," "they worked to clear"—without dramatized reversals or tightening choices. Closure is a convenience cascade: the bell rings, nebula returns, butterflies emerge, everyone gathers; no prior constraint is tested, no path foreclosed. No visible cost or renunciation lands on the page; the ending asserts miracle and unity without dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the puppet mends and the lighthouse beam steadies, crystallizing fragile hope. However, escalation is flat—Elara arranges fragments, hums, doubts, then succeeds without meaningful narrowing of options or a causal turn that tests her method. The "hush broke" line shifts pressure, but no prior beat forced a tactical choice. Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative drifting toward Causal at closure), the because/therefore linkage is weak. Cost is implied but not dramatized: no visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: nut discovery → impressions → map assembly → rescue → planting → bud. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first two paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (bud emergence), but the cost is diffuse—"the curse wasn't broken, but it was weakening" tells the shift rather than showing a visible price Elara pays or a live option she forecloses. The nut glowing "as if approving" and the ground trembling feel convenient rather than motivated by prior constraint, weakening causal tightness at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. The story operates in a reflective-accumulative mode, but no on-page event narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; Elena's "shift within her" is an interior declaration, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights prior material through action or image. The ending summarizes her readiness without demonstrating what she has renounced or what price she has paid on the page. Cost is asserted ("no longer a weight") but not dramatized, preventing closure from landing cleanly under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no anchoring "who" or grounding action; the opening prioritizes atmospheric description over spatial clarity. The closure—moonlight spilling onto blank pages, the library aligning—lacks visible cost or a legible before/after in Elara's options or knowledge; the transformation happens to the setting, not through her agency. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught only in retrospect and does not cohere with the causal setup of the vial quest. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the library "awakens" off-stage while Elara descends.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara descends, encounters memories, absorbs them, reaches the central shard, dissolves it. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the pavilion melts, her heart is lighter), but the cost is asserted ("a piece of her own sorrow") rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or visible consequence on the page. The pattern of descent → touch → dissolution is legible, yet the final image lacks the sharp before/after that would charge it decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, avoiding penalty. The closure unit—community reconciliation through song—occurs on the page, but cost remains vague: what did Elara forfeit or endure to achieve this? The astronomical clock's revival functions as metaphor rather than causal pressure; it responds to her voice without resistance or complication. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (song accumulates community voices), but the single tightening (clock awakens) lacks a visible price that would charge the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and why she is crouching in this canyon remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The dominant stake—resurrecting abandoned dreams through memory modification—is declared rather than tested on the page. No meaningful reversal occurs; the mirror modification proceeds without complication, and the final "portal" effect is asserted without causal setup or visible cost. Closure reads as thematic statement ("she understood her purpose") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The quest structure traces a clear path: grotto entry → inversion → navigation → pedestal → seed retrieval. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara retrieves the seed without forfeiting anything on the page, and her internal state at the end ("journey was far from over") defers rather than delivers a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat feels more like a beginning than a tightening that forecloses options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. However, the story lacks a meaningful escalation or tightening: Elara begins her work and completes it without reversal, complication, or narrowing of options. The "closure" is asserted—"the sculpture was complete"—but the reader cannot trace a decisive change in stakes, knowledge, or stance; the music was already "there, waiting to be set free" from the start, so no reconfiguration occurs. Accumulative/Textural lens is implied, yet no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with felt cost at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: silence → chess arrangement → nexus pulse → clarity → resolve. However, closure relies on told realization ("She understood now...") rather than an image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The worry stone and chessboard recur but their final meaning is asserted ("With the worry stone in her hand and the chessboard in her heart") rather than charged through a decision that alters options. The ending gestures toward change but the cost of returning—exile lifted, covenant challenged—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the "when" remains vague (fireworks "about to" ignite for the entire piece). The story presents as Causal but the clasp opens without prior resistance or failed attempts—no because/therefore linkage, just atmospheric buildup followed by success. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara feels peace, commits to carry forward the legacy), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no visible trade-off, forfeited option, or on-page consequence. The inferred lens (Causal) does not hold; the ending operates by declaration rather than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of present over ambition). Orientation anchors who and where early; the "turning of the tide's thought" timeframe remains abstract and never tightens decisions. The closure—Elara's shift to "lighter heart" guided by wisdom—lands thematically but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the journal entries "changing" is summary. The seed's aroma triggers insight, but the mechanism bypasses agency; the flower acts upon her rather than her wrestling with a choice the flower complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story presents a linear quest structure: retrieve artifact, follow river, reach grove, restore echoes. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but causality is driven by the arrow tip's convenience rather than protagonist choice—it pulses, flares, projects a map, and completes itself without Elara confronting a meaningful trade-off. The closure attempts Decisive Change (echoes restored, planet thriving), yet the cost is invisible; Elara presses the artifact into a groove and light erupts, resolving the problem the artifact created without forecloses a live option on her part. The lens reads Causal by intent but delivers outcomes via object magic rather than because/therefore linkage rooted in her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure is a thematic restatement ("the only way to ensure that the silence of the town would never be repeated") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—Elara's stance at the end is identical to her stance at the start. The investigation unfolds as accumulative discovery, but the final image offers mission-statement abstraction instead of reweighting prior material. No visible option was foreclosed or path renounced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what "unfetter the wonder" means concretely remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—"she had succeeded"—is declared rather than shown through a decisive change with felt cost; the sculpted hush materializes and Elara simply steps back in "quiet triumph." The causal chain is weak: the bells ring, the sheet glows, the hush appears, with no reversal, no narrowed options, and no legible price paid. The story reads as a ceremonial fulfillment rather than a plot with genuine pressure and cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive adequately (who/where/when by ~100 words). The closure unit—playing the flute and entering a new realm—occurs on the page but lacks felt cost; the "true challenge" declaration is postponed rather than paid. Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture, but the final beat telegraphs future difficulty instead of demonstrating present sacrifice or foreclosed option. The canyon-to-realm transition feels like a reset rather than a tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the piece toggles between causal gestures (touching the fragment) and lyric mood without teaching a pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph, waiving that penalty. Closure reads as a diffuse mood shift ("felt alive," "carried with him the faint glow") without a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. The "chaos within" and "expanding boundaries" remain abstract conceptual claims unsupported by on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately within the first third. The closure unit—Elara accepting that the pendant has "germinated within" her—lands on the page but cost remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The scholar's reveal ("It's been waiting for you") replaces causality with exposition. Drive lens reads Causal-Situational hybrid but the turn is told rather than earned through prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (quartz arbor, Elara, mist). The piece moves from experiment setup through communion to realization, accumulating sensory and thematic density. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the prism's beauty/sorrow duality reweights her original goal, and she commits to continued work. The cost is conceptual—humility, expanded scope—but lacks sharp on-page consequence that forecloses a prior path. The transition from theory to practice feels asserted more than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fragments → puzzle → bridge), but escalation is largely additive discovery rather than tightening under constraint. The bridge-of-light climax asserts transformation ("no longer unraveling but weaving itself into something new") without on-page dramatization of what Elara gives up or gains in concrete terms—her "sacrifice" remains an atmospheric label. Orientation is clean. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she steps forward into uncertainty), but cost is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal but linkage is weak: the silk's mechanics (how weaving into runes heals the planet) are unexplained, and the "awakening" trade has no on-page consequence. Orientation anchors who/where by paragraph one, waiving that penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("more and less himself") but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Eli lost or gave up at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts a hybrid lens but wavers between causal progression (shard → forest → woman → orb) and conceptual accumulation without teaching the pattern early. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive promptly, but the closure—Elara accepts guardianship—lacks visible cost; she "smiled, a sense of purpose filling her" erases rather than registers the weight. The causality chain is legible but the "cyclically spontaneous" shard mechanic is told in exposition rather than demonstrated, and the woman's convenient appearance short-circuits earned discovery. No meaningful tightening occurs; the repair bay becomes a nexus by declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story accumulates clues (sea glass, stones, letters) but the closure—lighting the lamp and declaring resolve—lacks a decisive change or felt cost that forecloses a prior path. The "luminescent ache" disappearing and being "replaced by a quiet resolve" is asserted emotional summary, not an on-page reconfiguration with visible price. The letter-chain mystery resolves through discovery rather than protagonist agency, and the final stance is told ("he knew what he had to do") without a concrete action or renunciation that makes before/after legible. Drive lens reads Causal-adjacent but linkage dissolves into declaration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "emerald lighthouse" and "stars" immediately but the Herald's name and role arrive mid-paragraph; who/where/when cohere only by ~150 words. The piece infers a Hybrid lens (causal setup yields to accumulative fog-reveal), but closure lacks felt cost—the Herald achieves their goal with no visible trade-off, and the "gateway" resolves rather than reconfigures. The final image (beings bowing, green dawn spreading) declares success without on-page price or a legible before/after in options or stance. A Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing requires undeniable pressure at closure; here the text asserts triumph without demonstrating friction or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but closure is a soft conversational exchange without visible cost or a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. The woman's choice to share her story doesn't foreclose a path on the page; Kael simply walks away feeling pulled to another thread. The ending summarizes his purpose rather than landing a decisive image. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalty, but the closure unit lacks the felt price required even for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlight and dream fragments coalesce toward a pattern-break moment. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the sextant heals, the labyrinth lightens—but cost remains abstract and conceptual ("sorrow made whole") without a visible forfeiture or decision that alters Elias's stance on the page. The ending declares transformation rather than dramatizing a decisive before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure gesture—Elara sings, dawn breaks, communities reunite—occurs on the page, but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture, trade-off, or renunciation that alters her state. The mirror-world journey offers scene variety but no meaningful causal tightening; each song fragment is retrieved without resistance. The ending summarizes fulfillment ("her task was complete") instead of showing a before/after pressure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story signals accumulative/textural intent but fails to deliver a closure unit with legible cost. Elara moves from curiosity to understanding to resolve across five paragraphs, yet the final image—leaving with "enlarged tranquility"—offers no visible trade-off, no path foreclosed, no reweighting of prior material. The invitation discovery, archive search, and chamber visit link by and-then sequencing rather than because/therefore causality. The "blank pages" reveal amounts to a thesis statement ("wisdom resides in seeking") that replaces scene pressure, and the ending summarizes her new stance without dramatizing the cost of carrying the legacy forward.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes setting and protagonist adequately but lacks a causal arc. Elara's discovery of the plaque and the bread's appearance are coincidental plot furniture rather than motivated beats that narrow options. The ending offers mood ("deep sense of peace") but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material—just confirmation of her existing belief. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the lack of meaningful tightening or pattern break at closure leaves the stakes unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors (frozen library, Elara, records chief) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the transformed slide and shifted inscription reweight Elara's role from preserver to conduit, and her renewed purpose forecloses passive archiving. Cost is felt—urgency clashes with meticulous nature—though the price could be more concrete. One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide's frequency spike and tremor force realization; escalation is modest but coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean by ~120 words (pirate market, Lila, moonshine runner's daughter, night). The drive lens reads as Causal with a situational accent: Lila seeks the thief, confronts the men, and walks away claiming to have "thwarted" them. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—she leaves with the fob still in her pocket, the thieves staring after her, and the truce holding "for now." The final paragraph offers conceptual repricing ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired"), but the cost is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or altered state. The before/after is legible but the felt cost is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (who/where/when established within opening). The piece attempts a Situational lens with mystical pressure, but the closure lacks felt cost: Elara's acceptance of her role as guardian arrives without sacrifice or renunciation on the page. The cloaked figure's exposition resolves her question through telling rather than earned discovery. One tightening occurs (the ring's taste shift leading to the clearing), but the final "step forward" does not reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memories, the lock, the note, and the painting accumulate toward a final image of liberation. However, the closure unit—Elara painting herself and placing the lock beside the canvas—lands as assertion rather than reweighted pressure; the cost is told ("chains she had shattered") rather than felt in a forfeited path or altered tactic. The discovered note ("You were meant for more") arrives as convenient permission rather than a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Causality is linear (map → undercity → chamber → inscription → water trickle), but the central turn—Elara's realization that the oasis was sacrificed—arrives via exposition ("She realized then") rather than through dramatized discovery. The closure gesture (inscribing conversations onto a new plate, chamber trembles, water echoes) suggests change, but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what Elara forfeits or how her world has tangibly shifted beyond hope as an emotional label. Lens reads as Causal, held adequately but without the tightening pressure that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure with cost. Elara begins tuning, completes the sculpture, witnesses a beautiful moment, then wraps up and departs—a sequence without reversal or stakes that narrow options. The "moment of wonder" arrives as spectacle, not as a consequence of her struggle or sacrifice. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after extensive mood-setting (~160 words), and the delay does not pay off at closure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative elements. The box discovery and miniaturization sequence provide a clear because/therefore chain, and the magnetic north shift functions as an inciting pressure. However, the closure—Elara's realization that she's "more android than caretaker"—feels told rather than dramatized through a decisive action or image that makes the cost undeniable. The cost (distant memories) is asserted in summary rather than shown through a specific on-page moment where we feel what she can no longer access. The ending lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Causal but the key linkage—locket warmth urging Clara forward—is coincidental rather than motivated. Mrs. Ellis's arrival and exposition resolve the mystery through convenient storytelling rather than Clara's agency. The closure ("Clara knew she had found more than a story; she had found a purpose") is a Conceptual Repricing claim, but no visible or felt cost appears on the page; reading a letter aloud does not foreclose options or impose sacrifice. Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) waived; causality and cost issues lower the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed past the first third: who Elara is, what specific knowledge she seeks, and why liberation matters remain vague. The "dance unlocks passages" beat reads as convenient rather than causal—no prior setup explains why dance decodes the journal or what cost she pays to perform it. The ending offers a declaration of mission completion ("would rise again") without an on-page decisive change or visible sacrifice; the closure is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, and when are not anchored by ~120 words; the opening stacks setting description and backstory before establishing present stakes (−0.4). Closure relies on summary assertion ("memories weren't lost; they were merely misplaced") rather than a decisive on-page change or renunciation with felt cost. The realm of floating memories is told, not dramatized, and the return to the chamber resets emotion without consequence. Drive lens unclear: the piece gestures toward accumulative patterning (wildflowers, coffee grounds, whale) but does not teach a legible pattern or pay it off with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early (who, where, when), avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, closure relies on assertion: "she smoothed the hush, sealing the prophecy within a silent void" summarizes the climactic act rather than dramatizing a decisive change with on-page cost. The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens through ritual description, but the final image ("the crane's wing glowed brighter… she felt a profound sense of peace") does not reweight prior material or crystallize a new cost—it simply declares success. The prophecy's threat is told, never tested, and the resolution lands off-page in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (rooftop garden, meteor shower, Clara) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Situational: Elias's arrival and lecture complicate Clara's stance, and the sugar-pouch handoff crystallizes a decision to engage neighbors and "listen to the walls." However, closure cost is faint—knocking on a neighbor's door the next morning carries minimal stakes or foreclosed options; the before/after is a polite social step rather than a transformation with felt consequence. The ending gestures toward a journey but does not land a decisive change or charged poise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who/where/when established by ~80 words). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (garden memory-archive metaphor deepening through sensory layering), but the ending toggles awkwardly toward Causal (she "weaves" memories into a tapestry, implying agency) without prior causal setup. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the garden reweighted as transformation-space rather than burial—yet the cost remains abstract: what exactly did Elara forfeit by accepting the archivist role, and how does that loss reshape her options? The metaphysical transition blurs causality (how does lifting the shell pull her into a timeless space?) and the return to the garden offers no on-page consequence that alters her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the blank scroll as new canvas) with visible symbolic cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip of stalactites, the aurora's glow, and the rose thorn's action build a meditative pattern that reweights forgiveness through image and gesture. However, the escalation is minimal—no reversal tightens options; Elara's decision to erase the scroll is signaled early and unfolds without resistance. The closure image (blank scroll, brightened aurora) lands cleanly but without felt friction or a second deepening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "where the universe hums its secret song" and "serpentine nexus" remain abstract metaphors past 120 words without spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4). The closure—Elara gazes into a pool, sees memories, receives an explanation, then walks away singing—delivers exposition rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The vision sequence tells the reader the answer ("echoes were not random but deliberate") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses options. No single inferred lens dominates by midpoint; causal momentum stalls in the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story presents a sequence of visions and dream fragments but lacks causal linkage: the baker's dream and the librarian's dream deliver exposition without altering Elara's options or tactics. The ending offers a glow and a whispered promise, but no decisive change in her situation or stance—no path is foreclosed, no felt cost paid. Orientation is delayed (candle-lit shrine location unclear until second paragraph; who Elara is addressing or what she risks remains vague), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight the dominant stake with visible cost; the globe "clears" and she "steps out," leaving closure as atmospheric assertion rather than earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early enough (Elara, parapet, post-rain, firefly season) so no orientation penalty applies. However, no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost occurs on the page—Elara begins seeking patterns, reflects throughout, and ends "feeling peace" without any choice, renunciation, or reweighting that alters her stance or forecloses a path. The structure is a single continuous meditative sequence (valid under accumulative lens), but the ending simply restates her initial motivation with no tightening or cadence shift that imposes cost. Closure cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence demonstrates a felt or conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elara Voss, a conspiracy debunker" mid-paragraph one, and the inciting premise (orchard investigation) competes with backstory ("after the liquidation") for opening clarity. The closure—diamond pressed into earth, stillpoint stabilized—lands as a physical act, but the cost is asserted ("fragile balance") rather than shown through a forfeited option or altered relationship. The lens reads Causal with convenience plotting: the chant and diamond conveniently solve the threat without prior setup of this method's mechanics or price.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The Drive Lens reads Causal but linkage is weak: the voice on the radio commands "unfold it," Elias obeys without on-page resistance or tactical constraint, and the portico fractures into light via passive construction. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "new beginning, shaped by his choices"), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown—no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the "bittersweet" weight is told, not dramatized. Escalation occurs but via summary visions rather than because/therefore pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery of captured sounds building toward a climactic music-box release. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias "finds his purpose"), but cost remains asserted rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture, failed alternative, or tactical constraint tied to the music box's autonomy. The shard break ("But the music box was not done") offers a micro-turn, yet the ending summarizes emotional arrival ("felt whole," "ready to translate") instead of landing a concrete image that makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece signals a causal lens but delivers a convenience resolution: the key glows and repels the threat without prior setup that Elara could wield it offensively. The figure's retreat is abrupt and unmotivated—no tactical adjustment by Elara, just the artifact solving the problem it did not help create. Closure lacks visible cost; Elara stands "alone" but her options and stance are unchanged from the opening. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when by the second paragraph), but the ending does not reconfigure meaning or foreclose a path with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece signals its lens as accumulative/textural but never delivers a decisive tightening or cost. Elara's "realization" atop the viaduct ("understood: the viaduct was not just a bridge but a metaphor") is told exposition, not a dramatized turn that narrows options. The ending claims transformation ("she had sculpted patience") without showing what was lost or foreclosed; there is no visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalty, but closure remains abstract and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, tunnel, investigating collapse) arrive early. The piece follows a causal chain: fissure → compartment → journal → symbols → hidden chamber → photograph, culminating in proof against the mentor. However, the closure—"she felt free" and a smile—asserts change without dramatizing visible cost; the mentor is not confronted, and no tactical path is foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads Causal through most beats, but the ending shifts toward thematic assertion without showing altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection, recurring images (music boxes, broken things), and Alistair's aphorisms rather than because/therefore turns. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias leaves "ready to face" the storm with the repaired heart. However, the cost remains abstract—"the weight of his task"—rather than a legible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The Alistair conversation delivers insight but does not narrow Elias's options or force a trade-off; Thomas's case and Elias's intended next steps exist entirely off-page, so the before/after boundary is conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear anchors (workshop, Lira, yearning algorithm). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images feed the kaleidoscope, a motif emerges, the bell materializes. The closure—ringing the bell and the world responding—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the algorithm's purpose reweighted as "awakening the world"), but the cost is asserted ("the journey was far from over") rather than felt in a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. The bell vanishes without leaving a dramatized consequence that alters Lira's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—"who" (Elara) and "where" (archive) emerge quickly, but the inciting event (the patch discovery) and its connection to her current task remain vague past 120 words, warranting −0.4. The closure unit—Elara stepping out with coordinates memorized—reads as a setup for future action rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost forecloses a path here. The causal lens is claimed (numbers → coordinates → decision) but key links are told in summary: "She realized the Echo-7 crew hadn't crashed—they'd been taken" offers insight without dramatized discovery or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is established early (lighthouse orchard, ice floes below, vintage store). The drive lens reads as Accumulative—mirrors reveal fragments that accrue toward reconstitution—but the closure lacks visible cost: the fragments simply "rise from their corners" by "unseen force," resolving the problem without Elara's sacrifice or trade-off. The final image (crystal ball glowing, light spreading) asserts unity but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure. One transition (orchard to store) is clean, but the reconstitution beat is coincidental rather than agency-driven, undercutting closure validity under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the marina setting and survivor stories layer atmosphere and thematic echoes toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's realization that "the sound of approaching endings...was a reminder to live"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. No causal tightening or tactical narrowing occurs; the ending delivers thematic summary instead of image-driven repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early enough to pass the orientation test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: reflection accumulates around the burned letter, vineyard symmetry, and pavilion light to reweight Elara's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift in stance: "destiny wasn't about finding the perfect match"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no on-page action is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The tightening is subtle (a deepening via metaphor) but lacks visible consequence that would elevate it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story declares an inciting condition ("after the prophet arrives") but never dramatizes a before/after change in Elara's options or the world's state. The consecration is performed without obstacle, and the prophet's arrival at the end delivers validation rather than closure with cost. No decision narrows a path or forecloses an alternative; the ending distributes praise and walks away, leaving no legible stakes shift. Orientation is serviceable, but the drive lens remains unresolvable—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pressure lands a closure unit with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes who/where/when adequately but lacks on-page closure with cost. Elara arrives, arranges photos, and departs; no decisive change, no visible price paid, no options foreclosed. The "masterpiece she sought to create" remains future-tense and abstract. Under a hybrid lens (accumulative aspirations without causal turns), the ending offers thematic assertion ("quiet hope") rather than a resonant reconfiguration rooted in dramatized pressure. The factory-vines image is visually appealing but does not reweight prior stakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when by the opening paragraph, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crystal's echoes coalesce into a pattern through layered detail rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias stands with the spent crystal, a seed for the future, and the final echo lingers. The cost—crystal spent, quest complete—is felt but somewhat abstract; the "bittersweet victory" is told more than shown in a concrete forfeiture or narrowed path.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the fog garden accumulates symbolic weight through repeated chalk-and-driftwood marking, and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias hears the sound and releases the chalk, reweighting his search with a quiet cost (letting go of the method). Orientation is anchored early (who, where, what he seeks). However, the escalation is thin—marking the ground and moving between sculptures does not meaningfully narrow options or raise stakes; the protagonist could have heard the sound at any sculpture. The cost at closure is implied (releasing the tool, accepting the ephemeral) but not viscerally felt on the page; the final image is more mood than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece attempts a resonant reconfiguration through the clock-hand metaphor and the leaf-falling motif, but the closure—Elara "learned to move with it"—lands as assertion rather than on-page cost. The tectonic shake in the opening promises physical stakes but never returns; the "device that expanded time" resolves the problem without dramatized struggle or trade-off. The final image reweights the premise conceptually, but the cost remains implied rather than legible in a decisive moment or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors setting and character early and follows a clear causal sequence: Elara identifies Mrs. Bennett's need, contacts Claire, facilitates reunion. However, the closure—warmth and quiet conversation—lacks visible cost or decisive change; the reconciliation is narrated as already accomplished ("their conversation quiet but steady") without on-page friction or a moment where options narrow. The lens reads as Causal, but the final image merely confirms success rather than reweighting prior material with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive adequately (floating isle, observatory, Elara) within the opening. The closure—shadows absorbed by a void during sealed awakenings—occurs on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; the key "felt heavy" is the sole gesture toward price, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The piece reads as Causal with some Accumulative layering (runes returning, loops closing), but the escalation is more procedural than pressure-driven. One meaningful tightening occurs (the void opens at noon), yet the final image does not reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: garden discovery → fountain encounter → symbolic exchange. The closure unit (stone drop, transformation, reweighted tooth) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than legible—what exactly did Elara give up by releasing her "belief in order and control"? The backstory about the substitute body and friend's theft arrives after the 50% mark and does not constrain present choices. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the maze "tests resolve" in summary, and the fountain figure grants wisdom without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and memory fragments around the polishing ritual, culminating in the sea glass glowing and Lira stepping out. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of her walking with glowing glass crystallizes her readiness to share light. However, the cost is implied rather than legible on the page: no visible trade-off, forfeiture, or consequence accompanies her departure. The orientation is adequate (grotto, Lira, sea glass by ~100 words), but the causality is thin—polishing simply succeeds, and the village arrival is asserted without obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the shared notebook moment, reweighting Elara's solitude into connection, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page—no choice is foreclosed, no option visibly narrowed. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (moss, icicle lattice, amber glow) and the final amber light callback attempts to charge the image, yet the ending feels like mutual comfort rather than a reweighted stance with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is vague: "feral nexus in mist" at a "forgotten shore" provides no who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Elara placing the fragment and beginning to write—lands on the page but the cost is asserted ("the mist lifted... she found her peace") rather than felt through forfeited options or visible trade-offs. Causal linkage is weak: the shell "begins to glow" and the tree appears without prior setup, reading as convenience rather than earned progression. The lens wavers between accumulative (collecting stories) and a late causal turn (placing the shell unlocks peace) without teaching the pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors are present early, but the drive lens never coheres: the piece gestures toward Causal (vine → song → remedy) yet delivers Accumulative mood without pressure tightening. The closure unit—glowing orbs suspended around Elara—is a Decisive Change by declaration only; no felt or visible cost appears on the page, and the "work is far from over" tag explicitly defers consequence off-page. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence shows what Elara has forfeited or risked to achieve this state.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately in the opening. However, no decisive change or visible cost occurs: Elara completes her task exactly as intended, experiences "quiet triumph," and packs up to continue her work elsewhere. The ending ("With the storybook illustration plate carefully packed away, she set off") is a soft reset that forecloses no path and imposes no felt consequence. The tremor and exhalation are decorative gestures, not causal or consequential reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening paragraph; marble cavern and Elias establish cleanly. The closure attempt—timer repaired, echoes harvested, peace achieved—reads as Decisive Change, but the causal chain compresses: "noticed that the broken timer's gears were aligned with the angles of reflection at dusk" is asserted discovery rather than earned through prior failed attempts or visible tradeoffs. Cost at closure is conceptual (wonder preserved) but not felt on the page as forfeiture or narrowed future; "knowing that wonder would never truly be lost" declares resolution without visible price. The drive lens reads Causal but linkage loosens at the pivotal breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens: the figure's arrival complicates Elara's stance, and her decision to "weave…her own" threads reweights the opening question. However, the closure moment—"began to weave not just the threads of others, but her own"—lacks a visible, felt cost; the lamp "burned brighter" reads as affirmation rather than foreclosure. The figure's "choice" offer sets up a turn, but the resolution is told rather than shown through a decisive act or renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The accumulative structure gathers density through the carving process, and the final image offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara recognizing both Marius and herself in the completed lion). However, the closure lacks a felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the ending delivers contemplative satisfaction without the friction required for high-band RR. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and it holds, but the final beat doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—"kinetic lagoon above the clouds" and "after the carousel halted" anchor setting and timeframe but provide no causal window or spatial grounding for 200+ words. The closure offers a tonal shift ("fractured stillness...felt like a beginning") but no decisive change in options or knowledge; Mara's stance crystallizes without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design (fragment collection, looping voice), but the ending reconfigures only via declaration rather than a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present (abandoned terminal, Eli alone, post-carnival timeframe) but the closure unit—Eli's realization that the terminal is a story and his departure with the sextant—lacks on-page cost or a legible decision that forecloses options. The terminal's "response" to his tinkering is asserted rather than causally demonstrated; the leap from mechanical adjustments to "living exhibit of possibility" is told, not earned. The drive lens wavers between causal (adjustments → change) and accumulative (atmospheric buildup), but neither delivers a decisive shift or felt price at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by paragraph one (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates pressure through layered memory, sensory detail, and the whispers coalescing into "bear," culminating in Elara's decision to complete the clock—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts coexistence of duty and dream with visible cost in her labor). The closure lands on the page with felt cost (hours of excruciatingly gentle work) and the sanctuary itself feels lighter, reweighting her relationship to confinement. One meaningful deepening (whispers → decision → completion) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but "when" remains vague ("quiet hours before dawn" becomes "first rays of sunlight" with no dramatized passage or pressure from elapsed time). The closure unit—Elara standing with journal and sundial as sunlight breaks—offers no decisive change, visible cost, or tactical foreclosure; she has salvaged a truth but the story does not show what she sacrificed, refused, or must now confront differently. Under a causal lens, the discovery sequence (walk → find barge → open chest → read journal → sundial glows) reads as linear acquisition without reversal or narrowing of options. The "warning, call to action, and promise of clarity" remains abstract assertion rather than on-page reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story presents a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchoring (dock, fog, snow). However, no meaningful causality links the beats: Elara examines rope, holds fulgurite glass, realizes the knots are "a map," then succeeds. The closure unit—"The ancient methods were safe, preserved for the future"—is an assertion without dramatized cost or visible change in her options or stance. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration but delivers only atmospheric description without a tightening or reweighting that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (traveler, shadowed garden, post-ship twilight) land early and remain stable. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, the thread-as-talisman motif, and the final exchange aim to reweight meaning. However, closure lacks decisive cost—the traveler receives a second thread and leaves "her journey far from over," which gestures toward continuation rather than a foreclosed path or resonant reconfiguration with felt consequence. The obituary-reading beat offers a micro turn but doesn't narrow options or alter the traveler's stance in a way that charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as causal with lyric undertones. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the vision and return to the palace, but the cost is asserted ("sacrifice, patience") rather than foreclosed on the page—no live option is visibly shut down. The machine's revelation and Kael's realization that "beauty could not be forced" feel like conceptual repricing, yet the final image of holding the egg restates hope without a legible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients clearly (village, lagoon, firefighter daughter) and follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara kneels, plants, whispers, and stands as the clouds shift. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (scars sing, she finds peace), but the cost remains abstract—no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered by the planting. The "graft might fail" acknowledgment tells us stakes exist but does not dramatize a price paid on the page. The ending reconfigures her internal stance but without a felt or conceptual price that makes a before/after legible with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. However, the closure operates under an unclear lens: the box mechanics shift from puzzle-solving (causal) to symbolic catalyst without teaching the pattern early. The final transformation—water flowing, memories released—reads as coincidental magic rather than motivated by Elara's prior choices; she assembles shards but the fountain's awakening and city-wide effect lack causal grounding in her actions. Cost at closure is conceptual (liberating memories) but not felt or visible on the page in Elara's options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first 150+ words with vague anchors ("heart of the nebula garden," "time before"). The drive lens remains ambiguous: accumulative phrasing ("colors swirled," "petals continued") suggests textural mode, yet the ending attempts a causal epiphany without prior because/therefore linkage. Closure reads as summary ("she had found her way") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The gear glows and the garden brightens, but no option is foreclosed and no price is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (butterflies, ribbon, greenhouse) and arrives at a quiet realization, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply "feels Tomas's presence fade" and walks away "lighter." The ribbon-as-migration insight appears suddenly without prior groundwork that would make it inevitable. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene window holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than image-charged pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through the final reverie. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via the acceptance of his expanded role), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page sentence makes a before/after legible with felt price. The escalation from noticing inscriptions to carving his own to influencing townsfolk is narrated in summary blocks rather than pressure-tested beats. The drive holds, but the closure unit lacks the sharp reweighting or visible forfeiture required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, what by paragraph one). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—Elias works methodically, discovers pattern, and gains understanding—but the ending unit offers no decisive change or reweighting with felt cost; he simply stores the case and continues his work "far from over." The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration only if we accept "forever shape his intentions" as Charged Poise, yet no options are visibly foreclosed and no price legible on the page. The causality inside the silo—thread-tracing to decode emotion—remains summary-level and does not narrow tactics or raise stakes. Without an on-page cost at closure, the RR form is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative but never coheres; the quill "moves faster" and "words begin to flow" without motivated linkage to prior stakes or his predictive models. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the warming lake image, but cost is absent—Ignorance departs unchanged, the scroll complete, the transformation externalized to "distant laughter" and future readers rather than a present forfeiture or renunciation. The ending asserts transformation ("The transformation had begun") without dramatizing what Ignorance lost or risked to seed it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Clara, attic room, after midnight) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: radio glow spreads, song fragments accumulate, room transforms from sanctuary to threshold. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "threshold" metaphor and Clara's resolve, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—she stands with "quiet determination" without visible forfeiture or altered options. The "thistled calm" giving way to determination is told, not shown through action or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (gallery, Elara, velvet pouch). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual scattering accumulates meaning through layered reflection and image. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Elara arrives decided and completes the act as planned. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via the final reflection on impermanence, but the cost is asserted philosophically rather than felt in a forfeited choice or altered tactic. Closure is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—preserve relics versus move forward—is signaled but never concretely tested; Kael follows Lira to the collapse with minimal resistance, retrieves artifacts offstage ("carefully extracted artifacts"), and the ending offers only a vague insight without visible cost or change in options. The piece reads as two loosely joined shards (sewer dialogue, then ruins expedition) connected by summary transit, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under a Causal lens—Lira's news does not narrow Kael's choices, and the collapse itself is backdrop rather than pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "threads in the same tapestry" line, but cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: hums intertwine, the choir grows in depth, the library transforms from silence to resonance. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the applause and hope replace discord, but no visible price or foreclosed option appears on the page. The final paragraph's "true victory lay not in the applause, but in the silence they had replaced" is asserted rather than shown through a decisive image or renunciation. One tightening occurs (the rehearsal ritual deepens), sufficient for this length, but the ending reads as affirmation without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, avoiding orientation penalties. However, the closure is a Decisive Change (planting → fruit harvest → sharing) that occurs almost entirely off-page: the fruit grows during Elara's meditation, she prunes the greenhouse in a symbolic interlude, and by dawn the tree is laden. The peak transformation—tasting the fruit and receiving its flood of memories—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and diffuse ("hope," "reminder") rather than a visible forfeiture or narrowed path. The celestial alignment functions as a deadline but does not tighten tactics; the seed sprouts "with unnatural speed" regardless of Elara's pruning work, breaking earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph, satisfying orientation. However, the closure unit—Elara touching the orb and receiving visions—delivers information rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final paragraph asserts that "truth would be revealed" and "wonder had been preserved," but no on-page action demonstrates this cost or change; the tower "humming back to life" is coincidental convenience. Under a causal lens, the linkage from riddle to key to chamber is mechanical but the ending substitutes declaration for dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (Elias, bay, dawn), but the drive lens is ambiguous: it gestures toward accumulative texture (collecting objects, spreading light) yet claims causal closure ("found his calling") without prior narrowing of options. The ending declares transformation ("felt a sense of direction") rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elias's knowledge state at the end is asserted, not earned through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (underwater garden, living statue, diver with ampoule). Drive lens reads as Causal-lite with situational overtones: Liora warns → Elara hesitates → adjusts serum off-page. The closure unit is a retrospective Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's gratitude sensed telepathically, Liora finding purpose), but cost is told rather than shown—"adjustments that accounted for its fragility" and the buried ampoule are summary gestures, not on-page forfeitures. The weeks-later epilogue format diffuses the final beat's immediacy, and the ampoule's structural weakness, introduced and resolved in a single telepathic exchange, lacks escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words, avoiding the penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the staircase, dice, and equations accumulate symbolic weight until the chipped die's loss triggers a shift. However, the closure—Elara's realization about letting go—lacks visible cost; she "continued her ascent, the weight...now light" without foreclosing a path or altering tactics on the page. The cost is asserted conceptually ("the rupture had occurred...within her") but not dramatized through a concrete action or forfeiture that changes her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece reads accumulative/textural: daydream sparks painting, painting intensifies into vision, vision completes at dawn. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara "feels a deep, saffron quiet" and "knows her work isn't done," but no option is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) is asserted rather than dramatized, undermining the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately but follows an and-then structure: Elara worries, bakes bread, the community gathers, tradition revives. No meaningful reversal tightens options; the honey and lens enable success without friction. The closure offers a Decisive Change (tradition spreads) but the cost is invisible—Elara's stated fear dissolves without on-page forfeiture or struggle. Orientation is clear; causality is present but lacks the pressure required to charge the ending under any inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraph. A clear causal lens operates: Elias initiates his plan, the yoyo mechanism unlocks the hunger stone, and the lighthouse transforms. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with the lighthouse running counter-clockwise, but the cost remains gestural—"there was no going back" asserts consequence rather than demonstrating a specific forfeited option or price paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone's glow syncs with his heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads Conceptual (fear as paradox), but the closure—"fear's weakness" revealed through acknowledgment—lacks felt cost on the page; the funhouse simply "fades" without consequence or foreclosed options. The conceptual repricing is asserted ("Fear is a paradox...dies in understanding") rather than dramatized through image or action. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what Clara loses or trades.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (restlessness replaced by "restless euphony"), but the cost is asserted rather than legible—no foreclosed path or visible trade-off appears on the page. The xylophone sequence accumulates sensory density and the clouds respond, yet the final image ("restless euphony that lingered in the air like a promise") delivers thematic claim without demonstrable consequence or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately and follows a causal chain (whistle → crack → tunnel → chamber → voice → new quest), but closure is deferred: Elara receives instructions and "began her next journey" rather than completing a decisive change or crystallizing a stance with on-page cost. The ending is a promise of future action, not a reconfiguration or repricing that reweights prior material. Cost is anticipated ("failure meant the end of Valtara") but not felt or paid on the page. The inferred lens is causal, but the final beat opens a new quest rather than resolving the gate question with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a linear quest structure—arrival, exploration, discovery, departure—with causal links intact (letter leads to station, riddle leads to key, key leads to archive). Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara gains understanding and "a little shallower" pit, but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice forecloses a concrete option. The lens reads Causal but the final beat lacks sharp bite.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias enters, discovers, repairs, and departs with a thematic reweighting at the mosaic reveal. The closure image—the glowing mosaic and calmer lagoon—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but delivers reassurance rather than cost; the "dreams would rise again" is assertion, not felt consequence. Causality is clean within beats, but no meaningful tightening narrows options or raises stakes; the repair proceeds unimpeded and the ending grants satisfaction without visible price. The "bridge between absence and memory" is thematic summary, not on-page reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the blackout's causal role and the library's spatial layout remain vague throughout (−0.4). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (truth revealed) but the mechanism is convenience (stamp activates hidden chambers) without prior constraint or cost. Evaluator infers Causal lens, but the and-then sequencing (notices patterns → finds map → presses stamp → chambers open) lacks because/therefore pressure. The "record of origins" appears via plot service, not protagonist agency with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens: mist, lanterns, origami cranes, and basilica light recur to build a pattern of grief-as-craft. Orientation anchors (floating island, workbench, basilica) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—unfolding the crane and deciding to honor grief—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: renunciation of escape with felt cost). However, the causal link between the crane-unfolding and the shift in stance is more symbolic than dramatized; the "realization struck him like a wave" tells rather than shows the cost through a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic. One meaningful deepening occurs (workbench → basilica → return), satisfying the length requirement, but the conceptual cost at closure remains more asserted than viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately and follows an accumulative/textural lens with the crystal observations building toward a realization. However, the closure relies on an assertion ("she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker") rather than a dramatized change or renunciation that forecloses a path. The cost is more stated than shown; we see Zara understanding potential but not what she gives up or risks to claim this new stance. One tightening occurs (external beauty to internal power) but the final beat summarizes rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece follows a linear treasure-hunt structure: three pieces are located and assembled without meaningful reversal or tightening. The ending projects a holographic map and Kael "understands" that the pieces were "fragments of himself," but this realization is told rather than shown through a decisive change with on-page cost. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing, yet the conceptual cost remains vague—"his place in the universe" is abstract and the final walk into the night defers consequences rather than landing them.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (terrace → shore → driftwood → watch alignment) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias commits to carrying truth forward. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page ("he couldn't undo what he had done, but perhaps he could stop adding to the lies"), but the cost remains somewhat abstract; the "fractured pieces of his own soul" metaphor tells rather than showing a concrete forfeiture. The watch-hand/carving alignment moment feels like manufactured symbolic convergence rather than causal pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (parapet, negotiator role, prisoner exchange). The piece commits to a situational lens—two figures under storm pressure crystallizing a stance—but the core beat (Elara's pitch, Kael's nod) lacks a meaningful narrowing of options or visible cost. The closure reads as thematic agreement rather than a Decisive Change or Charged Poise with undeniable pressure; the drawer pull passes hands, but no prior path is foreclosed on the page. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara or Kael sacrifices in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the compass–poles contrast reweights the dominant stake through reflection and a final image. However, the closure effect reads as Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change—Mara smiles and paddles on, crystallizing her new stance—but the cost is implied rather than undeniably legible on the page; she merely stows the compass without a scene-level forfeit or visible trade-off at the ending beat. The causality is motivation-driven rather than because/therefore linked, which fits the lens, yet the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp price that would anchor a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (underground lake, post-procedure, Elias alone). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elias observes, reflects, swims deeper, surfaces with altered perspective. However, the closure—"empathy wasn't something to kindle; it was something to carry"—is declared rather than demonstrated through a decisive choice or visible cost. The baseball's sinking and the lake's symbolism support thematic resonance but do not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (Elara, orchard, post-phoenix moonlit world) but the drive lens remains ambiguous—neither strict causality (the fortune cookie guides passively), nor accumulative texture (no cadence shift), nor situational crystallization (the guardian solves rather than complicates). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara "reconnects to her own power," but the cost is asserted not shown—no foreclosed path, no visible sacrifice on the page. The phoenix-reset framing device bookends without integrating into the central action. The conjuring moment lacks concrete consequence; the guardian's transformation is described but doesn't alter Elara's tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes orientation (cartomancer in midnight glade) and pursues a coherent stake (reclaiming lost moments). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crack shifts from wound to reminder, and Elara's stance crystallizes into a promise of presence. However, the cost remains conceptual and untested on the page—no concrete forfeiture or tactical change results from her vision. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric density building to a reweighted image), but the middle sags into exposition about the nephew and family custom without on-page pressure tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words, meeting the baseline test. The dominant stake—unlocking the dimension for humanity's survival—is declared early, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Elara completes her stitching, the dimension awakens, and she steps back into her ship "ready to guide humanity" without forfeiting a path or facing a trade-off on the page. The piece gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration ("for the first time in centuries, the future felt possible") but the final image is aspirational rather than reweighted by loss or constraint. The lens reads as loosely Causal with Accumulative/Textural touches (stitching motif, tear shimmer), but the ending does not land a decisive reconfiguration under either.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid; orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within opening paragraph. The detour constitutes a beat, but causality is weak—the hush "urges" her away from the volcano without dramatized resistance or cost. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the lightning bug release and cosmic message, but the cost is asserted ("texture of transformation... rough and alive") rather than shown through forfeited options. The prophetic fulfillment and celestial alignment function as coincidental staging, not protagonist-driven turns.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: blackout → investigation → key discovery → confrontation → activation. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara "slips back into the shadows" with her revolution begun, but no on-page consequence alters her options or stance. Thorne's silence and the inhabitants stirring constitute a promising shift, yet the final image of Elara's quill holder "glinting in the light" offers symbolic recurrence without decisively reweighting her situation or foreclosing a path. The cradle's activation resolves the blackout conveniently, and no visible price is paid within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The sequence unfolds—rocks placed, dust scattered, aurora surges—but the escalation reads more as a checklist than causal tightening. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding the eternal patterns), yet the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page; Kael smiles and walks away with "heart alight," which undercuts any visible forfeiture. The shifted rock pattern at the end gestures toward continuation but doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure lacks visible cost: Elara begins to write with "freedom," but no prior scene establishes what was risked or lost by remaining censored, so the transformation reads asserted rather than earned. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and basic situation require assembly across the first two paragraphs without early anchoring (−0.4). The causal link from envelope arrival to "call to return" to writing is summarized rather than shown through on-page choices that alter tactics. The lens reads Causal by intent but executes as static revelation without because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who and where early, satisfying orientation. However, no decisive change occurs on the page—Elias's closing thought ("questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves") is asserted philosophical musing, not a reconfiguration earned by prior causality. The "duel" consists of abstract exchanges with no narrowing of options or felt cost. The lens reads as intended-Causal but collapses into static dialogue without because/therefore linkage or agency-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the library becomes a "sanctuary," poems accumulate on walls, and the ending gestures toward reconfiguration. However, the closure unit is purely declarative—"they knew they had forged something beautiful"—with no on-page cost or visible before/after pressure. The coffee tin's false bottom and the grandfather's letters arrive mid-story but function as backstory exposition rather than altering present tactics. Orientation is clear (vagrant poet, rusted library, evening/night), but the lack of a legible cost at closure prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (seeking hidden film fragments, memory montage, symbolic objects), but the closure relies on a convenienct magical fix: the clock ticks, compasses still, and Elara plays a "new song" without visible cost or renunciation. The film-reel sequence summarizes memory vignettes rather than dramatizing a choice that narrows options. Orientation is anchored early (arbor, bench, piano), so no penalty there, but the ending asserts transformation ("embrace fate," "new song") without showing what path she foreclosed or what she sacrificed to earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Causal but linkage is thin: Elara seeks seed → finds seed → plants seed with minimal complication. The creature's test resolves via a single philosophical answer with no prior struggle to earn it. Closure occurs on-page (seed planted, memory preserved) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible price paid, no tactic altered, no path foreclosed in the final image. The monsoon's threat never materializes as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: compass settles, lace instructions diffuse, letters dissolve, creating a tonal arc toward release. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise): Elias releases regret via the ritual of reading and dissolution. Cost is declared ("the color of unspoken apologies... was not something to be found but something to be released") but the price—what Elias forfeits or what tactics changed—is not dramatized; the insight arrives as summary rather than a visible trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (reading letters → ocean absorbs sorrow), but the path from discovery to resolution feels telescoped without on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Plot follows a causal lens with coherent linkages; closure is a decisive change where Lira feels a shift, landing with cost under the moonlight image. Orientation is clear early, and the jar's essence reconfigures her path, but the cost, while felt, lacks sharp conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara places the bookmark in a sphere, symbolizing a turning point with felt cost; the Accumulative lens holds through patterns of thawing and abandonment. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the bookmark shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Plot follows a causal lens with clear orientation and a decisive closure where Elara unites the seashell halves, shattering false selves. The cost is legible in the mirror cracks and her transformation, and the structure tightens meaningfully. No causality breaks, but the climax relies on a convenient hidden compartment, slightly softening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise with cost (the last star vanishing), under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the dimming star shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens, with the violin inciting a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Unit-7 realizes its interconnectedness, with cost legible in the "quiet certainty" and shifted perspective. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot coheres through Elias's reflective actions, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where he accepts the beauty of flaws. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the final image of the marble's glow mingling with fading light. The drive lens holds without ambiguity, and orientation is anchored early, though the inciting incident (finding marbles) relies on mild coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (station destabilization, newfound responsibility), and the causal lens holds tightly through because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of risk shapes the final image of her ready to face consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira becomes the silence, costing her old self but deepening her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: experiments with the dust gradually escalate from observation to responsive patterns to the re-formed butterfly, giving an accumulative arc. Causality is soft but legible—her repeated use of dust and attention to patterns precede the emergence, and the closure beat is clear. The stakes remain small-scale and conceptual, and there’s little sense of risk or cost beyond a quiet repricing of her priorities. Still, the narrative feels complete and properly cadenced for its scope.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ambush → discovery of the strip → decision to retrace → frost-reading journey → grotto revelation → renewed resolve. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, with one main shard transition (campfire to following the trail and back). Closure lands as a knowledge and stance shift when she learns who funded the attack and that the apprentice is alive, and she commits to a plan. The cost and narrowing of options, however, feel conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene arc: solitary struggle → new data from Kael → night-long collaboration → conceptual shift at dawn. Causal and accumulative links are clear, but the central “experiment” is mostly summarized (“they worked through the night”) rather than dramatized, softening structural impact. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—revaluing silence itself—without breaking any established rules. The lack of a concrete, on-page setback or cost at the peak keeps this at strong-but-not-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: package → library search → finding fragments → reassembly → signal sent → surface response. Structure fits a single-POV, one-arc short story and closure is clear (the city’s distress finally answered, Elias internally reconfigured). However, the fragment hunt is summarized rather than dramatized, so the middle lacks textured turns or complications. The cost of success (what he risks or forecloses) remains largely abstract, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: midnight runs, accidental discovery, rumor, declaration of a gathering, communal response, and a quiet resolved ending. Causality holds under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens; the widow’s spotting her is a tidy but acceptable inciting turn, leading to Mara’s new tactic of open organizing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the community’s identity shifts from sanctioned isolation to chosen unity, with Mara relinquishing anonymity. The cost of that shift (personal risk, burden) is more implied than dramatized, which blunts the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dream → visit to viaduct → spark → pendant → alcove → Kwan Yin → internal reconfiguration. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph and the piece adheres to a single coherent scene. Closure lands as a decisive internal change plus a resolved quest question (she learns where unused love is stored), but cost is low because no attempt fails and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The magical mechanics (spark-guided path, pendant fit) are convenient yet legible within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—fragment found → maze entered → pedestal reached → fragment disintegrates → temporal vision → aftermath—is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. Closure is present: Elara emerges changed, with restored ancestral narratives and a maze that has “spent” its power. However, the path through the maze reads more like a guided rite than a pressured sequence of decisions; the hyperbolic geometry and shifting paths never quite demand tactical adaptation. The structure works but feels somewhat schematic rather than deeply earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causality is clean: clue → piano → vault → seeds → chase → escape, with the ticking wall providing a coherent spine and a visible before/after. Closure is decisive (the seeds are rescued; the wall collapses; the mission reframes into planting) but the price is light—no real sacrifice beyond strain. The chains falling away “as if they had never been there” feels convenient and under-motivated. Still, orientation is solid and the structure is orderly and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive with a goal, gather an “absence,” use the forge, experience the sought-after sound, then reinterpret it. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens, with each step naturally flowing from the last and no orientation issues. Closure is on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—her understanding of the sound and of the ruins around her distinctly shifts, with emotional cost legible in her trembling and ache. The arc is straightforward rather than intricate, but it’s well-shaped and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is clean: infiltration → coded trap → rearranged flowers → Elara reveal → revelation about the jar → handoff → exit with new resolve. Structure is straightforward and coherent for the length, with a single scene and one central object driving events. However, the supposed trap dissipates without consequence, and Elara’s quick willingness to yield the jar softens any sense of hard-won resolution. Closure exists (Lira leaves with the jar and a new stance) but with minimal felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → work with glass → reflection on control/abandon → symbolic act with the bookmark → departure. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure beat (sealing the bookmark in a sphere and leaving) gives a clear before/after shift in stance, with a felt conceptual cost. The dominant drive is internal and thematic rather than event-driven, and escalation is modest, which keeps the piece from feeling fully like a high-stakes turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: seashell → attention to cast → deciphered notes → hidden key → locked door → mirror room → reunited shell → revelation about her identity. The piece maintains single-scene coherence in the library with no orientation issues, and the closure—a decisive internal reconfiguration—is legible. The off-stage “enemy” and the mechanics of the betrayal remain vague, softening the sense of external consequence. Still, structure and drive are sound for this length, with one clear tightening as she moves from puzzle-solving to confronting the mirror room.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure—four embedded stories shaping a “map” of night—reads cleanly, with a clear before/after: the oracle has taken a step toward their project as the last star goes out. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: oracle waits for one star, opens booklet, retells stories, reaches a charged final image. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid, but the cost is largely conceptual, not dramatized. There’s no major structural stumble, yet no strong mid-story turn that meaningfully alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: robot in courtyard → encounters violin → plays it → undergoes looped timelines → emerges changed. The piece lands a clear Conceptual Repricing closure, reinterpreting “thought” and identity in the final paragraphs. However, the “second chance program” and its costs are mostly explained rather than dramatized, so the structural stakes feel faint. The arc is coherent and complete but formally safe and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: Elara’s unease → focus on the ticket/lens → decision to draw and offer her doodles → Kian’s response and relational thaw. Single-scene structure with one clear turn (her decision to act) and a quiet but definite closure moment works well for the length. The cost of failure is mostly implied emotional discomfort, so while closure is present, the stakes never feel sharply pressured. Orientation and timeline are always clear.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: finding the marbles → deciding to polish them → ritualizing the act → final placement and realization. Causality under a textural lens holds, and closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration as he reinterprets cracks, garden, and self. The before/after is legible and the cost—his life’s doubts and labor—sits beneath the final scene. It could climb higher with one sharper mid-story turn or complicating beat rather than an even, meditative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: calibration attempt → lever pull → overload → near-failure → second adjustment → stabilization and data confirmation. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear inciting act and resolution plus a recognizable Decisive Change/RR at the end. The main weakness is cost: the station nearly collapses but reboots neatly, and the temporal anomaly is brief, so the threat feels undercashed. As a result, the closure is solid but not powerfully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear throughline from discovery of the program to the ghost’s release, and a legible before/after state for Clara and the opera house. Causality in an accumulative/lyric mode holds: patterns → melody → humming → ghost’s composition completes and she vanishes. Closure is on-page but the cost is soft, framed as peace and inspiration rather than a difficult trade-off. No major gaps or disorientation, but the arc feels somewhat pre-ordained and low in surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: quiet contemplation → hallucinatory slippage → intrusion of the wanderer → a reframed stance toward the “swallowed truth.” Under an accumulative/textural lens, the motifs (station, illustration, smudge, margins) build coherently to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is modest but sufficient: the fever’s aftermath leads her here; the smudge and the wanderer’s words catalyze the reconfiguration. The main limitation is that the consequences of this shift remain mostly conceptual; the cost is implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is clean: father’s stories → interpreting his calls → entering the tunnel → discovering the valve → freeing the ghost shift, with clear spatial and temporal orientation. Closure is decisive—she activates the machine, releases the souls, and gains internal peace—but the resolution feels mechanically neat and low-cost. The valve’s function as “release key” appears late and works almost too perfectly, edging toward convenience rather than earned problem-solving. Structure is competent for a single-scene arc but lacks a meaningful complication beyond simple progression inward.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: the swan’s activation → map → journey → mirror → return forms a coherent causal chain under an accumulative/lyric lens. Orientation is solid early (who/where/what she does), and the shift into the mirror’s visions is legible and returns us to a clear after-state in the library. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: Lira’s stance toward change and silence is altered, journals are mysteriously filled, and the refuge is erased with a conceptual cost. Some crucial beats (e.g., the mirror experience) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts the impact of the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single continuous scene with a clear causal spine: eclipse → meeting Finn → shared ritual → internal shift. Closure is legible as a before/after in Finn’s stance toward wonder and in Elara’s reframing of the curl’s meaning. The main weakness is the softness of cost—nothing is truly at risk beyond a subtle emotional stake, so the decisive change lands more as gentle repricing than hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: diaries → discovery of tapestry’s secret → scrolls → ritual → restoration of dreams. Structure is linear and clean, with a clear before/after in the world, so closure lands. However, every step presents itself conveniently with no real setback, resistance, or uncertainty; problems solve as soon as they’re named. The lack of complication or meaningful price keeps the structure feeling more like a synopsis of a myth than a fully dramatized plot.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is essentially linear and legible: Li Wei writes fortunes, encounters/uses the specs, experiences a shift, and commits to journeying to the lighthouse. The drive feels Accumulative/Textural, with images (kitchen, microdot specs, lighthouse, fortunes) layering toward a final stance rather than sharp causal turns. Closure exists in the resolved intention to embark on the journey, but the cost of that decision is barely sketched—no concrete sacrifice or opposing force tests it. Repetitive thematic restatement (“open secrets,” “orchestrate fate”) substitutes for stronger structural tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal through-line is clean: looming possession → priest interrogates assumptions → possession weakens and dissolves. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and closure (the possession’s defeat via exposed assumptions) is legible. However, the resolution comes without complication or setback; each move works on first try, keeping pressure modest. Cost at the end is conceptual rather than dramatically felt, which holds this out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: nautilus → inscription → approach of dawn → activation of harp → symphony → collapse forms a clear progression with a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is gentle but intact; each step grows out of the last without arbitrary jumps. Closure lands cleanly as the writer sacrifices themselves to become the conduit for the unheard symphony, with the horizon image reweighted. Stakes could be articulated more concretely on the page, as the “clock” of exhaustion rarely forces a visible tactical adjustment before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clear and coherent: tablet → branching viaduct → tour of alternate selves → convergence → reframing realization. Closure is present as a conceptual repricing (the labyrinth as something to embrace), but the journey reads more like a guided tour than a pressured sequence of turns. Causality is functional—tablet pulses, she follows, revelations intensify—but stakes rarely feel imperiled, so the decisive change lands more intellectually than viscerally. There are no orientation issues, and the accumulative pattern is easy to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: broken needle → recalled legend → decision to attempt backward songs → extended process → emotional reawakening. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main throughline and a clear before/after visible at the tear and her step outside. Closure qualifies as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she reinterprets “hush” and chooses to live in it differently, with cost framed as embracing raw feeling. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and there are no noticeable causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clear and easy to follow: tube → message → investigation → discovery of the quarantine zone → confrontation → new resolve. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one main temporal throughline and a legible inciting incident and closure, with no orientation problems. However, major beats (tracking the follower, infiltrating an active guarded compound, the scale of the threat) are handled with convenient ease and light resistance, which flattens the sense of hard-earned progression. Closure is present but the path to it feels somewhat schematic and under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: receiving the vial → extended avoidance → succumbing to the pull → memory sequence → conceptual shift → deliberate grieving, with the vial as the through-line. The greenhouse/hospital/childhood shards are clearly anchored and easy to follow, and the return to the shop lands as a coherent closure unit. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and the final act (uncorking) is a clear Decisive Change with cost. Structure is conventional and solid rather than surprising, but there are no real orientation or logic debts.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: grotto → patterns/rope → alcove/mirror → choice to leave the rope. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of time (“not a thing to discover, but a poem to write—and rewrite”) and a concrete relinquishment. The cost—leaving the rope, accepting a new stance toward time—is present but understated, more reflective than pressured. Structure is solid and legible, with no causality breaks, but the decisive change feels emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: aftermath of fire → discovery of the bowl → decision to play → story-telling → reframed relationship to the hush, yielding a clear resonant reconfiguration. Structure is straightforward single-scene with light backstory that’s well anchored and doesn’t confuse orientation. The cost at closure is modest but legible in her accepting the hush as muse and leaving the bowl as a charged relic, and nothing breaks causality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the grotto, setup of the petal and commission, execution of the emotional crafting, and exit with a quiet coda about Kael. Causality is intact—each step follows from Elara’s goal and the nature of the object—and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with a textural overlay. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she has completed the transformation and reaffirmed her stance on half-truths, with a subtly altered emotional register in the final image. However, the cost of this closure is understated, and escalation feels modest, so while structurally sound, it doesn’t reach the sharpness expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: symphony → found envelope → reading letter → writing back → epistolary friendship → meeting at the library. Structure is cleanly segmented into inciting incident, reflective planning, and payoff, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration—the mistaken letter births a friendship and recontextualizes the locket—but the lack of any serious obstacle or complication keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a high-literary level. The “because/therefore” links are present, but risk and consequence stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: arbor → tag discovery → decision to search → shared quest building bonds → encounter with Echo → re-reading of her place in the web. The months-long search is summarized but legible, keeping orientation and drive intact. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the Echo tag on her sculpture reweights all prior searching as communal weaving, with emotional cost implied in her long vulnerability and effort. Echo’s appearance is a bit convenient and brisk, softening the sense of earned inevitability that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: pendant warmth → canal journey → gate → cavern → insight → return, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—her relationship to time and her art is reconfigured—yet the cost is modest (she simply cannot stay because the “giant’s nap” is ending, which never becomes a live on-page crisis). The structure is straightforward quest-and-return without a strong tightening beat beyond the initial commitment. It works, but the stakes and consequences feel light relative to the grandeur of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the eyes → recognition of pattern → decoding → journal revelation → integration of research → breakthrough, all under a single POV and coherent timeline. The drive lens is primarily causal with thematic coloring, and the closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing—she reframes the “mathematics of emotion” from control to harmony. The main limitation is that the warned-of danger never meaningfully constrains or complicates her tactics, so the cost at closure remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatically felt. Still, structure is solid and immediately legible for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is straightforward and legible: find fragment → search deeper → assemble cache → receive message and conceptual shift. As an accumulative/textural piece, the pattern of discovery is clear and the closure (reframing visibility as being heard/remembered) is on the page. However, the causal stakes are modest and nearly nothing obstructs or complicates the process, so each step feels like a gentle continuation rather than a pressured turn. The cost of the protagonist’s risk is stated but never tested in scene, keeping the closure relatively low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: we open grounded in place and season, the linden leaf functions as inciting catalyst, the storm peaks as she physically reorders the nursery, and the ending lands on a clear stance shift. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the pressure is mainly atmospheric and internal, and it coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her relation to control and the nursery is definitively reweighted with a felt cost (loss of her old safety strategy). Some transitions (“She knew what she had to do”) are a bit expository, slightly softening the causal sharpness of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: storm → rain trails → ruin → brooch → map → cove → exchange → new role, with no orientation problems. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elara reframes herself from failed painter to “keeper of stories,” and the world (the island as archive) is reweighted. The cost, however, is lightly implied—there is no concrete sacrifice or lost option; it reads more like an opening to a larger narrative than a self-contained arc with a sharpened price. Structure is straightforward but coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain—arrival, discovery of the pearl, touch, inhabiting the cave, realization, return—is clean and easy to follow, and the story lands on a clear before/after shift in her understanding (a Conceptual Repricing). The closure is solid but low-cost: becoming guardian and reframing her power happens without sacrifice, danger, or hard trade-off, so the decisive change reads more like a bestowed upgrade than an earned resolution. Structure is linear and appropriate to length, but relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: search → artifact discovery → valve activation → apparition → acceptance of role, with a coherent causal chain. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning causal; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Elara’s role and the harbor’s meaning are recast. The cost—shouldering a vast task, stepping into a lineage—is implied but not strongly dramatized, which softens the impact. Orientation is solid from the opening, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious object → research → midnight station → arrows → fortress → inner test → punched ticket → return with altered stance. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after reconfiguration when she chooses to punch the ticket. Closure is on-page and conceptually legible, though the “test” in the fortress resolves rather quickly and mostly via exposition rather than dramatized struggle. Some conveniences (the world literally rearranging to point her way) flatten potential complication but don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain—finds tile → dreams → tower → visions → reframed life—is clean and easy to follow, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her life and worldview, but the stakes and cost attached to that shift remain modest and mostly asserted. The middle beats (dream, first transcription) feel like sequential steps rather than escalations of pressure. Structurally sound but conventional, with little surprise or structural risk.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: boredom → discovery of fragment → experimentation with magnetic fields → escalation of storm and reality strain → shattering and internalization of power → reconfigured purpose. Closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he ends with a new stance toward his immortality and a clear forward drive, with implied peril. However, costs remain mostly conceptual and gestured-at (“consequences he couldn’t yet comprehend”) rather than dramatized in specific losses or altered options. Structurally it’s solid and coherent, but it stops just short of landing a fully felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward: Clara waits, encounters the ink pot, experiences a mental shift, confronts her father, and they decide not to run, giving the piece a clear before/after. Closure qualifies as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration in their shared plan and relationship. However, the cost of this decision (legal danger, practical fallout) remains abstract, which blunts the impact of the structural turn. The single-scene frame is clean and coherent, but the asylum premise never truly tightens options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a night of work, a spike in the hum, a singular intense recording, and a quiet descent. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the strengthening hum and coalescing story serve as the one meaningful deepening, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—this experience has altered her sense of her work. Cost and consequence remain fairly gentle and conceptual, and the stakes never truly bind her options. It’s coherent and finished, but not dramatically charged enough for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure follows an accumulative/textural lens: wandering, finding objects, then discovering the archive container and reframing the mission. Orientation is clear from early on—port city, container maze, single POV—and the progression from clue (poison label) to discovery (archives) to conceptual closure is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the wanderer redefines their role and re-prices remembering itself, but the cost of that realization is more implied than sharply dramatized. There are no major causal breaks, yet the story leans more on atmospheric accumulation than on a tight chain of pressure-filled turns, limiting structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene arc that moves from approach, to experiment (playing the cello), to realization, with no orientation issues. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens: music → environmental/psychic shift → insight. Closure is a conceptual repricing of the “ephemeral compass” that clearly marks a before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that consequences remain abstract; the price of this new stance isn’t strongly foregrounded in concrete future implications.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is legible: stone → graffiti trail → revelation of founding vows → organizing resistance → Festival of Lights as turning point. Much of this, however, is summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation and the mechanics of opposition (what Vorin concretely does, what’s at risk moment-to-moment) remain abstract. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the community reclaims its narrative and stance, with the fight framed as ongoing. The cost of that stance is only lightly implied, so the before/after line is conceptually clear but not sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: assignment → discovery of the timed message → recognition of the mentor → decision to stay through dawn → documentation complete → departure. The story achieves an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure, with a clear before/after in Elara’s stance toward her role. However, the terraforming threat and mission-control pressure stay abstract and offstage, so the climactic choice never feels structurally risky. The drive lens (primarily causal with accumulative mood) holds, but escalation is modest, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a simple causal line—broken drone → detailed repair → successful return—within one continuous scene, and spatial/temporal anchors are clean. The inferred lens is largely accumulative/textural, culminating in a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s work is likened to an anchor amid motion. However, there is no genuine turn in options or knowledge: no real risk that the repair might fail, no complication from the crowd or ship, and no visible cost to her stance. Closure exists but feels more like a graceful fadeout than a decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: falcon returns → condensation image primes her attention → she goes to the lake → discovers the warm current and mist → follows it to the fissure and source → reinterprets her quest via the phrasebook. The piece delivers a clear before/after in knowledge and stance, with a resonant final image that reconfigures her life’s work. However, the path is almost frictionless, with no meaningful setbacks or uncertainties, which keeps the structure from feeling fully charged. Still, orientation and closure are solid and coherent under a causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean and linear: archway setup, repeated walking ritual, gradual changes, then the bell’s return as closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the routine builds toward the bell sounding, but escalation is more told than felt, and opposition is absent. The final change (town reawakened) is decisive but largely cost-free and arrives almost on schedule once enough time has passed. Still, orientation and causal coherence are solid, and the closure beat is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward—cave-in → trapped → discovers vial → accesses memories → deciphers temple → finds way out—but the steps are summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens escalation. The distress signal and oxygen limit are set up as stakes but never meaningfully constrain later action or the ending. Closure technically occurs with Maya’s internal repricing of survival vs discovery, yet her survival and escape feel frictionless once the vial appears. The drive lens reads as causal, but the “because/therefore” links lack resistance, and the final beat lands with little on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: door → descent → journal → revelation → ascent and new stance, with no orientation issues. Closure is a decisive change in stance (rejecting the hush) rather than an external resolution, and that works for this length. However, the ticking clock “before they found the bodies” never meaningfully constrains or redirects on-page choices, so the external stakes feel underused. The cost of his decision remains mostly conceptual rather than concretely pressed in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: present-time bead awakening framed by selective backstory, leading to a clear closure beat where she steps out with a new, charged purpose. Causality is coherent—finding and burying the bead → current awakening → arrival of other spirits → decision to move into the night under a redefined sense of debt. The closure is a solid Charged Poise/RR: the greenhouse reframes from prison to threshold, with the cost of facing collective pain implied. Escalation is modest and somewhat conceptual, so the arc feels more like a deepening than a sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural progression where Elara’s continued work slowly transforms the canyon, and the closure (canyon “exhales,” aura shifts to hope) is legible as a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is simple but coherent: she walks, sews stories, and the environment changes accordingly. However, pressure barely tightens, and there is little sense of options narrowing or tactics evolving in response to obstacles. The result is structurally sound but dramatically soft, with cost and decisiveness only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: Elara wanders, finds the sundial base, follows the roots’ guidance, discovers the tomb, uses the object to open it, and arrives at a new internal stance. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration—her relationship to faith and ancestry has clearly shifted. Yet escalation is soft; obstacles are nearly nonexistent and the “weeks” of excavation are compressed into summary, so the finding of the tomb feels inevitable rather than earned through hard choices. The causal chain is intact but dramatically underpowered for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: decode chalk → locate mailbox → retrieve/read letter → internal reweighting. Causality is intact but soft; nothing meaningfully pushes back on her goal, so the ticking clock feels more declared than dramatized. Closure lands as a quiet conceptual shift (valuing what’s “before a letter is mailed”), but the cost of that realization is faint. Stronger on orientation and coherence than on driving turn.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: embroidery → flame anomaly → visitor knock → revelation of the conspiracy → decision to act via the chart. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with Elara’s role redefined and the chart completed as a guiding tool. However, the middle leans heavily on explanatory dialogue and the final “we worked through the night” montage elides concrete obstacles or consequences. As a result, the structural arc feels solid but low-pressure, with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → condensation messages → map → pedestal → unsent letter → reading and internal shift, all under a stable lens that leans accumulative with a clear causal spine. Closure is solid: reading the letter and choosing to heal constitutes a decisive internal change with a visible before/after in her relation to regret. Structure is straightforward single-POV, single throughline with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that obstacles and alternatives are minimal, so the path feels fated more than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative, single-scene structure: study of the cast → emerging meaning → decision to act with the decrypted notes. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a new, committed role. Causality is soft but coherent (as she deciphers more, her sense of obligation clarifies), and there are no orientation issues. The arc is more meditative than driven, so options don’t visibly narrow so much as mood and understanding deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: muralist in ruins → fresco fragment → path → stone table/film → search for network → projection → renewed art, with no orientation issues. The structure is linear and legible, and closure lands clearly with her recommitment to painting using film + fog as a new method. However, pressure between beats is low—the obstacles are nominal, and “the fog seemed to guide her” undercuts any sense of struggle or risk. The Decisive Change is there, but the route feels too unresisted to reach elite-level tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: restoration work → mural stirs with sound → coin awakens → figures emerge and pose a condition → Elara accepts and completes the awakening. Structure is a single, continuous scene with a clear midpoint shift (mural animates) and climax (Elara humming and “conducting” the air). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: her understanding of art and herself changes, with the awakened garden as external proof. The cost is somewhat abstract and low-risk, but the before/after is legible and coherent under a mostly causal with light-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias infiltrates the greenhouse, finds the seed, deciphers its import, then is recruited by Krane into a high-stakes meeting. Orientation (who/where/when) is solidly established early, and the piece maintains a single coherent scene with a brief closing shard. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias chooses to step deeper into danger with the Lexicon, with the crackdown and infiltration providing implied cost. The main limitation is that the crackdown and infiltration remain off-stage, so the sense of immediate sacrifice is more promised than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: entry into the shell, deepening of her work, realization of the blossom armistice, and emergence. Causality (her persistence → the shell’s “response” → understanding) holds, and temporal transitions (“hours turned into days”) are legible. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from restless, inward focus to outward, completed offering and steps out of the shell. The main limitation is that key beats (the long labor, the decisive “shift”) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: wind chime call → deeper into library → museum → Vessel → song → preservation, with a legible before/after where the names are secured and the chime’s purpose is spent. The piece reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the closure (RR) is on the page with some emotional cost. Stakes remain abstract—no real chance of failure, no resistance—so the decisive moment feels more like ritual completion than a pressured choice. Structure is otherwise tight and orientation is strong from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—broken promise → need to mend trust → mythic inkwell → ritual writing → Kael’s appearance and partial reconciliation—is clean and easy to follow. The story achieves closure via a Decisive Change in the relationship, but the magical mechanism works without resistance or complication, making the path feel low-cost and frictionless. Structure (single scene, one dominant drive) suits the length, though escalation between arrival at the archive and the ritual is modest. The emotional price of the earlier loss is mostly summarized rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible: adhesive → hidden code → realization about blueprint → decision to design a compromise mechanism → social resolution. Structure is linear, single-scene with an implied time jump to dawn, and closure is a clear Decisive Change with the plan implemented. However, escalation is largely conceptual; the supposed danger of the volcano and social rift are told rather than dramatized, so the final solution feels somewhat too easy. The “encrypted compassion” reveal and blueprint mechanism emerge more as exposition than as hard-earned turns in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: attic routine → letter (“The songs are in the dust”) → renewed mapping → realization and quiet reconfiguration. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the dust’s meaning changes and her life-story tactics reweight. Causality is gentle but coherent; the letter triggers the new interpretive frame. What holds this below elite level is the relatively low felt cost and absence of a concrete, pressured choice at the climax—she understands, but nothing significant risks breaking on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present on the terrace, one memory shard of the corn maze, and a return to the terrace for closure, all under a consistent causal/accumulative lens. The drive from logbook → terrace → memory → new understanding → renunciation (leaving the logbook) is coherent and lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Stakes and temporal/spatial orientation are always legible. Escalation is quiet but there is a clear tightening when the terrace shifts and the buried memory surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: contemplative exploration → discovery of the fireflies → deepening connection → sudden external threat → departure with reconfigured understanding. Causality is generally sound, but the facility alarms arrive somewhat abruptly, feeling like a mechanical device to force closure rather than an organic escalation from prior beats. The escape pod solution is straightforward and risk is mostly implied rather than scenically contested. Closure does land as a resonant reconfiguration—she leaves with a new stance toward belonging—but the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: problem (missing recollection), attempts (two passes with seed + glass), and a realization that reconfigures her relationship to lost paths. Causality under an accumulative/lyric lens is coherent: each attempt with the seed reframes her understanding of the glass and herself. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, but it’s clearly legible and on the page. The cost of that closure (accepting partial loss) is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is clean: a single performance framed by entry and exit, with a clear climax when the bishop aligns with the skylight and a reflective coda. Causality is simple but coherent—Elias chooses to perform, tracks the crowd, builds to the central image, then departs with his mission reaffirmed. However, the “closure” is more a reaffirmation of a static identity than a decisive change with cost; the before/after line is conceptually tidy but not strongly reconfigured. The drive reads as accumulative/textural and holds, but without a strong tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: illegal act → intensification (dust mixing, first line of verse) → interruption (footsteps) → confrontation and charged reprieve. Causality is legible and coherent under a situational/accumulative lens, and the ending offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira holds her ground and the sentinel turns away. However, the sentinel’s decision to walk away feels a bit under-motivated on the page, softening the sense of concrete cost. The global drive holds, but escalation could tighten with clearer stakes in that final interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and coherent: dawn ritual → pond omen → pull to atrium → vision/epiphany → decision. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with images and reflections building toward a conceptual reconfiguration of his role. Closure does land—he reframes himself as a “keeper of light” and chooses a new outward-facing purpose—but the hinted “shift” remains abstract and its cost diffuse, so the final before/after is more intellectual than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is simple but sound: find box → examine → receive visions → reframe guilt → leave box behind, all within one coherent scene. The accumulative/lyric drive is clear, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he repurposes his pain and physically sets the box down. Causality is mostly emotional rather than event-driven, yet each step follows plausibly from the previous one, and there’s no orientation confusion. The main limitation is low external pressure; nothing in the world pushes back against his process, so the arc feels gentle rather than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene accumulative structure, anchored early in the grotto with Elara, and moves steadily from setup (ritual begins) through deepening (patterns grow complex, tide advances) to a conceptual closure. Causality is modest but intact: her ongoing adjustments to the tide lead to the insight that hope is lived rather than calculated, a valid Conceptual Repricing. The main limitation is that pressure and options never feel sharply constrained; nothing critical turns on success or failure of the ritual beyond a soft internal shift. Still, closure is legible and the before/after stance on hope is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: she explores, finds the diaries, drops the strip, discovers its function as a key, opens the chamber, and gains a reconfigured understanding of her task. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene progression suits the scope. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—her mission shifts from mapping to honoring—with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the price of this shift is more implied than dramatized, which softens the impact of the otherwise solid arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear temporal frame (before the bells) and a causal progression from song to resistance to breakthrough. The closure beat—mirrors reconfiguring into possibilities at the moment the bells toll, with Elara’s weakened heartbeat—is legible and carries cost. There are no orientation issues; stakes and sequence are straightforward to follow. The design is solid rather than intricate, with escalation more implied than intricately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal arc is straightforward and coherent: terrace → descent → negotiation → emotional break → treaty signing → return to terrace, with a clear decisive change (war-ending treaty) and on-page cost (her frayed ideals). Structure is cleanly bookended by the terrace and the “slow dance of celestial bodies,” so orientation and closure both work. The main weakness is that the long negotiation, the supposed crucible, is mostly summarized (“hours turned into days, and still, they talked”) so we never see a concrete turning point before the speech. As a result, the resolution feels slightly too easy for a “forever war” and under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: she caused the drought, follows the riverbed “map,” finds damp soil, buries the egg, and rain begins, giving a clear before/after. The story maintains a single continuous scene with clean orientation and a legible closure built on her decisive act. However, the path is almost frictionless—no real setbacks, doubts, or external resistance—and the rain’s arrival edges toward convenient, slightly magical reward rather than a cost-touched turn. Closure functions as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks sharpness in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara approaches → untangles threads → unlocks sanctuary → releases echoes → city awakens. Structure is linear, single-scene, and easy to follow, with a clear inciting action (approach) and climax (dance that releases the echoes), and closure through the city’s reconfigured state. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after of the city’s lullaby is legible. The main weakness is how effortlessly the process unfolds, with little on-page resistance or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: argument → doubt → reflection in the dome → new decision about how to tell stories → departure to act on it. Structure is straightforward single-scene-with-backstory and lands a clear Decisive Change, but the pivotal conflict (the argument) is entirely summarized, softening the immediacy of the stakes. There’s no serious complication or reversal once the idea arrives; from epiphany onward the movement is frictionless. Closure is present but feels low-risk and somewhat preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece functions as a single, continuous scene with a clean accumulative/lyric structure and a modest Resonant Reconfiguration at the end as Elara finishes the spiral and descends. Causality is simple but intact: absence of monarchs → urgency to honor them → ritual completed and carried into the world. However, the global drive feels more like textured meditation than pressured progression, with no substantial tightening of options or visible cost at closure. The ending image is graceful but low-impact in terms of changed stakes or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: find relic → choose rope method → long work → illumination and melody, with a clear closure beat when the names, including hers, are heard. Structure is straightforward single-POV, single-location, and orientation is solid from the opening. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, and the ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost of success is almost entirely implied and very light. Because there’s no real threat of failure or significant trade-off, the arc feels graceful rather than gripping, which limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → ritual → intensifying symbols → epiphany and release. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the conceptual closure (understanding resonance between path and walker) is legible. However, the path to insight feels relatively untested—no significant setback, doubt, or alternative outcome complicates the arc. The ending alters understanding but not options in a way that would register as a strong cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward—search, discovery of the tile, decoding, realization, acceptance—so orientation and sequence are never in doubt. However, the search and decoding unfold with almost no resistance: the hidden compartment is found quickly, the pattern reveals itself smoothly, and nothing meaningfully threatens his goal. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing (reframing the palace and Kael’s role), but the cost is abstract and low-intensity. The structure feels more like an exposition of an idea than a plot with genuine tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: Elara arrives to help, deploys the music box and cellular memory, Kael resists, then partially yields, producing a clear before/after stance shift. Closure is present (Kael’s decision to begin releasing resentment), but the obstacles to that change are minimal, so the decisive turn feels relatively easy. World rules around the sanctuary and “cellular memory” are sketched just enough to avoid confusion but stay largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causality is clean: wanderer arrives with broken sextant → Elara undertakes the recreation using her inherited method → sextant allows a glimpse of boundary dissolution. The structure is single-arc and coherent, with one main escalation (the repair scene) leading into an externally focused climax in the orchard. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she experiences the dream as threshold reality and recognizes boundaries as penetrable fog, with a new ongoing task implied. Cost is present but mild (the moment is fleeting; work “just beginning”), so the ending is satisfying but not deeply wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset: we know who Elara is, where she is, and what she wants. The causal chain (breach of vow → search in cathedral → use of bag items → discovery and transformation of the vow) is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she conceptually reframes failure as necessary shedding, symbolized by weaving the ribbon into the glowing tree. The main weakness is that obstacles are minimal, so the transformation feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the cameo, bathroom realization, encounter with the keeper, and a closing reorientation of purpose. Causality functions but remains soft—the key answers arrive via a conveniently timed exposition figure rather than through Elara’s costly choices. Closure does land as a conceptual repricing: she redefines her role from cataloger to heir, with the orchard reweighted as destiny. The cost of this shift, however, is only abstractly implied and never concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s warning → diary → chrono-blossom → garden → guardian → bargain → exit, with a legible before/after in finding the library and securing knowledge. However, many crucial beats (“traps,” research, negotiation) are summarized rather than dramatized, dulling the sense of mounting difficulty. Closure is present but the cost is abstract and lightly sketched, so the decisive change lands more conceptually than viscerally. Structure fits the length, but feels closer to an outline of a strong story than a fully lived scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival on the ship → guided exploration via the glowing card → narrative-threads room → mist-door and crossing, with a clear before/after. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative/causal lens, and the closure—stepping through the door as the card dissolves—lands on the page as a decisive change. The cost (letting go of the card and prior self-conception) is implied more than dramatized, but it’s present. Transitions are smooth, and there are no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: seal → rope correspondences → rebraiding → door opening → artifact chamber. The story delivers an on-page closure unit (a resonant reconfiguration: the tower’s role and the seal’s meaning are reweighted), but the cost of success is largely conceptual, not dramatized. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a coherent throughline and no orientation issues. The drive lens reads mainly causal with mild accumulative texture and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: caves in crisis → Lira follows the cracks/path → reaches the bloom → uses song to activate it → storm abates. Structure is clean single-scene quest with on-page closure (the world’s chaos is stilled), under a mainly causal lens with some accumulative atmosphere. The main weakness is how frictionless the path is—no real setbacks, no antagonistic beat from the energy beings, and the bloom activates on the first try. Cost at closure is minimal and the resolution feels somewhat pre-ordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: relic → star-path method → failed attempt → discovery of ritual → memory sacrifice → prism’s restoration, with a clear before/after and on-page cost. The piece adheres to a single POV and one main throughline without tangents, and the closure unit (the prism’s reformation and Elara’s altered memory-state) is legible. Some beats—like weeks of work—are compressed into summary, which slightly blunts pressure, but they don’t break structure. Overall it’s a well-shaped, classically causal arc appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: task → anomaly in shadows → contact with fog wall → visions → renewed commitment. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with the visions deepening rather than sharply turning the action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reaffirms her role—but the stakes never truly pinch, and there’s no meaningful narrowing of options or visible price at the end. Orientation is strong from the outset, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is linear and coherent: arrival → preparation at the fountain → lighting/fire display → mosaic → crowd response/closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via ritual and gathering spectators rather than through plot reversals, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration as the fortress shifts from despair to hope. Causality is intact but gentle; nothing significant threatens failure, so the global drive feels low-risk. Closure exists and is legible, but the cost attached to it is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: grotto → cicada activation → visions → revised stance, with a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end. Causality is simple but intact (her focus on the cicada triggers the time-texture experience), and the orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the first paragraph. Closure exists—she exits resolved to reframe her chronicles—but the cost of that shift is barely sketched; nothing meaningful is foreclosed beyond a vague tension with Kael. The piece leans heavily on summary of insight rather than dramatized turns, which flattens structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: bunker life → preparation → inversion → climb → experience → return with reconfigured stance, under a clear causal drive lens. The gravity inversion and her secret training pay off logically, and the final realization about silence provides a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard plot twist. However, the cost of her choice is underplayed—there is no strong on-page moment where returning to the bunker or leaving the father’s world carries felt consequence beyond a brief acknowledgment. Closure is solid and legible, but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ride with one clear turn (the move to the quieter sector/garden), leading to a calm but legible closure as Mira disembarks changed. Causality holds and the storm glass provides a concrete throughline, but the arc is very linear and risk-free. Closure is more a soft resonance than a decisive change with palpable cost, though it does satisfy at this lyrical scale. No orientation issues or lens confusion, but the ending could tighten the sense of “before/after” more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: murals → waterfall door → archway mechanism → stair ascent → throne realization, with no major logical gaps. The piece achieves a coherent closure via conceptual repricing of the throne’s meaning, but the on-page cost of that realization is light. The time limit “until sunrise” never concretely alters tactics, which blunts structural tension. Overall, the structure is sound but closer to a polished vignette than a fully pressurized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: thinning threshold → encroaching darkness → recourse to the inherited ring → sealing at the cost of a severed scar. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the piece delivers an on-page Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: the sanctuary is saved, the threshold stabilized, and a bond is lost. Structure is straightforward and largely linear, with one central arc that lands without confusion. What keeps it below the highest tier is the predictability of the turn—no surprising complication or structural risk beyond the expected sacrificial climax.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward: bolt → message → ritual → portal → machine → revelation → return, with no major orientation or logic breaks. However, pressure doesn’t really tighten; obstacles in the conceptual world are minimal and each instruction works on the first try, making the middle feel like a tour rather than an escalating sequence. Closure exists—a conceptual repricing where Elara returns with new power and purpose—but the cost of that change is almost entirely implied, not dramatized. The future-self texting twist is neat but arrives and resolves quickly, without significantly reconfiguring options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: reading room → activation of gramophone → visionary bridge scene → revelation → return, with a legible before/after via Eleanor’s new understanding. Causality is straightforward (she cranks the gramophone, which leads to the vision and journal), but major answers are delivered by an exposition figure and written confession, minimizing dramatized struggle. Closure is present as a conceptual reconfiguration—her role redefined from “revive the dynasty” to “honor and release it”—but the cost is stated more than felt. The drive lens reads as causal with a mystical device, and it holds, though with low resistance along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece holds a clear single-scene structure with tight focus: Alaric in the greenhouse, triggered by the program and vines, leading to an internal reconfiguration. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than strictly logical, yet each step (vines shifting, program vibrating, ink seeping, final realization) follows coherently from the last. Closure is present—he emerges with a new stance and the altered greenhouse mirrors it—but the ending doesn’t foreground a concrete, on-page cost or foreclosed path. As a result, the before/after boundary is emotionally real yet somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—finds button → follows dust patterns → identifies L. Hayes → connects to Clara’s unsent letter → decides to “unfurl this history”—is clean and easy to follow. The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, deepening meaning rather than staging big reversals, and closure lands in her committed decision to shape this narrative. The cost of this decision is lightly implied (reopening her own wounds) rather than made sharply legible. Structure is straightforward and functional but not architecturally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—from research to lagoon to archive to citywide broadcast under threat—is clean and easy to follow, and the ending delivers a coherent Charged Poise/Decisive Change: the truth is released and Mara becomes a hunted ghost. The single-scene structure is appropriate for the length, and there’s a legible before/after in her options once the data is out. That said, key turns (the archive’s broadcast ability, the enforcers arriving just after the transmission) feel somewhat convenient and under-strained, with cost more implied than dramatized. Still, closure is solidly on the page and the drive lens (causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecy → decision to play → grotto’s response → prophecy dissolves, giving solid on-page closure. Structure is linear and coherent, with one scene that escalates via environmental reaction. However, the prophecy never actively resists; the resolution feels somewhat frictionless, with little sense that failure was genuinely possible. Cost at closure is mostly implied exertion and strain, not a sharply defined before/after sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: sorting → discovery → ritual → revelation → research → renewed vocation, with no orientation problems. The structure is essentially linear with one soft transition from the discovery night into a summarizing “days turned into weeks” research montage. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration—she now understands herself as more than a seed sorter—but the cost of this shift is not concretely dramatized. The piece reads more like an origin vignette than a full, pressurized story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: stranger → box → compass → greenhouse → hidden door → cavern → map → realization, with no major logic breaks. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of time and uncertainty—is clearly on the page. However, the cost of his change is muted; nothing he gives up feels truly difficult beyond a stated mindset shift. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a reflective coda, and that holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is linear and coherent: foundry → contemplation → furnace entry → visions → reframed understanding and exit. Causality is sound under an accumulative/lyric lens: the coin and the foundry’s atmosphere lead plausibly to her visions and conceptual shift. Closure lands via a clear before/after in how she understands “redemption” and names, with the coin fixed to her sign and claimed as hers. The cost is present but subtle, mostly in the quiet renunciation of prior self-conceptions rather than a sharply dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → descent → encounter → confession via harp → release → talisman and renewed purpose. Closure is solidly on the page with a decisive change (the soul released, tooth spent) and a resonant reconfiguration for Elara (aligned harp, new talisman). The cost—his grief finally felt and relinquished, her emotional burden acknowledged—is legible but could be sharper or riskier. Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation issues or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a simple accumulative walk through the forest culminating in the dropping of the strap and a conceptual shift about mercy. Closure is present and legible: she moves from tethered-to-past to released, with the strap’s loss marking a before/after. However, there’s little true turning or tightening; beats feel like a steady, even drift of reflection rather than events that materially alter her options or stance. The causal flow is clear, but the arc is low-intensity for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: lens → symbol in painting → hidden map → ruined tower → murals decoded → reclaimed narrative, with clear spatial and temporal orientation. The structure is linear and tidy but somewhat frictionless, with no meaningful setback, reversal, or difficult decision. Closure exists—a completed quest and an internal sense of fulfillment—but the cost is abstract and largely asserted (“gratitude,” “resilience of intuition”) rather than dramatized. Under a causal lens, the piece reads more like a graceful vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: ghosts draw Marcus → he finds the barrel → analyzes disturbance → discovers the clock → restores it, which releases the ghosts and heals the building. The piece operates under a primarily causal lens with a touch of situational pressure, and closure is solid: the environment and Marcus’s inner stance both change in a legible before/after. The main structural limitation is the relatively frictionless path to resolution—no real setbacks or competing options complicate his course. Still, for this length, the single-scene arc is coherent, self-contained, and satisfies the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: rupture → bottle → descent into clouds → revelation of living library → return as caretaker. The structure is linear, with one central excursion; orientation is solid throughout and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the library’s nature and her role are redefined. However, the beats between discovery and return are relatively frictionless, with little complication or narrowing of options, so the arc feels more like an initiated tour than a pressured progression. The cost of the final change remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dismissed theory → plan involving shard and storms → infiltration of the Hall → visions → evidence that forces concession, with a clear before/after. Structure is mostly expository until the storm sequence, which compresses the heist and ritual into a few efficient but low-friction lines. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus reconfiguration—her theory is proven at real personal cost—but opposition is mostly off-stage, and the Hall breach feels conveniently unresisted. The piece reads as coherent and complete, but not yet maximally tightened or dramatized for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious box → discovery of tether and map → journey → freeing the box → restoration of balance, with no major logic gaps. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (light restored, covenant renewed, chip spent) and a legible before/after frame. However, many key beats are summarized (“The journey… took him… Along the way, he met a tinker…”) rather than dramatized, which flattens some potential turns. The cost is relatively soft and mostly conceptual, keeping this short of elite-level structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and linear: factory → basement → tunnel → lagoon, with each step causally linked through the compass and psychometry. Closure is present in her conceptual shift and earned stasis—she accepts mystery rather than grasping for answers or the compass. The cost of that stance (relinquishing the last tangible tie to her grandfather) is intelligible but underplayed, so the before/after boundary is more intellectual than visceral. As an accumulative/textural piece the escalation is sufficient, but a sharper on-page price at the end would raise the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the archway → entering → discovering the chamber → merging slides → revelation of the map and new role. The closure unit—a decisive change in her self-conception and mission—is on the page and coherent, but the structural stakes remain low and largely intellectual. The storm and GPS failure set up situational pressure that never truly constrains options, so the climax feels safe and slightly preordained. Overall structure works but lacks a sharper cost or turn.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: dream/postcards → decision to travel → encounter with windows → return to paint → realization, with causal links intact. The accumulative/lyric drive is coherent and closure is achieved via a conceptual repricing (“why flowers bloom at night”) that reweights prior images. However, turns are gentle; the journey and cathedral visit unfold without real complication, so the before/after remains more contemplative than pressurized. Closure lands but the sense of irreversible cost or narrowed options is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: diary/letters → belief in lagoon → ritual attempts → entity’s appearance → parley and implied opening of a path. Structure is straightforward (past weeks summarized, then a single present-tense scene) and easy to follow, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the world of silence becomes one where dialogue with the past is possible, but the cost and consequences are mostly deferred. The overall arc feels more like a prologue to a larger story than a fully tested unit.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the bottle → mental focusing/conceiving → town’s revival → departure. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with a decisive change at closure. However, problems resolve as soon as they are posed, without complication or genuine narrowing of options, so the arc feels somewhat frictionless. The “timeframe” and “last wish” elements arrive late and read as an imposed rule rather than an organic structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: shaving → phonograph → prophecy → garden symbols → realization → verbal acknowledgment. Structure is linear and lucid, with one main turn at the moment the recording plays and another soft deepening when she deciphers the bark. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, but the before/after distinction is intellectual rather than pressured—her options were never sharply limited. Nothing important is left dangling, yet the arc feels more like a gentle unveiling than a truly decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: acorn cap → archway activation → vortex opens → crossing into the new landscape → acceptance of the inheritance. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with one clear escalation point at the reopening of the vortex and a legible before/after at the end. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing, but the lack of real resistance or complication keeps the arc from feeling fully tested. No orientation issues; the drive lens reads as primarily causal with mild lyric overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece has a clean single-scene structure: anomaly → rope twitch → hum → deliberate pull → bell and rain, with a legible before/after in his understanding of the sanctuary. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure moment (bell toll, rain, redefined role) is on the page. However, the “zero hour” arrives without much resistance or sacrifice, so the threshold feels more wondrous than costly. All setups are kept, but nothing meaningfully complicates or endangers his path.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the lantern, mysterious activation of the trackers, following the coordinates to a revelation, and a quiet closure when the lantern’s glow passes into her. Causality within this accumulative, contemplative frame holds together, and the before/after is solidly legible. The closure unit—Lira internalizing the lantern’s “strength” as it dims—is on the page and coherent, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatically tested. The piece would reach a higher band with a slightly sharper on-page consequence or a more pressured decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the box → revelation of the covenant → investigation → ritual and restoration, with a legible before/after. Closure lands on the page via both a decisive change (oasis revives) and a reconfiguration of Elias’s role (recluse → guardian), even if the cost is largely conceptual. The structure is straightforward and well-contained for the length, but most turns arrive without complication or reversal, giving the piece a slightly outlined feel. The lack of any on-page price for success keeps the ending from reaching a more powerful cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clear: chronometer malfunction → capsule/fragment discovery → garage-sale outreach → Thaddeus reveal → descent and device activation → time restored. Structure is linear and easy to follow with one clean escalation into the hidden chamber. However, most beats resolve quickly and smoothly, with little resistance or complication, so the closure, while present, feels somewhat frictionless. The cost of success is conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: lagoon contemplation → kite’s fall → encounter → shared repair → emotional reconfiguration. Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation issues and a legible closure where the wanderer’s stance toward imperfection shifts. However, the path from meeting to restoration is frictionless—no real setback or complication as they fix the kite or connect—which flattens the arc. The closure reads more like a graceful culmination of mood than a hard-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent: diagnosis → decision to remodel → unfolding discoveries → completed transformation → death. Causality holds, and the closure (Elias finishing his work and dying with the orchard transformed) lands as an Earned Stasis/RR with a clear before/after. Escalation is mild—discoveries arrive smoothly, with little resistance or complication—so the middle doesn’t meaningfully tighten options. Still, the piece maintains orientation and delivers a clean, if gently paced, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure—a linear ascent, midpoint meeting, climax in the chamber, and reflective descent—is clean and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Each step upward adds symbolic and atmospheric weight, and the amber at the summit functions as a clear closure device via Conceptual Repricing. Causality is simple but intact: discovery → ascent → encounter → revelation → re-interpretation of homecoming. The main limitation is that the decisive change is more conceptual than pressured, with relatively gentle stakes and little sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: arrive at jetty → plant seeds with birds’ guidance → depart with renewed purpose. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of planting, listening, and invoking the dead builds toward a quiet closure where hope feels slightly earned. However, there’s minimal genuine turning—no significant complication or disruption to his plan—and the “cost” is conceptual rather than dramatized. Closure functions as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but the before/after distinction is more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Lira brings the leaf → Elias investigates the factory → the phonograph reading triggers his realization → he returns with an answer. Structure (home → factory → return) is orderly and easy to follow, and the closure is a conceptual repricing of the wasteland. However, the decisive change lacks a strong sense of cost or constrained options—he understands something new, but little feels genuinely foreclosed or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is straightforward: one continuous scene on the deck interleaved with reflection on the shutdown, leading to a quiet conceptual shift at the end. Causality is coherent but light; her decision to come, sketch, reflect, then reframe her role forms a clean accumulative arc without strong turns. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing (she reinterprets her pariah status as a calling), but the cost of this stance is mostly implied and not dramatized in-scene. Orientation is clear from early on (who/where/when; no penalties there).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: legend → ascent → labyrinth → chess trial → artifact use → restored sky, with no orientation or logic breaks. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (sky restored) paired with Kael’s inner reconfiguration, both clearly on the page. However, several key beats are summarized (the trials, “hours turned to moments” of the game), and obstacles never seriously threaten failure, softening the impact of the resolution. The ending is neat and legible but lacks a strong sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is clean: anchored in the gallery, Elara → chessboard → Kael → walking ritual → realization, with a clear before/after RR closure. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the ending’s conceptual shift is legible. However, the path from setup to liberation feels somewhat linear and untested, with few complications or turns once Kael arrives. The closure has cost mostly in implication rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: she wanders the labyrinth, finds the stone, uses it, the bookstore and stone respond, and she reaches a new understanding; the throughline is easy to follow. Structure is linear, single-scene, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing (home reconceived as internal state). What’s missing for a higher score is a more demanding turn: nothing meaningfully obstructs or complicates her use of the stone, and the “storm” never constrains options. The cost of change is asserted in the abstract (“pain of remembering”) rather than dramatized at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: village → tapestry decoding → revelation about the king → labyrinth opening → message about forgiveness → internal shift. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a single throughline of entering the labyrinth to seek absolution. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration (her stance toward her guilt changes), but the path through the labyrinth is frictionless—no real complication or decision point once she starts decoding, which softens the sense of cost. The “message on the thread” solution also feels slightly mechanical compared to the atmospheric build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in place and desire, building toward the spire’s activation and the final internal shift. Causality is accumulative but coherent—her approach, touch, poetry, and questions all bring the spire to life and peel back her psyche. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines forgiveness for herself and emerges with a new stance and a literal/figurative path forward. There are no orientation problems or rule cheats; the elders’ “ritual” frame is underused but doesn’t damage structure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story has a clean, causal throughline: investigation → alignment of charm/statue → magical activation and structural crisis → verbal act that stabilizes the workshop and reconfigures her self-understanding. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where she moves from desperate meaning-seeking to a steadier, hopeful stance, and the piece tracks that before/after legibly. However, cost is soft: the near-collapse of the workshop resolves quickly once she speaks, with no lasting loss or complication. Under an accumulative/textural lens the structure is solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: sanctuary habit → blocked path → deeper cave → oasis → painting → public display, with a clear before/after in her stance toward the world. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with some textural accumulation, and closure lands in her decision to rejoin the world via the painting. Cost at the end is implied (exposure, vulnerability) but only lightly dramatized, and no serious challenge threatens her goal once the oasis is found. Structure is solid but somewhat safe and low-tension for a prestige venue.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: lighthouse routine → intensified pull of the cork → vision of the figure → beach/grove encounter → return with new understanding. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, with the cork and scent linking beats rather than plot mechanics doing the work. Closure is present in Elias’s repriced understanding of “vibrations of intent” and his reframed relationship to his role. However, the key turn (the woman imparting the line) arrives with little resistance or complication, so the change feels low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain—calls → building the device → activation at full moon → travelers arriving → station as refuge—is clean and easy to follow, with a legible before/after reconfiguration. Closure is present but the cost is relatively soft: the cyclical dimming is more a conceptual weight than a dramatized sacrifice or concrete loss. Several big moves (what exactly the device does, why it succeeds so cleanly) are summarized rather than pressured in-scene, keeping escalation modest. Overall structure is sound but does not fully exploit the potential for sharper turns or harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: foraging → discovery of the eye → onset of curse → consultation with Mara → dawn ritual → restored equilibrium. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single time/space transition to the village is legible and motivated. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—relinquishing the eye and lifting the curse—combined with a conceptual reweighting of truth vs. safety, though the solution unfolds somewhat straightforwardly once the ritual is introduced. The cost is present (giving up the relic and accepting his limits) but not deeply pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: a continuous scene that moves from uneasy calm to discovery (boot print, then journal) to a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is modest but coherent—his investigation leads to the footprint, which leads to the journal, which reframes the stranger’s gesture. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with Elias adopting the role of keeper of borrowed memories. The cost of this shift remains somewhat abstract and unpressured, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: chip → ants → secret passage → cavern → figure → mission → evolving map. However, the structure is essentially a straight-line discovery sequence with little resistance, detour, or complication. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—Elias reconceives “doorway of decisions” and his role—but the cost of this shift is faint. The explanation-heavy middle (the figure’s exposition) flattens what could be a sharper structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: warning → compulsion → climb → revelation → vow, with no serious orientation issues. Closure is present in her vow to restore balance and the grotto’s “sigh of relief,” but the cost of this new responsibility remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized. The advisors’ “final warning” never returns as concrete pressure, and the figure in starlight functions as an expositional shortcut. Structure is solidly functional, but not yet at a level where the final turn feels deeply earned or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with clear anchors (who/where/when) and an identifiable closure: the ritual succeeds and their shared moment is reweighted. Causality is simple but intact—talk of the method leads to the humming/chant, which triggers the shell’s glow and the revalued world. However, the “rules” of the magic/time manipulation remain abstract and largely thematic, so the cost and constraints of the act feel soft. Closure functions as a mild Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a hard turn with real price.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: present in the cabin → reflective setup (grave) → dream-vision confrontation → return with reconfigured stance, all under a coherent accumulative/causal lens. Causality holds—grave leads to disarray, scroll catalyzes the inner journey, the vision reconfigures her relationship to her past selves. Closure is on-page via the scroll’s single sentence and her choice to write, with a legible before/after, though the cost of the change is more implied than sharply felt. The simplicity of the arc and absence of complicating turns keep this in strong but not exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with backstory woven in and a clear arc from curiosity about the screw to a reframed understanding of its meaning and her loss. Drive feels accumulative/textural, and closure lands via conceptual repricing—her anosmia and the screw’s significance are reweighted in the final paragraph. Causality is modest but coherent (Mira’s return → disclosure → Elara’s tactile encounter → articulated insight), with no orientation issues. The main ceiling comes from relatively low concrete cost or consequence; the change is meaningful but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward: storm threat → stress reaction (quill crystallizes) → deliberate grounding via superstition → restored calm and completed ceremony. Structure is clean single-scene with one clear escalation point (first raindrop/quill change) and a closure where her stance toward fear and scars is different. However, the external storm abates somewhat conveniently in sync with her inner resolution, softening the sense of real cost or constrained options. Closure is present and coherent but not especially complex.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: archive → bottle engagement → induced currents → vision of grandmother → emotional resolution, all under the orchard’s looming loss. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara shifts from regret to a charged acceptance in which the orchard still falls but meaning changes. Causality is intact and legible, with the ritual clearly causing the vision and the felt forgiveness. Stakes remain intimate and the external orchard thread never tests her with an on-page choice, which keeps the frame slightly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: temple → mural → shimmering room → merger, culminating in a clear closure beat when the dictionary fuses with the mural and redefines the witness’s role. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, with each space offering a deeper engagement with the same drive. However, the cost of success is almost entirely conceptual, with no real jeopardy or difficult choice; all obstacles yield on contact. The piece closes cleanly but without the felt price an elite market would want.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: Elias stays late → fixates on key → discovers notch → unlocks compartment → reads scroll → reframes time and himself. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the piece holds a mostly causal/accumulative lens to a clear conceptual-repricing closure. The main weakness is the softness of cost—the revelation arrives without much resistance or failed attempt, so the arc reads almost schematic. Still, for this length, the before/after is legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal spine—patrol → disturbance → footprints → encounter → realization—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clear before/after in Elara’s perspective. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: her role shifts from pure protection to seeing boundaries as connective. However, the supposed “intrusion detection” frame never faces a serious test, and the encounter resolves smoothly without any structural surprise or tight constraint. The ending’s cost is mostly implied, not concretely dramatized, which keeps the closure from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single night in the library framed around her reading the scrawls and ending in a written resolution. Causality is light but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with present stimuli (lantern, scrawls, rain) cueing reflection. Closure is a conceptual repricing—she redefines “lucid contradictions” and commits to a path—though the cost of that shift is only gently implied. Stakes and turns remain modest, so the ending feels more like a quiet reframing than a truly pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: an anchored opening, escalating strange calls, discovery and use of the disc, then a quiet but decisive ending. The causal chain from humming callers → Eli’s experiment with the disc → realization of its bridging function → his own outgoing call is coherent and satisfying. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with emotional cost: he relinquishes his safe distance to re-enter a past relationship. The main weakness is that the metaphysical leap about the disc’s nature is somewhat explained rather than earned through more granular beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and coherent: locket → investigation → Mara’s revelation → Elara’s recommitment forms a clean accumulative arc. Causality is intact but gentle, with no major reversal or complication beyond learning the covenant’s nature. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara consciously joins the covenant through her archival work. The cost and stakes remain largely conceptual, which keeps the piece from feeling truly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → station → clock → transformed vision → internal reorientation, with one clear hinge when she touches the clock. Structure (abandoned station shifting briefly into another timeline) is easy to follow and returns neatly to the present frame. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: her understanding of loneliness and connection changes, and the story’s before/after is legible. The main limitation is that the transformation feels relatively unearned—no on-page test or resistance challenges her belief, so the change reads a bit frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: disturbance in the forest → following the musical trail with the ring → encounter with the stillpoint → internal repricing of her quest. Structure is straightforward and cohesive, with one continuous journey and a clear closure beat when the compass stills and her understanding shifts. The cost of the journey is more implied than dramatized—no serious alternative paths or risks are put on the page—so the ending reads more as graceful completion than hard closure. Still, the piece satisfies a lyric, accumulative drive lens without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causality is clear: wrong seeds → anomaly → Elara investigates → enters → uses the pen to “unbend” the timeline, and the anomaly stabilizes, with a legible before/after. The single-scene structure with a brief backstory interleave is coherent, and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with slight lyric accumulation. Closure is present but the cost is mild—she succeeds on the first attempt with no visible sacrifice or serious risk beyond a generalized uncertainty. The farmer and historian threads are neatly folded in as visions, but they function more as explanatory montage than as on-page obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece reads as a single continuous scene with a clean accumulative structure: gestures → camera’s impossible click → renewed, more active shaping of silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where silence and stillness are revalued and Elara “finds her voice” conceptually. Causality is soft but coherent for a lyric mode; the magical camera turn is earned enough by prior hints of hum/glow. The main weakness is that the before/after line is more thematic than situational—her options in the world haven’t visibly shifted, only her framing of them.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean and linear: tapestry → portrait → mural → sketches → hidden door → scroll, with no major orientation issues and a clear single POV. Closure lands in a straightforward way when the protagonist deciphers the scroll and gains understanding of the promise and the civilization’s legacy. However, almost every obstacle yields without friction, so turns read as procedural discovery rather than pressured choice. The cost at the end is primarily conceptual and lightly sketched, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal spine—go to lagoon → drumming syncs with water → realization about entangled memories → new mission—is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in stance and purpose, with the lagoon event reconfiguring her understanding of the treatment. However, the lagoon’s response feels slightly convenient; there’s no real structural doubt that it will be benevolent and revelatory once it starts glowing and humming. The scene holds together as one clean arc, but the lack of genuine jeopardy or complication keeps it from higher-band structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: Eli finds the coin, map, and key, follows the map, meets Mira, faces the container wall, uses the key, and reaches the luminous passage. The structure fits a short quest with one main tightening at the blocked wall and Mira’s challenge, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the labyrinth as a test of will/whispers. The major weakness is cost: the journey feels oddly frictionless, with no significant sacrifice, injury, or irreversible loss, so the before/after divide is intellectually clear but not deeply felt. Some elements (the coin, the “test” idea) are set up but don’t meaningfully complicate or reshape the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is clean: one scene on the dock, stranger arrives with a secret, confesses, leaves lighter; closure lands as a modest resonant reconfiguration. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the weaving shutters and mirror reflection build toward the final constellation image coherently. However, causality is very soft—nothing meaningfully constrains options or forces a difficult choice. The ending’s before/after is legible but low-cost and somewhat pre-ordained by the guardian’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is straightforward: ability → plan → preparation → execution → contemplative payoff. Causality is intact but frictionless—no obstacle complicates the organization of the displays or the night itself. Closure exists as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias sees the town pause, but the before/after is mostly conceptual and low-cost. The piece leans accumulative/lyric rather than truly driven by events.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent under a largely causal lens: scrimshaw → dream/call → voyage → island/heart → letting go → return changed. Structure is cleanly single-arc with a decisive on-page change (releasing the scrimshaw, dissolving the barrier) and an emotionally legible before/after. However, key obstacles (the island’s rise, the barrier’s dissolution) appear and resolve with minimal friction, so while closure is sound, the sense of difficulty and constraint is relatively light for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV accumulative scene framed by present action (whittling in the farmhouse) with integrated backstory. Causality is simple but coherent: mandate → loss of brother/career → retreat → ritual of whittling and private narration → quiet inner rebellion crystallized in the final heart. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment, with Elara choosing endurance and private defiance at a visible emotional cost. The piece lacks a strong mid-scene turn, so progression feels more like deepening texture than a true escalation of options.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: arrival → entry → invocation → transformation → understanding → departure, with each beat deepening the central ritual. Causality within the magical logic is legible (touching the quartz prompts the shift; speaking deepens it), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the poet and world are mutually altered. However, some middle beats reiterate the same transformation idea with slight verbal variation, so escalation feels more like steady intensification than a distinct tightening with new stakes. The cost of the change is conceptually implied but not strongly dramatized in structural terms.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: courtyard → backstory of phoenix and barters → present with vibrating concertina → nocturnal climax and realization. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, with motifs (glass, plants, music, awakening) layering until the final reconfiguration of how Elias understands beauty. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act, and the cost—living permanently with limitation but revaluing it—is present but subtle. No major causality breaks, though the “spirits” responding to his plant-music plea functions more as a lyrical convenience than a rigorously motivated turn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: Elara discovers the lens, uses the device, experiences layered sounds, and reaches a renewed sense of purpose. The accumulative/textural drive (each sound adding meaning) is coherent, and closure arrives via a conceptual shift toward balance and connection. Still, the causal chain is low-pressure; no beat meaningfully constrains her options or forces a difficult choice. The closure lands, but feels more like a completed meditation than a story that had something to lose.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear: established routine → anomaly in the curtains → illumination and activation of the stencil → Elara’s choice → renewed purpose. Closure is on the page with a decisive change in stance and a legible before/after in her relationship to grief and work. The cost—risking a new identity marked on her body and committing to purpose—is more implied than sharply dramatized, so the turn lands softly rather than as a high-stakes pivot. Structure is straightforward and coherent, if not particularly surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: crypto crash → Mira’s anomalies → her decision to confide → joint investigation → conceptual realization, all contained within a single, well-oriented scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the Tower shifts from omen to blueprint, and Elara reframes the past as something that can be “reversed.” However, the decisive change is primarily intellectual; the story stops at recognition and intention without a concrete shift in their external options or explicit cost. Still, the structure is coherent, and the drive lens (causal with conceptual payoff) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from examination to discovery (erased pattern) to activation of the pagoda and a conceptual revaluation of the past. Causality is coherent—her interpretive leap about absence and the spoken word trigger the transformation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: knowledge redefined from external secret to internal mirror, with a before/after in her stance. The cost is present but somewhat soft-focused, more asserted than dramatized in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: research into the shadow, discovery of the unusual vial, manifestation of the shadow, and transformative act form a coherent causal chain. The single-scene frame with a bit of reflective setup is well contained and the closure—shadow transformed and stone set aside—lands as a decisive change with a new stasis. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, but the shift from threat/glitch to understood remnant of lost dreams is legible and earned. Nothing vital feels unforeshadowed or retrofitted late.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene of reflection anchored in the workshop, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the tail tip becomes a symbol of resilience. Causality is minimal but coherent—betrayal → reflection → reframing—without contradictions or orientation issues. However, the structural arc is very gentle; the rebuilding process is mostly told rather than staged through distinct, escalating beats. Closure is present and legible, but the path there feels somewhat pre-declared rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is legible and clean: hourglass + plant whispers → tunnel → cavern → reunited hourglasses → emotional closure. Structure is straightforward, with a single continuous quest-like arc and a visible before/after in her relationship to her wounds and memories. The main weakness is how conveniently the obstacles resolve—there’s a door, a tunnel, a pedestal; nothing resists her, and the miracle reunites without complication or price. Closure is present and coherent, but the ease of the path undercuts its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: single scene, clear orientation, a coherent accumulative drive from entering the booth to leaving with the strip. Causality is straightforward—she projects, reads, discovers the repository, then chooses to take the film—and the pattern of still frames into merging letters is legible. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she exits with a new sense of purpose and responsibility. The cost of that decision is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the ending from fully sharpening into a charged before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric rather than strongly causal, with a clean single scene plus one memory shard. The closure is a Charged Poise: Lira at rest beneath the archway, ready to begin, which offers a before/after but very little felt cost. The drive (to free stardust/creativity) is declared yet never materially tested or narrowed on the page. Structure is coherent and legible, but the ending lands more as a prologue than a resolved short story unit.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: dune → charm → descent → archive → clock revives sparks → reconfigured archive. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the outset, and the single transition underground is smooth. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive revives and its behavior shifts, and Mara claims an ongoing role. However, the lack of obstacles or real uncertainty keeps the structure from feeling tense or necessary at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal spine is clean: sixth sense → exploratory wandering → gear/machine activation → epiphany, and closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration. The structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, but much of the middle is accumulative description rather than pressure that tightens options. The final activation of the machine works as a clear climactic beat, yet the cost of this transformation is underdeveloped, so the before/after change is more intellectual than felt. Overall, it’s solid but not yet at a level where the arc feels indispensable or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: dock → crossing → ascent → cliff encounter → return, with each step causally linked and easy to follow. The closure is a solid resonant reconfiguration: Mara internalizes the “stamp,” ending her vigil and leaving free, with a legible before/after. The ferryman’s younger reappearance is unexplained but reads as intentional mysticism rather than a causality glitch. Stakes are modestly scaled but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: ritualized stasis → anomalous stain → hidden chamber revelation → reconfigured return → altered role, with clear causal links. The hidden bolt and ensuing vision function as the central turn, and closure lands with a decisive change in Elias’s understanding and chosen stance. Cost is primarily conceptual (bearing knowledge, relinquishing illusory safety), which works but could be dramatized with more friction or risk in the present. Orientation is excellent, and the hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds comfortably to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: secret messages → counter-annotations → escalation into more dangerous texts → confrontation. Closure lands decisively when the pretender fails to “write [their] truth” and is unmasked, and the story maintains a coherent drive toward that moment. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless—years of subterfuge end in a single symbolic gesture with little resistance or fallout. The “across the pause of shifting constellations” frame decorates rather than structurally tightening time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: mysterious page appears → she tries to ignore it → it keeps tugging at her → she finally interrogates it and reinterprets its meaning. The causal chain is modest but intact, and the final realization about the coastline and symbol functions as a conceptual repricing of the past. The drive lens is essentially accumulative/textural and holds consistently. The closure is quiet and idea-centered, with an implied cost in the recognition of historical failure rather than a concrete present-tense consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: Lira enters, engages with the circle, experiences the vision, and exits with a decision, all in one coherent scene. Closure functions as a decisive change (renewed commitment) and a resonant reconfiguration of what the rebellion means, but the cost of this shift is mostly implied rather than dramatized. The drive lens reads as largely causal with a light accumulative texture, and it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → decoding script → aligning with embryo → unsealing and vision → new resolve. The story maintains a single, coherent scene with no orientation issues and lands a clear decisive change when the embryo cracks and Mara commits to action. However, the path is relatively frictionless—the guard interruption is quickly defused, and nothing meaningfully threatens failure—so the closure has limited sense of price. Structurally it’s sound and publishable but not yet gripping at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: arboretum → wind snatches photograph → near fall → recovered photo → renewed artistic engagement → return to cliff with changed stance. Closure lands as an internal reconfiguration where she reframes her trauma and relation to stillness and hope, with the photo and cliff as anchors. Structure is linear and clean for this length, though the midsection reflection on the lighthouse keeper and her artistry slightly diffuses immediate pressure rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: she moves from shattered box to reordering cards to ascending the stairs, with each step causally linked. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration—she reinterprets darkness/light and reclaims her art. That said, the middle section meanders slightly; the act of sorting the cards never quite faces a concrete obstacle or interruption. The result is satisfying but somewhat soft in terms of on-page cost and tightened options.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: grief → search with drone → tent encounter → vial contact → vision → reframed understanding, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the ink (control vs understanding) with emotional cost in reliving her brother’s final moments. However, the path to the source of the ink feels convenient and unresisted, and external obstacles are minimal. The single-scene structure works but leaves the climax feeling slightly under-tested for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → decision → descent → activation → theft → exit, with no orientation issues. The piece lands a clear closure unit as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she has irrevocably copied the data and must now live with that choice. Some key beats, especially the implications of the leak and the authorities’ response, are summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps escalation conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the structure is coherent and scaled appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is clean and linear: peaceful status quo, warning, offer of weapon, then a quiet resolution with the dome increasingly framed as haven. Causality holds (tower collapse → enemies → Kael’s warning → fortification), but the central threat never materializes on-page, so the setup of danger pays off mostly in summary rather than in a tested turning point. Closure qualifies as an earned stasis/charged poise image—Elara armed yet peaceful at the dome’s edge—but the cost is only lightly felt. Overall, it’s coherent and functional but not yet gripping or structurally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: Kael observes the disrupted constellations, follows their zigzag, the air shifts, the goddess appears, and the rail spike is revealed as a key, leaving the garden changed. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: the established anomalies (sleepwalking stars, sound-silence) culminate in the goddess’s arrival and the echo’s tethering. Closure is on-page and legible as a resonant reconfiguration: the garden is “whole again” and the echo is bound to place via the spike. The main weakness is that turns feel somewhat convenient rather than pressured—Kael’s actions nudge events, but the decisive changes largely arrive without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible (call → visit → investigation → meeting → symbolic act → decision to publish), and orientation is never in doubt. However, most investigative turns are summarized rather than dramatized, so discoveries feel easy and unresisted. The closure—Eleanor leaving resolved to expose the truth—is a valid Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is faint, mostly conceptual. The structure is competent but not yet tight or pressurized enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense stasis in the lab, backstory of the failed translation, discovery of the letters, decision to answer, and the machines’ hush as closure. Causality is intact and legible—the mistake leads to guilt, which the firmware amplifies, which sets up the letters and the final act of writing. The closure beat, with the lab falling silent, functions as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after and emotional cost. Some mechanics (how the letters function now, to whom the replies are “sent”) are elided, making the middle turn feel a bit convenient rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: discover flake → insert into mandala → revelation of the grotto’s history → reorientation of Elara’s stance. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each move deepens the central situation rather than introducing new threads, and the cause-effect chain is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a changed understanding and a different relationship to the hush and her unease, at a conceptual cost (no comforting “answer”). Some of the backstory about the silenced people is delivered in summary rather than fully dramatized, which slightly blunts the on-page impact of that turn.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is simple and legible: Elara arrives, engages with the mosaic, reflects on the fire and mercy, then reconfigures the mosaic and the plaza’s meaning—an accumulative/textural arc that lands in conceptual repricing. Causality is more thematic than event-driven, and there’s no strong hinge where an on-page event forces a new choice; she essentially continues a preexisting project. Closure exists (plaza transformed from sorrow to hope), but the cost of that reconfiguration is only lightly implied. The reflective passages are anchored to present stimuli, but they don’t significantly alter her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: Mara goes to the garden’s fracture point, uses the tarot coin to summon an echo-self, transfers hope, and the garden’s energy and timeline respond. The piece achieves closure via a resonant reconfiguration—Mara has partially healed the fracture and herself, while remaining bound to repeat this work. Escalation is gentle and somewhat linear, with minimal complication or resistance from the echo-self. Still, the before/after of the garden and of Mara’s purpose is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV, accumulative scene moving from unease to purposeful creation to quiet resolve. Causality is straightforward—news of the recall → need to understand → devising and executing the light painting—and the geode and studio are integrated throughout. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis moment: she has made one map and commits to ongoing healing work. The main weakness is that the “world-scale” stakes of the recall never tighten into any concrete, costly decision on the page, so the before/after line feels conceptually rather than dramatically sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story has a clean causal spine: find fossil → emotional surge → theory about the caves → study fossil → second floating → secret chamber and carvings. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure beat when the chamber activates and redefines her work. Much of the forward motion depends on the fossil acting upon Elara rather than her choices altering options, and the “human hibernation” backstory arrives as a somewhat expository leap. Closure lands conceptually, but the lack of concrete price or narrowed options keeps it out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: bring the jar → catalog buttons → discover the bone button → unlock the echo → leave with a new understanding. The structure suits an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the echo’s meaning reweights prior action. However, the lack of any serious obstacle or reversal means the progression feels more procedural than tense. The ending does mark a before/after, but with only a light sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: following the snow codes leads to the tree, which leads to the letter, which leads to her internal reconfiguration and renewed resolve. The drive reads as a Hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where her stance toward her past and courage shifts. However, the stakes and potential consequences of failure (or of taking the pill) are underdefined, so the decisive moment lacks maximal weight. Orientation is clear throughout; the single scene holds together without temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the crossing, encounter with the figure, realization, and a fog-lifting closure that clearly marks a before/after. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural, with the conversation serving as a hinge into conceptual repricing. However, the central answer is delivered rather than wrestled toward, which flattens causal pressure, and the ticking-gutter time limit never meaningfully constrains action. Closure is present but low-cost and somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is coherent: Elara discovers the glass, experiments with light and sun patterns, realizes the oasis’s nature, then shares it with villagers, leading to healing. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one dominant drive (understanding the oasis) that does lead to a clear conceptual and practical shift. However, obstacles are minimal and the turning points feel more like smooth revelations than pressured decisions, so closure lands as gentle reconfiguration rather than earned transformation with cost. The oasis healing and community forming occur almost entirely in summary, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: discovery of the tooth → eerie stillness → arrival of the boat → recognition and connection. Causality is modest but intact, with the tooth linking Elara to the lockmaster and motivating their encounter. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (they reframe their loneliness and vocation through each other), but the cost is faint and largely implied. The situational pressure (night, hush, waiting harbor) accumulates rather than turns decisively, keeping it short of truly sharp structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: sundial → descent guided by hum → stone door → orb → visions → reconfiguration. Structure holds as a single throughline, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing when she understands the Theraliths are the world and that she is now their bridge. However, obstacles are minimal (the massive stone door opens immediately once the key touches it; the orb’s power is accepted without resistance), softening both cost and tension. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, but it never tightens enough to feel fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece holds together cleanly as a single, causal scene: Elara arrives with a talisman, discovers the installation, inserts the spiral, triggers a transformation, and leaves changed. Orientation is swift and solid, and the chosen accumulative/causal blend is legible through to closure. The ending offers a modest but clear reconfiguration—she leaves the spiral and departs believing she has touched the “thread that connected all things.” The main limitation is that the cost of this change is minimal, so the before/after boundary feels conceptually neat rather than deeply consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear: mysterious signal → pressure from Hank/listeners → Elara’s analysis → subsonic counter → brief victory → widening social conflict → her decision to remain vigilant. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one central scene plus a summarized aftermath, and the closure (a quiet earned stasis/charged poise) is legible if not intense. The major weakness is that the “community divide” and cosmic stakes are mostly summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the sense of cost at the end. Still, the piece satisfies basic closure and coherence requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: compass → archway → passage → chamber → key → organ-melody realization → embracing spatial mutiny and transformed space. Orientation is clear and steady, with one continuous scene and no confusing jumps. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she reorients to her fear and the environment literally reshapes in response. However, the mechanics and stakes of “spatial mutiny” are left abstract, so while the arc is coherent, the magnitude and specificity of the cost/impact on the wider world remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal line is clean: cold case → quarry with ribbon → encounter with figure and second ribbon → drawing and internal reorientation → departure. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing—she reframes her role from solving the case to bridging empathy—but the story never shows a concrete consequence of this pivot. The mysterious figure functions more as atmosphere than as a true structural turn, since their appearance changes little tactically. Overall the structure holds, but the decisive change in options or knowledge is modest and largely interior, with low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is legible: jet stream shift → Elara goes to station → deciphers coded stanzas → uses nail in map → ritual reverses exile → meeting and choice. Structure holds as a single scene with one escalation, but the crucial payoff—“the choice remains—to restore or to protect” and “she made her choice”—is elided, so we never see what *specifically* she chose or how it concretely alters the world beyond a slightly calmer sky. Closure exists, but the decisive change is conceptually gestured at rather than dramatized with a visible on-page price. This softens the sense of before/after and makes the resolution feel a bit too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is straightforward—find flake → interpret clues → trek into wilderness → discover sanctuary—but the escalation feels pre-solved, as if success is inevitable once the object appears. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal quest with accumulative lyric patterning), and closure lands as a Decisive Change when Bridge-Song reaches “pixelated amnesty” and begins to play. However, there’s little on-page resistance or complication; each step is narrated as a smooth progression rather than a pressured sequence of choices. The disappearance as inciting incident is mostly summarized, not structurally tested or deepened in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias comes to the train, investigates the cars, discovers the journal, meets the partner, and leaves with a new understanding. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, but the inciting question (why his father circled back here) is resolved mostly via exposition in Lila’s journal rather than dramatized discovery. Closure does land—a conceptual repricing where the train becomes a lesson rather than a mystery—but the cost of that realization is muted. The drive lens feels predominantly causal with a mild accumulative texture, held consistently but without a strong tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night in the observatory, moving from alignment of telescopes to pattern recognition to thematic realization at dawn. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step (telegram → star rhythms → constellation → plea for unity) builds toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is soft but coherent; nothing breaks, though some beats (realizing the map of “shared burdens”) feel more told than dynamically discovered. Closure is present and legible, even if the cost is only lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: failed magic trick → awakened vortex → Eira finds seed → ritual unbending → confession → seed-plant stabilizes the lake. The story maintains orientation well and delivers a decisive change in both the lake’s state and Eira’s self-understanding. However, the external problem resolves quite smoothly once the confession is spoken, with little sense that failure remains a live option at the climax. The price of success (beyond an internal admission) feels modest relative to the apocalyptic setup of the vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow: clipping → maze → pedestal → covenant restored, with a clear before/after. However, the path is almost frictionless; the maze “reveals its secrets” and the clipping simply guides her, with no meaningful setback or threat to coherence. Closure does land (the covenant mends, harmony restored), but cost is faint and largely historical rather than on-page. Structurally it’s solid but feels more like a mythic summary of a quest than a tested, scene-level struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: routine tending → anomalous tug in the roots → descent to the chamber → confrontation with the figure → reaffirmed, costly choice. Backstory (the traded voice, the earlier bargain) is efficiently anchored in present cues and directly informs the stakes of the confrontation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she consciously re-chooses her binding with awareness of its cost. The structure is straightforward and solid, though the confrontation resolves quickly and could bear one more beat of resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clear, single-scene accumulative structure anchored in the trailer, with orientation solid very early. The causality is simple but coherent: public failure → retreat to quarry → contemplation around the cloth → small forward-looking decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he redefines the cloth and his stance toward purpose), with a legible before/after. The main weakness is relatively soft escalation; the middle reflection reiterates stakes more than it deepens or complicates them.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: study → analogical thinking → planting the seed → visions → tree and fruit → realization and peace. Structure is straightforward single-POV, one arc from curiosity to insight, with a clear before/after conceptual shift about “the physics of transition.” However, the progression feels low-friction: the seed activates immediately, visions arrive without resistance, and the resolution lacks a concrete cost, so the closure is more serene than earned. The drive lens reads as Causal with a mild accumulative texture, and closure is present but not deeply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: destabilized identities → Elara engages the atrium’s mechanisms → runes reconfigure → identities stabilize in altered forms and she reframes the outcome. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a clear progression toward closure and no orientation issues. The closure—accepting transformation rather than full restoration—is legible, but the resolution arrives without meaningful complication or failed attempt, so the arc feels somewhat frictionless for the scale of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: inspection → pearl → pull into chamber → crown activation → new mission, and the single-scene structure is easy to follow. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a redefined sense of purpose and task. The cost of that shift is mostly conceptual, however, with no concrete repercussion for abandoning her original mandate or risking anything in the caves. As a result, the before/after is clear but not sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: arrival → exploration → graffiti recognition → encounter → renewed engagement with her map, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat tightens around the “map/forgiveness” idea and her willingness to confront her past. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from archivist of others’ stories to tentative cartographer of her own, with the cost (confronting pain) legible. The turn is quiet, and the causal stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual rather than dramatically tested, which keeps it below elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: arrival → entry → following the hum → writing → departure, with no orientation issues. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a charged object and a new mission, making a before/after state clear. However, the journey unfolds almost frictionlessly, with each step granted rather than contested, so the decisive moment of documenting feels inevitable but not hard-won. The drive lens reads mainly causal with some accumulative lyricism, but escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: research → coffee-stain divination → realization of stakes → decision to play → plants neutralize scouts and violin is spent. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and the scene holds a single, coherent window to closure. The closure unit (she chooses the dream over the empire and sacrifices the violin’s power) lands clearly with a legible before/after. The only structural softness is the large-scale world stakes being mostly told rather than materially advanced beyond this localized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: single scene, clear causal line (chip → resurrection → lesson → inner shift) and a coherent closure where Elara reorients from sparks to stillness. The global stakes (world unraveling) mostly sit in the background and don’t actively tighten options in scene. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing, but the lack of a concrete price or foreclosed path blunts impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: hairpin → map → shell → lake → visions → new understanding → return, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elara reframes contentment and her life’s cycle after witnessing her past lives. However, the structure is almost entirely problem-free—there are no genuine setbacks or complications once the hairpin activates, and the passage through the lake feels like a smooth, inevitable initiation rather than a pressured choice. The design is coherent and readable but lacks the structural tension and felt cost that would make it stand out in a competitive market.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias arrives with a task, consults the chimes, writes the letter, and departs, with the shard as a recurring object that ties beginning and end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of observation → interpretation → inscription coheres and closure is legible as a quiet reconfiguration. However, escalation is minimal; no beat meaningfully narrows his options or complicates the task. The cloak-of-doubt problem is declared more than felt, and its “resolution” depends on faith in the letter rather than on-page change.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single meditative scene that accumulates pressure toward a choice to reveal, with the two stones bracketing the key beats. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: the trance and visions arising from the ripples push her into confession. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she shifts from protective secrecy to open revelation with some emotional cost. Stakes remain largely internal and conceptual, so the decisive change lands more in idea than in felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: wait for the flock, read the patterns, reinterpret the arrowhead, then turn inward, giving a clear before/after conceptual shift. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and closure lands via conceptual repricing when the arrowhead becomes a compass to states of being. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, but the ending moment of earned stasis/charged poise is legible and satisfying. There are no orientation or causality breaks, though the lack of external complication keeps the plot relatively thin.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the quest for the keystone leads to the spire, the trap, the harness, mist walking, and contact with the keystone, culminating in a reflective descent. Closure is present—Eli’s perspective on magic changes in a legible before/after. However, escalation resolves quickly and conveniently once he activates the harness, and the trap’s danger dissipates without much friction or price. The larger frame of the automated world does not return in a structurally consequential way beyond the final reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is clean: key → underwater light → hatch → library → book → vow → re-seeing the sky lanterns, with a clear before/after in his stance. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he consciously commits to a quest, and his world is reinterpreted through “luminous vows.” However, the path is almost frictionless—every threshold (hatch, stairs, library, book) yields without resistance, so the journey feels like a guided tour rather than pressured choice. The cost of his new commitment is only implied and never tangibly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is clean: coins/prophecy → distillation attempt → essence appears → prophecy reinterpreted as roadmap, giving clear causal linkage under a mostly causal/accumulative lens. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the piece holds a single scene with one dominant throughline. Closure exists as a reconfiguration (Lira now understands how to use coins + essence to follow the prophecy), but the cost and consequence of this shift remain abstract and future-tense. There are no serious causality breaks, yet escalation is gentle and the decisive change feels more like the first step of a synopsis than a hard-earned, high-stakes turn.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene arc: observatory → activation of the ritual → crystallization/naming → conceptual reorientation. Causality is intact and legible—placing the atlas page on the platform triggers the runes, which triggers the apparitions, which enables her thematic insight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from purposeless wandering to a recommitment to her role, now reframed by what sacrifice means. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural but with enough causal linkage that the before/after is clear and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: study viaduct → devise “dripping rates” → rebuild bell → hang it → waves return, giving a clear before/after closure. Structure is linear and easy to follow within one continuous scene, with no orientation or lens issues. However, the resolution comes on the first attempt with no setback or complication, making the supposed “cosmic imbalance” feel surprisingly easy to fix. Closure exists but the lack of resistance softens its impact and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal line (find label → follow photo trail → discover bottle/history → create exhibit → communal response) is clean and easy to follow. Structure is straightforward, almost outline-simple, with one main turn when he chooses to use the found objects to intervene in town life. Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s stance toward its past is reweighted and symbolized by the framed label. The missing piece is cost—nothing seriously resists him or complicates the plan, so the resolution feels a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clean and linear: seek crystal → decode starlings → find crystal → follow flame → altar transformation → realization, with an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she redefines herself and her path, but the journey is almost obstacle-free, with no turn that meaningfully narrows options or raises cost. The flame and altar arrive conveniently rather than emerging from prior pressure or choice. Overall, the structure is coherent and readable but dramatically underpowered for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal spine is legible: the seeker climbs, observes, revises their interpretation of a pattern, decodes it, and descends at dawn with the mission complete. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pressure building via atmosphere and repetition rather than concrete external events. Closure exists—a successful deciphering and a reaffirmed ongoing burden—but the before/after shift feels mild and largely conceptual, with little sense of real risk or sacrifice. No orientation problems, but the decisive change is undercharged.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael arrives with a goal, Lira frames the choice, the duel tests it, and the shattering of the jar decisively resolves the conflict. The piece maintains a single coherent scene, with the dojo outside time serving as a stable frame and a clear before/after in Kael’s state. However, the “duel” itself remains somewhat abstract and metaphorical, with little specific tactic or complication beyond “it intensifies,” so escalation feels schematic. Cost at closure (loss of the separate duplicate self, risk of failure) is more implied than concretely rendered, keeping this below elite-level structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: seed → planting → key → experiments → brook → hidden door → chamber, with no major logic gaps. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main transition from first night to later days of study. Closure is present—he discovers the chamber and implicitly accepts an expanded role—but the resolution is almost entirely gain with little visible price. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a mild situational aura, and that holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is clean: song → leaf blower → rising effort → altered echoes → faint laughter yields a legible before/after reconfiguration. Causality is simple but coherent, and the closure (hearing laughter and stepping out with hope) is clearly on the page. However, the progression feels inevitable and unchallenged, with little sense that any choice could fail or re-route the outcome. The “after the final grain slipped” time marker never materially shapes options or tactics, blunting structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: pendant appears → Elara follows its pull to the garden → keeper reveals the pendant’s function and cost → Elara decides to wait. The scene stays in one coherent window with no orientation issues, and the closure as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise is on the page with a legible before/after. The main weakness is that the consequences to the garden/library, while stated, remain conceptual rather than dramatized, softening the felt weight of the choice. Still, for this length the structure is solid and the drive lens (situational with causal beats) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: years of failed vivification → focus on the crozier → conceptual pivot → ritual → sapling and redefined purpose. Structure-wise it’s a single continuous scene with interleaved reflection and a clear decisive change at the end. The closure unit (shifting from undoing death to creating from remnants) lands, but the cost is modest and the ritual’s success feels almost guaranteed once begun, so tension around the climax is limited. No major orientation or lens issues; this reads as a straightforward causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene building from setup (city, shard, task) through tuning attempts to a clear closure where the city “reborn” and Elara’s understanding shift the frame. Causality is coherent—her decisions to adjust the tuning and discard assumptions directly affect the shard’s behavior and the city’s awakening. However, escalation is modest and there is no substantial complication beyond the brief dimming of the shard, so the arc feels more like a smooth ramp than a pressured turn with cost. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of silence and endings, but without a strong felt price attached.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: vanished ferry → patterns in grotto → decision to enter rift → chamber with frozen ferry → hourglass reset → return. Structure (grotto → rift → ferry → grotto) is clean and closure lands with a decisive change: timelines merged, rift sealed, ferry restored, Mara weakened. The main weakness is how conveniently the solution unfolds once she’s in the rift—no real setbacks or complications—and the hourglass continuity glitch (given away, then used by her) undercuts some of the earned feel. Cost is present but light and somewhat generic, relying on summary (“forever changed”) rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Elara arrives with a goal, tests her power, triggers the gallery’s eruption, faces a warning, chooses to deepen the weaving, then exits altered. Causality is legible—her weaving causes the illusions’ escalation and the appearance of the shadow man, and his question drives the central decision. Closure is solidly on the page: she emerges with the tangled thread and a reweighted understanding of connection’s cost and value. The stakes and turns are modest rather than razor-edged, but there are no structural or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear and linear: harbor → Council threat relayed → pedagogical response → time-skip → reconfigured status quo and closing image. Causality is intact (Council’s fear prompts her counter-move with students) and the ending constitutes a soft Resonant Reconfiguration, with horizons reconceived inward as well as outward. However, the supposed decommissioning threat never tightens on the page—“weeks turned into months, and the navigation towers remained standing” deflates potential closure cost. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, but the causal spine is somewhat under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: hearing aid → call to “find the last photograph” → tracking pulses → discovery → commitment to “protect her story.” Structure is linear and appropriate for the length, with a clear beginning, middle search, and reflective closure. However, escalation is minimal; each step unfolds as expected with no meaningful complication, reversal, or narrowing of options. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: return → descent → vault → codex → phase realm → revelation → return to surface, with no major orientation issues. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a conceptual repricing at the end, and closure is solid: she acquires the codex and a reconfigured understanding of the cables/unseen. Cost is more internal and conceptual than materially dramatized, but it is legible. Structure (single throughline with one surreal shard) suits the length and holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the death certificate and shard lead to noticing the ink patterns, which leads to defragmentation, the ghost’s emergence, and a reframed sense of self. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a clear rise from eerie observation to supernatural/technical revelation and then to emotional resolution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets her existence and relationship to the “system,” with the shard and ink motifs closed off elegantly. Stakes stay almost entirely internal and the process of solving the problem (defragmenting) is almost frictionless, which limits structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival at canyon → decision to enter tunnel → deciphering echoes → using the diamond → shattering it to save the language. Orientation is strong from the outset and the drive lens (causal with some accumulative texture) holds through to closure. The ending provides an on-page decisive change with cost—the diamond destroyed, Lira altered, and the canyon reconfigured as repository of the language. Still, the path from problem to solution is straightforward and lightly contested, with few complications beyond the expected “curse drains her,” which caps the narrative sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain (search → find arrowhead → phone call → metamorphosis → cryptid vision → inner shift) is coherent and easy to follow. The Hybrid lens (external rupture enabling internal repricing) holds through the ending, with a clear before/after in Lena’s stance. However, major mechanics (the arrowhead’s dimensional ability, the cryptids “awakening,” the imperative “Metamorphose. Now.”) feel more declared than earned, and their rules are loose. Closure exists but the cost is muted and mostly conceptual, lessening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: music as defiance → locust shell as key/signal → synchronization → orchard uprising → statues’ fall, with a clear Decisive Change and restored orchard at the end. The single-scene structure is coherent and orientation is solid early on. However, the resolution feels relatively unchallenged—once Elara guesses the mechanism, there are no meaningful setbacks or complications before success. The cost of victory is minimal on the page, which slightly blunts structural impact at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal spine is clean: object entrusted → drone launch → surveillance gauntlet → chase → delivery → release. Orientation is solid and the scene progression is easy to follow. Closure is on-page (bottle opened, sky mended, brief truce, Elias retreats with altered hope), but the resolution leans on the bottle’s magic in a way that softens felt cost and makes the climax almost frictionless. The structure is sound but not yet taut enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causality is straightforward: he finds the fragment, follows the bells, discovers the oasis, sings, magic happens, and he leaves changed. The structure is cleanly linear with clear orientation and a discernible climax at the song/halo-burst moment, followed by brief denouement. However, the beats read more like stages in a fable than genuine turns under pressure, and the “wrong turn” and hidden compartment feel conveniently discovered rather than pressured. Closure lands conceptually (reframing silence) but cost is only lightly implied and not concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: mission → geometric rearrangements → awakening → crossing → discovery → return, with a legible before/after and a clear Resonant Reconfiguration when she becomes the library’s guardian. Causality is straightforward (her specific actions unlock the portal), and the accumulative ritual pattern holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. The passage into the “place where stories lived” happens smoothly with no real resistance or complication, which softens the sense of hard-won closure. Cost at the end is implied more than dramatized, so the final shift is resonant but not fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—predawn setup, uncanny light, painting-portal, internal reconfiguration—is coherent and easy to follow. The closure unit (a conceptual repricing: seeking not the old dream but the courage to make a new one) is on the page and clearly tied to what precedes it. That said, the cost of this shift remains abstract; we’re told the cipher “unravels,” but don’t concretely feel what she relinquishes or risks. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, yet the ending reads more as graceful resolution than pressured crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear: star hint → crafted key → vault entry → orb → release of the idea. Structure is cleanly one scene with a legible build to the orb and a decisive act at the end, so closure is present. The cost of releasing an idea that can “save or destroy the world” remains theoretical; we don’t see even a small-scale consequence or new constraint in the final beat. Under a causal lens, the pressure on that choice feels underdeveloped relative to the stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mushrooms → missing one → locket → photograph/message → constellation pattern → charged final stance. The piece delivers a modest but coherent closure (Charged Poise) as she realizes this place is the nexus of her lost past and future search. However, the plotting leans on convenient discovery (perfectly placed locket, photo in same greenhouse) without friction, and the cost of this revelation is mostly implied nostalgia rather than an on-page sacrifice. Structure is linear and solid but not especially intricate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: Elara engages the shard-mirror, performs her tea-leaf annotation, and the mirror’s status shifts from prison to portal. Causality is accumulative rather than dramatic but coherent: her focused work leads to the shadow softening and her stance reconfiguring. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (she now sees the artifact and her ongoing task differently), but the cost is subtle and largely conceptual. No orientation or lens-clarity debts; the drive lens reads as accumulative/textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a simple, coherent arc: Elara prepares, plants the heirloom seed, performs the ritual, and witnesses its success. Structure is clean and linear, but the drive is largely accumulative/lyric rather than causal, with minimal complication or reversal. Closure is present—Elara’s role as “guardian of wonder” is affirmed in a new, ritualized way—but there is almost no visible cost or real doubt the ritual will work. This keeps the story pleasant yet dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the sanctuary where work on the net escalates from first knot to stubborn knot to release, with no orientation issues. Causality is straightforward—each knot leads to more voices and finally to a cathartic flood—fitting an accumulative/textural drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the net is fully unraveled, the whispers cease, and Elara’s sense of purpose reframes from mere grounding to honoring stories, with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear: misalignment in the footage inspires suspicion, which leads to excavation and the chapel’s discovery, giving solid if unsurprising closure. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with no orientation issues and a clean single-POV throughline. However, crucial beats (the extended excavation, any setbacks) are summarized (“Hours turned into days”) rather than dramatized, softening the sense of earned resolution. The closure (chapel found, Elara’s new role) lands, but with low felt cost or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: snow globe → journal/map → deeper room/letter → realization and release, with an accumulative lens that holds to the end. Causality is low-key but coherent—each discovery leads concretely to the next without teleporting props or logic gaps. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she shifts from seeking to “understand death” to embracing impermanence, with the act of leaving the globe behind marking the before/after. Stakes stay modest and cerebral, which is fine for this mode, but there’s minimal sense of risk or cost beyond the intellectual/emotional insight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost’s appearances → Elara’s investigation → recognition of the bolt plate as key → timed ritual during storm → ghost’s release and Elara’s reorientation of purpose. The piece maintains a single scene frame with integrated backstory and lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration: she moves from solitary, seldom-heard singer to someone who understands her role as mediator for “ghosts in the code.” However, the cost at closure is soft; the ghost’s departure reads poignant but painless, and nothing substantial in her options is foreclosed. Structurally it’s sound and publishable, but the ending could bear more consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: diary → elevator ascent → floor-by-floor discoveries → key → decryption → emotional shift. The ten-floor structure provides an effective, legible progression, and the closure (her conceptual revaluation of joy/anguish) is clearly on the page. The steps feel a bit too frictionless—each floor yields what she needs without complication—so escalation and the cost of the resolution are somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: gondola failure strands her, she perceives the anomalous cloud, chooses to leap, experiences revelation, and returns changed. Causality is mostly intact under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, but the hint of deliberate sabotage or intent behind the failure is never paid off, creating a dangling setup. The leap appears to be a major causal decision, yet the consequence is an immediate restoration of safety (fixed string, steady gondola), softening the sense of permanent change or price. Closure as conceptual repricing lands, but with low narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: coin → search in the tree → discovery of the mechanism → decoding and crafting → building shudder. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the piece maintains a single continuous scene that lands in a clear before/after at the end. Closure is present as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—she succeeds, the building begins to collapse, and her relation to endings shifts. The main limitation is that the “imminent demolition” clock is underused in the middle, dulling structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: deciphering the hopscotch board triggers the glow, which reveals the beam, hatch, descent, and the chamber with the map, landing in a clear closure image. Structure is straightforward single-POV progression with one spatial transition and no orientation issues. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elara gains the map and a new sense of not being alone—but the cost is soft and the outcome comes a bit too easily once the board activates. There are no serious plot gaps, but pressure and consequence remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: decoding prophecies → discovering the door → entering the hall → confronting mirrors → returning with the gears. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure unit when she emerges changed and resumes work. The main weakness is the underdeveloped cost: the ominous “no one had ever returned” never truly cashes out in a concrete risk or sacrifice. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a steady causal spine, but the climax does not fully tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: fading nebula → ghost’s message → quest to the garden → restoration of bell → nebula’s return and Elara’s departure. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive, on-page climax. However, the path from problem to solution is smooth—each needed element (larvae, memory of clapper, life-giving song) appears just when required, without setbacks or difficult trade-offs. Closure is firm but the lack of genuine complication or visible price keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that escalates from quiet work to a glowing, reality-altering culmination. Cause-and-effect is coherent (her patterns and blood → lighthouse responding → puppet mending → beam steadying). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is temporarily held together with an explicit before/after in the puppet’s state and the lighthouse beam. The cost is present but mostly conceptual and emotional, so the ending is strong rather than overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    Cause and effect are clean: discovery of the nut’s power → assembling impressions into a map → using the map to save a traveler → using the nut to weaken the curse. The piece fits a single-POV, single-arc causal design, and orientation in time and space is strong from the opening. Closure lands via a Decisive Change/RR hybrid—Elara reorients her purpose and the orchard bud appears—but the cost is mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized; nothing is visibly lost or risked beyond generic danger. A hair more friction or consequence around the rescue or the bud’s emergence would deepen the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: river, foam, and chrysalis build toward a single internal reconfiguration. Causality is clear—observation of the foam leads to conceptual reframing, then to the decision to climb out and re-engage with life. Closure (a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration) lands cleanly with a before/after stance on grief, though the cost remains more implied than sharply felt. Structure is straightforward and cohesive, with no orientation debt or major plot artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal—vial scattered → ascent → incision → opening the book → library’s transformation—and the closure is legible as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the piece holds one scene and one lens. However, obstacles are largely nominal and success feels foregone, so the decisive act lacks tension. The cost of her choice never bites; the world changes but no serious alternative or risk is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: tidal pool analysis → descent → corridor-by-corridor work → shard confrontation → dissolution and emergence at dawn, with no orientation issues. The closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change: the pavilion dissolves and Elara emerges lighter, having absorbed cost herself. That said, each step unfolds without serious complication or reversal; nothing meaningfully threatens failure or forces a new tactic beyond moving deeper. Structurally it’s elegant and coherent but feels more like a stately ritual than a pressured quest.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara goes to the clock with a goal, prepares the weight, sings, the clock wakes, the town gathers, and communal healing begins. The piece offers solid closure with the clock restored and the community reconfigured, fitting a Causal lens with a touch of lyric accumulation. However, there are no real obstacles or complications; everything unfolds in a straightforward success path. The structure is coherent and contained to one arc, but lacks a turn that meaningfully constrains options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: she arrives with a broken object, modifies it, activates it, and reaches a clear new stance—an accumulative, reflection-led design with a legible Charged Poise closure. Causality is simple but coherent, with no orientation problems. However, the risk and cost attached to the process stay largely theoretical; nothing on the page forces a hard trade-off or tests her resolve beyond contemplation. The result is a satisfying but somewhat low-intensity arc rather than a fully gripping structural progression.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wait for the inversion, enter the grotto, follow the doodle, unlock the pedestal, obtain the seed. The structure is linear and easy to follow with a clear before/after at the end. However, obstacles are minimal and every setup pays off without resistance, so the turns feel more procedural than truly pressured. Closure is present but relatively low-cost: she gains what she wants with no significant loss or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean and legible: hedgehog uncurls → she begins work → engagement with cracks and insulator → finished sculpture at dawn, with a clear before/after in the grove’s “silence.” The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the world is reweighted from “silent” to “quiet but musical.” Causality is soft but coherent; each step follows ritual rather than conflict-based necessity, which limits felt stakes. The main weakness is the absence of any meaningful obstacle or turn that complicates or redirects her process.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one scene at the nexus, reflection on exile, the chess sequence, and a conceptual turn culminating in the toppled king and decision to return. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—nexus → intensified thoughts → chess pattern → new stance. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing of exile and the covenant, but the cost is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, and there’s little sense that alternatives were ever dangerously viable. Overall functional and clear, but not structurally daring or sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: preparation → ritual with the clasp → opening → reading/realization → reflective closure, with no orientation issues. The accumulative drive (texture and atmosphere intensifying toward a realization) holds consistently, and the final realization about empathy and identity is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Still, the central hurdle—the clasp opening—is resolved without setback or real uncertainty, so the sense of cost and narrative tightening is mild. The piece reads more like a well-shaped vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and linear: seed planted → tide of thought and journaling → dreams/heightened sensitivity → first scent → realization and aftermath, with a legible before/after in her stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of ambition vs. serenity. Stakes and cost are modest—nothing material is at risk—so the change feels meaningful but not urgent. Causality is soft-mystical yet internally coherent, with no major orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: arrow tip → map → grove → stone → restoration, with a clear before/after in the planet’s state. Orientation is strong; we always know where we are in relation to river, arches, and inversion. Closure lands, but the path is almost frictionless: obstacles are mentioned conceptually (failing instruments, chaotic inversion) without becoming meaningful plot tests. The weakening core and fading echoes raise stakes, yet the solution arrives straightforwardly once the map is revealed, so structural tension is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: storm → container funnel → aircraft’s doomed landing → Elara’s reconstruction, culminating in a conceptual shift about foreseeability. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the single-scene investigation structure is easy to follow. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: the town’s silence is re-read as the cost of systemic failure. The main weakness is how tidy and uncontested the reconstruction feels, with no serious false lead or resistance before the final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: preparation, invocation through bells and aurora, then the manifestation of the sculpted hush and resolution. Causality holds, but the supposedly precise timeframe (“at the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble”) functions more as flavor than as an active constraint on tactics. Escalation is mostly linear accumulation rather than a meaningful turn that narrows options. Closure is present and legible, but the path to it feels relatively untested given the lofty stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is straightforward and coherent: follow markers → find flute → choose to play → arrive in new realm, with no orientation issues. The piece delivers a Decisive Change (she crosses into another world and re-commits to her mission), but the path there is almost frictionless. The disastrous backstory stakes are invoked but never materially re-tested in the present scene beyond a brief hesitation, so the closure’s cost is conceptually more than dramatically earned. Structurally it’s clean but feels like the first chapter of a quest, not a fully pressurized short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-sitting experiment: preparation → deliberate self-disorientation → overwhelming influx → recovery and reframed stance. Causality is clear (he chooses to blur himself; therefore the empathy surge nearly unmoors him; therefore he must re-ground and reinterpret his project), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration. Still, the arc leans heavily on interior description rather than externalized beats, which keeps the stakes feeling conceptual rather than sharply staged. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds, but the cost at closure remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal line—delivery task → increasing humming → scholar’s revelation → reconfigured sense of role—is clean and easy to follow within a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara leaves altered in her relation to relics and to the “fade.” That said, the decisive turn largely arrives via the scholar’s explanation rather than a pressured choice, and the cost of this new alignment remains mostly conceptual, not dramatized. The structure is solid and publishable but not yet structurally daring or sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from preparation to communion to realization to reorientation. Causality is coherent—her experiment leads directly to contact with grief, which forces a reframing of her theory and purpose. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: she recognizes the cost and depth of what she’s studying and commits to continue with new humility. Stakes remain small and mostly intellectual/emotional, which keeps the arc low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is clean: loom work → puzzle discovery → journey following puzzle → final piece → bridge and crossing, with a clear before/after at the ending. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change and conceptual reframe as she becomes the message itself, with the cost of her old life implied. Some mechanics (how the puzzle guides, how the silence operates as a “fabric”) stay abstract, which keeps the stakes a bit hazy. Nonetheless, the structure holds together and lands a legible, contained transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: stranger arrives → bargain struck → descent into mines → ritual at the core → planetary renewal and altered self. The structure is essentially linear with one clear escalation into the depths, and closure is a Decisive Change with visible external consequences. The major weakness is that the descent and ritual are summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat, softening the sense of concrete obstacles and tactical adaptation. The cost of losing his own “awakening” is conceptually important but under-specified on the page, making the before/after emotionally less sharp than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: shard → forest → second shard → merged orb → revelation of her guardian role. Structure is straightforward with one main transition and a clear conceptual closure where her understanding of self and the setting reconfigures. However, the key turns are mostly delivered via exposition (the woman explaining, the orb projecting) rather than dramatized struggle, so the decisive change lacks felt cost. As a result, the closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but doesn’t hit with the depth or complexity expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: lamp flickers → sea glass message → stone code → hidden compartment → letters → conceptual turn about safety and duty, concluding with relighting the lamp at dawn. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Elias reinterprets his role and the lighthouse’s purpose, and the before/after is legible. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (accepting responsibility and secrecy) rather than dramatized as a concrete sacrifice, which keeps it in the solid but not exceptional band. Structure stays within a single night-to-dawn arc with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation and causal flow are clear: tending the wick → beam misbehaves → fog/gateway → beings arrive and reframe the routine. The piece lands a valid closure via resonant reconfiguration: the Herald’s work is reinterpreted as a bridge between worlds. However, the central turn (“they understood. This was no accident.”) comes through explanatory narration rather than dramatized discovery, softening impact. Cost at the ending is largely conceptual, with no concrete loss or foreclosed option to sharpen the before/after divide.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the tea house, moving from contemplation to encounter to departure, with clear causal links (wing → vision of threads → approach to woman → conversation → renewed mission). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael crystallizes his role as a tracker of “sun trails” and stories, and the story’s before/after is legible. However, stakes and obstacles are soft; nothing in the scene seriously threatens his goal or complicates his gift, so the decisive turn feels gentle rather than gripping. The donor heart backstory is introduced and then mostly unused structurally, feeling more like flavor than a true driver of events.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous sequence from corridor to tower to resolution, with clear spatial and temporal anchors and no causality breaks. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from noticing the sextant to deconstructing it to witnessing its healing, culminating in a conceptual repricing of sorrow and witness. That said, the escalation feels low-pressure; no alternative paths or genuine risk complicate his course of action. Closure is present but relatively soft, with cost only abstractly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mica shard → mirror world → search for song fragments → recovered lullaby → realm rekindled. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one clear transition between worlds and a legible return that provides Decisive Change closure. The main weakness is how smoothly everything resolves; no significant setback or complication tests the plan once the quest is underway, and costs are largely absent. Still, the before/after of a dead vs. rekindled realm is clear and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara discovers the invitation, consults Thaddeus, researches, reaches the hidden chamber, encounters the blank book, and reframes her life. This delivers a modest but coherent closure where she adopts a new stance about her paradoxes and role in the world. Still, the plot remains very low-tension and largely linear, with few complications or tests of her new resolve. The closure reads more like a gentle conceptual shift than a turn under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: Elara discovers the bread, tends the garden, uncovers the plaque, and arrives at a quiet emotional resolution in the tea house. Causality is coherent, but the turns are gentle, with no real complication or narrowing of options—everything unfolds as confirmation rather than challenge. The closure (the plaque and the sense of peace) functions as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the cost of reaching it is only lightly implied. Structurally sound but low-tension, limiting its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single, coherent scene: unusual slide → projection → tremor/shift → new inscription → renewed sense of mission, with no orientation issues. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes the library and her role—but the decisive change is largely conceptual and the cost is soft, mostly an abstract urgency. The causal link between her stepping into the light and the slide’s transformation is clear enough, but the escalation and resolution feel slightly frictionless, with no real obstacle or risk testing that change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward: theft → investigation → confrontation → dawn realization, and the single-scene structure is clear and coherent. However, the crucial “thwarting” of the thieves is summarized (“She’d thwarted the thieves, not with force, but with words and wit”) rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of an earned turn. Closure exists as a conceptual repricing of trust and her role, but the external problem’s resolution feels underdeveloped. The “truce of hush” and its actual operational stakes remain more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: ring tingles → follows sensory cues → discovers convergence clearing → receives revelation → commits to go to the election. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the single-scene progression is easy to follow. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment—she steps forward with a new sense of purpose—though the decisive change is more conceptual than dramatically pressured. Cost at the ending is muted, since no serious alternative path or risk has been articulated or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: paralysis at the blank canvas → discovery of the hidden painting and note → decision to paint anew → symbolic reconfiguration of the cave and lock. Causality is consistent and easy to follow, with no orientation problems. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid, with Elara choosing a new mode of creation and symbolically breaking with the old. The main limitation is that the cost of this change remains mostly implied rather than sharply tested or dramatized in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the map → aligning it with the plate → descending to the chamber → learning the truth → inscribing a new plate → tremor and water. Closure lands as a conceptual and practical shift (she uncovers the sacrifice of the oasis and initiates renewal), with a legible before/after. However, obstacles are minimal and the hidden chamber yields its revelations with little resistance, softening the sense of earned cost. The Causal lens holds, but the journey feels more like a guided uncovering than a pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece follows a clean, linear structure: she arrives/works, the sculpture activates, the bells sound, and she departs, with orientation and causal steps always legible. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, there is one modest deepening as the iceberg glows brighter and the music peaks, but no true complication or narrowing of options. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—her work is done “for now,” and she will return when needed—yet the ending lacks a felt price. The result is structurally coherent but dramatically low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: pole shift heightens inner dissonance → she chooses to open the box → unleashed fears force miniaturization → resolution with cost. The story maintains a single continuous scene with a clear before/after and on-page closure (she has contained the fears but paid a memory-price). Some beats—especially the miniaturization struggle—are summarized rather than fully dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of tactical evolution under pressure. Still, the structure is coherent and scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: mailbox sound → curiosity → encounter with Mrs. Ellis → discovery of the key → opening the mailbox → reading the letter, with a legible before/after shift in Clara’s sense of purpose. The piece maintains a single scene with good temporal and spatial clarity, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (Clara’s role reframed around listening and healing). The main weakness is how conveniently the key appears in the locket at the exact moment she looks, which softens the sense of earned resolution. Still, for its scope, the structure is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: descent into the lab → discovery of the anomalous chamber and journal → interpretive dance that awakens mechanisms → renewed exploration with clearer purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she has literally and figuratively “awakened” the lab and aligned herself with its legacy—but the cost of this change remains abstract and largely untested. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with no orientation lapses. What’s missing for higher marks is a turn where options genuinely narrow or a visible price is paid for her progress.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: preparation in the chamber → ritual using patterns → entry into the memory-space → return with new knowledge, forming a clear causal chain. The drive lens reads mainly as causal with some accumulative texture from motifs; closure is a conceptual repricing (memories are “misplaced,” not erased) that is legible. However, the “what happened next was beyond description” ellipsis sidesteps dramatizing the pivotal transformation, softening both cost and impact. Stakes are modest and the central problem resolves cleanly without any lingering structural tension, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: Elara prepares, performs a ritual, encounters resistance, then succeeds in sealing the prophecy. Closure is on-page and legible as a completed rite with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending (the prophecy is contained but fragile). However, stakes remain mostly declared rather than dramatized, and the resistance beat is brief and abstract (“thrashing like a trapped animal”) without complicating tactics. Structure is sound but not structurally surprising or especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias appears, recontextualizes the seal and Clara’s isolation, sets a concrete task, and she acts on it the next morning. The single-scene rooftop conversation leading to an action the next day is structurally sound and easy to follow, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she begins the “borrowing sugar” path), though the cost is implied rather than strongly dramatized. The piece could gain power from one more tightening turn or complication of Clara’s decision before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: legend → garden → shell → memory-vision → reconfigured understanding and return. The vision-space functions as a second shard but transitions legibly, and the ending offers a clear before/after conceptual change with the cost of carrying others’ memories. Some elements (the shell’s choice of her, the rules of this memory-archive) are accepted without much friction, keeping stakes a little abstract. Still, closure lands and the structure fits the length and mode well.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara enters the sanctuary with the scroll and thorn, hesitates, decides, erases, and exits changed, with the stalactites and aurora bracketing the scene. The global drive is primarily causal with accumulative texture: each physical move with the thorn releases emotional weight, culminating in a decisive internal shift. Closure (DC with a touch of RR) is legible: the letter is gone, and her stance toward her work and her past is reconfigured. The structure is simple but coherent, with no orientation issues or broken set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is clean: a linear progression from wandering → archway → chamber → vision → reoriented exit, with a legible before/after in her understanding. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component; causality is simple but coherent (her singing and courage grant access). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of “echoes” and her purpose, though the truth is delivered with little friction or sense of potential refusal. The “progressive disclosure” is mostly told rather than dramatized as hard-won, softening the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: find snow globe → go to shrine → use dream method → assemble family story → ritual closure, with the dawn providing a neat temporal arc. The dreams from distant strangers are an effective structural device and are well integrated. Closure lands via a quiet resonant reconfiguration when the globe clears and the family’s names are spoken, though the price of that work is only lightly sketched. The structure is coherent and satisfying but not yet surprising or demanding in its turns.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single contemplative scene with a clean beginning–middle–end and a clear closure beat where she reinterprets herself as part of the hidden pattern. The drive lens is accumulative/textural—details and reflections stack until they crystallize in the final paragraphs. However, there’s little causal tightening: nothing in the environment really forces the turn, so the closing realization reads as gently emergent rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → anomaly observation → diamond resonance → letter revelations → “prison” realization → sealing attempt and partial success with cost. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the climax (pressing the diamond into the earth) delivers on the earlier setups. The mechanism of containment via chanting from letters is somewhat convenient and expository, but not enough to break plausibility. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she stabilizes the threat but cannot end it, and the world’s cost is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term listening → new frequency → deciphering → activation of the portico → aftermath. Structure is straightforward with one temporal jump (“Over the following weeks”) that remains legible, and closure lands in the new dawn image. However, much of the “deciphering” and world transformation is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens the sense of on-page cost. The ending’s Decisive Change is clear but the build feels a bit outline-like in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: enter the loft → attempt to capture a resistant box → breakthrough note → uncontrolled flood of music → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is coherent under a lyric, slightly magical logic, and the closure—his realization that redemption lies in remembering, sealed by the shard—lands on the page with a clear before/after. Stakes stay intimate but legible: his identity and purpose as translator of generations. The main limitation is that the cost of this transformation is mostly implied, not sharply tested in a decisive on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: strange vibration → retrieval of the key → approach of the figure → moral/cosmic pitch → exposure of deceit → use of the key to repel. Structure is linear, easy to follow, and delivers an on-page closure in the form of a repelled antagonist and reaffirmed role. However, the “world is out of tune” stake is largely told rather than truly tested on the page, and the resolution feels low-cost for such grandiose stakes. The ending’s “battle isn’t over” note provides forward charge but reads familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear beginning (start of winter work), middle (observation and mapping), and end (realization on the viaduct and spread of her teachings). Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara shifts stances and the world around her subtly reorients. Yet most turns occur via summary rather than scene, and the “patient revolution” unfolds offstage, muting a sense of earned cost or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: she investigates the collapse, notices anomalous scratches, finds the journal, deciphers symbols, discovers the chamber, and uncovers evidence tying her mentor to corruption. This delivers a functional closure unit (RR/CR) where her understanding and future path clearly shift. Yet each step arrives with little resistance or complication, so the investigation feels conveniently smooth and the conspiracy evidence (photo and note) a bit too easily uncovered. The cost of what she’s learned is conceptually large but not operationalized in the final beats beyond a promise of future struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story has a clean, causal throughline: Elias brings the heart for repair, Alistair fixes it, and this catalyzes Elias’s decision to act on Thomas’s case. Orientation is excellent and the structure—one continuous scene with a clear beginning, middle, and end—is solid. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment: Elias leaves with the ticking heart and a new stance, though the practical stakes of his forthcoming “storm” remain abstract. The cost of his decision is implied rather than dramatized, which keeps the structure effective but not fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: workshop → long effort with the kaleidoscope → recurring bell motif → algorithm stabilization → bell manifestation and ringing → world’s response → reflection and renewed commitment. Orientation is solid from the opening; the drive lens reads mainly as causal with some accumulative texture. Closure is present—she achieves her abstract goal and the world subtly reconfigures in response—but the cost of this success is underplayed, so the before/after line, while legible, feels low-pressure. The structure is straightforwardly linear and works, though it leaves potential escalation and consequence under-explored.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: patch → pattern of numbers → hidden folder → lockout → bypass → final transmission → decision. The story delivers a legible closure beat (her decision to expose the truth) that reconfigures the situation, but the felt price of that choice is mostly implied rather than concretely staged. Structural scope is appropriate for the length, yet obstacles (like the system lockout) are resolved quickly, undercutting the sense of real narrowing options. Strongly functional but not structurally thrilling.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: fragment → mirrors/visions → realization → reconstitution → lighthouse beacon, giving a clear before/after with a Decisive Change and a light Conceptual Repricing. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main setting transition that’s well anchored, and closure is on the page. What limits it is the frictionless progression—no setbacks, resistance, or hard choices complicate the path, so escalation and cost feel modest rather than exigent.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly linear: arrival at the marina, time in the shelter, culminating in the dock epiphany with a clear before/after stance shift. As an accumulative/textural piece, it coheres, but external causality is faint; most beats are reflective, and the man’s question is the only real hinge. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration, yet the price of that shift is soft and largely asserted. Nothing breaks, but the arc feels more like a graceful slide than a sculpted build with sharpened options.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is a single, continuous reflective scene with clear anchors (vineyard, pavilion, night after the last bus) and a stable POV. Under an accumulative/textural lens, details and reflections build toward a conceptual shift about “mismatches” and the space between people, which does land as closure. However, causality is very soft: nothing in the environment truly pressures her beyond providing metaphors, and no concrete option is dramatically foreclosed. The cost of the new stance—accepting permanent loss—is implied but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Elara must consecrate the parapet before the prophet’s arrival; she does, reports success, and receives affirmation. Structure is clean (essentially one throughline with a brief return to the pavilion) and closure is an Earned Stasis/fulfillment moment with a clear before/after in duty completed. However, the piece lacks a strong turn or complication; nothing meaningfully threatens failure or reconfigures options, so the decisive change feels modest. The world-shifting stakes are declared but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a single, clear scene with embedded backstory: arrive, contemplate, arrange photos, conclude for the day. Orientation is strong and the accumulative/textural lens holds, but the causal progression is gentle—there is no real turn that narrows options or forces a new tactic. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration (she leaves with renewed purpose and a reframed view of the ruins), yet the cost is more implied than felt. Some reiteration of her mission (“transmute the pain…,” “testament to the power of collective memory”) flattens the build rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from study to discovery to quiet aftermath, with a clear before/after once the pattern is decoded and the crystal is spent. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—the pattern’s emergence and the crystal’s draining grow directly from his methodical work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his life’s work yields a “seed for the future” at the expense of the tool that enabled it. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, but still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: each movement through the garden (chalk marks, sculptures, driftwood, pond) builds toward the eventual hearing of the sound. Causality is subtle but coherent—his methodical marking and following of intuitions lead him to the pond, where the closure image occurs. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from seeking a future anchoring sound to recognizing he’s generating echoes in the present, with the chalk literally dropped as no longer needed. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the before/after in his stance toward time and memory is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: an inciting disturbance (tremor/clock), investigation, insight (leaf), and a reconfigured ending with the new device. Causality is mostly intact under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—each beat grows out of the last, even if the leaf’s catalytic role leans mystical. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to time and the observatory’s constancy is reframed. The main weakness is the softness of on-page cost; her success comes without a clear trade-off, which keeps the change more conceptual than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara identifies the unfinished business, reaches out to Claire, and this choice leads to the reunion and quiet closure. The single-scene structure is straightforward, with no orientation issues and a legible before/after: Mrs. Bennett alone vs. mother and daughter reconciled. Closure lands as a kind of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, but the path is extremely smooth—Claire’s arrival and willingness are frictionless, reducing a sense of cost or risk. Structurally publishable, but not yet intricate or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is legible and linear: research → workshop/relearning → edge confrontation → discovery and return. Structure (observatory frame with two clear excursions) is clean, and the closure unit—learning where shadows go at noon via the key during an awakening—is on-page. However, the supposed high stakes (“unravel the very fabric of reality,” “next awakening was imminent”) never translate into concrete jeopardy or visible cost, so the decisive event reads more like a smooth procedure than a pressured climax. The drive lens is Causal and holds, but closure’s cost is conceptual only and underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal through-line is clean: tooth → maze → garden → fountain → sacrifice → transformation, with a clear before/after in her stance toward certainty. The closure beat (giving up the childhood stone to gain healing/understanding) lands on the page with a legible cost and reconfiguration. Structure is linear, well-contained in a single arc, and uses its one transition (maze → garden) efficiently. The main limitation is that external stakes (friend’s substitute body, village, changeling) stay abstract and offstage, so escalation reads more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: grotto → polishing → memory interludes → activation of the glass → decision to return to the village. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression from reflection to action to outward-facing resolve provides a modest but coherent closure (a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn). Causality is gentle but intact; nothing strains plausibility or feels teleported. The primary weakness is that the climactic shift—Lira’s readiness to share—is more a confirmation of a long desire than a sharp before/after change with a strong on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a brief, anchored past leads into a single continuous scene with a clear beginning (solitude), middle (Kai’s arrival and tour), and end (shared quiet). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her prior hurt motivates the refuge; Kai’s arrival and notebook concretize the possibility of safe connection; the garden’s atmosphere gathers weight toward the closing image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctuary is redefined as a beginning rather than purely a retreat. The coincidence of Kai’s appearance is a bit convenient but doesn’t break plausibility at this quiet scale.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—mist → first apparition (mother) → series of cameos → glowing shell → tree of shells—builds coherently toward a closure where she commits to writing. Causality is clear under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the shell acting as a subtle key that opens the path and the heart of the nexus. The closure (placing the fragment, beginning to write) is on the page and legible as a decisive stance change, though the price of that decision is more implied than sharply dramatized. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early, and there are no jarring ellipses or rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: workshop setup → ritual attempt → success and transformation into orbs. Causality is intact but very soft—once she decides to hum/sing, everything unfolds without blockage, complication, or trade-off. Closure qualifies as a decisive change (the remedies/stories are restored), but it comes with no discernible price or hard choice. The “when everything aligns” framing suggests a live clock, yet the scene never exploits that pressure structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: gather materials → arrange pattern → apply starlight → seal → observe transformed orchard → depart. Causality is intact and legible, and the tremor plus the plate’s activation function as a mild tightening and closure beat. However, the drive is almost entirely procedural/ritual, with little sense that failure is a live option or that her choices significantly alter available paths. The closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a Decisive Change, and the cost of success is conceptually implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wounded season → need to repair the timer → long study → dusk breakthrough → activation and future plan. Structure is linear and easy to follow with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and closure lands in his decision to begin the “harvest of echoes” with the repaired mechanism. The main weakness is the softness of on-page cost—years of effort and seasonal stakes are told, not concretely tested. The ending offers a before/after but without a strong felt price attached to the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from routine, to intrusion, to an offered choice, to a reoriented practice. Causality is intact—figure appears, questions purpose, offers choice, prompting Elara’s internal turn—and the closure (turning the weaving inward) is legible. The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative: pressure arises from the encounter and deepening reflection rather than external events. The main limitation is that the decisive shift, while conceptually clear, feels somewhat low-friction and low-cost in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene in the loft, framed by the rain and kettle, with the carving arc providing a clear beginning–middle–end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats deepen rather than twist: starting the carving, confronting the mane, completing the lion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reweights her grief through the finished carving—with a legible before/after. The cost is more conceptual than sharply dramatized, but it is present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: find wheel → hear past self → follow hum to fragments → receive clearer message → stance shift. Causality is adequately motivated under an accumulative/textural lens, and orientation (who/where/when) is early and stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to regret/ghost reweights her future choices with a felt cost (ongoing work, no magic fix). The main limitation is the relative safety of the path—no moment where options narrow under acute pressure—so the change feels contemplative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal spine is clear: Eli explores, discovers the sextant fragment, experiments with the terminal’s systems, and emerges with a reconfigured sense of hope. Structure is linear and legible, with a coherent accumulative drive toward resurrecting the space and extracting meaning from it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he leaves with the sextant and an internalized “maze of intentions”—but the path faces almost no resistance, so the before/after shift is conceptually neat rather than dramatically charged. All set-ups (sextant, labyrinthine terminal, engineer skill) do return, but largely in expected ways.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean, single-POV, single-arc structure with clear causal linkage: morning → crystal whispers “bear” → remembered abandonment of travel → decision to complete the clock → final “home.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what it means to live with an abandoned dream, and the sanctuary’s meaning shifts from cage to cradle. The cost—accepting the limits of her chosen life—remains somewhat abstract, with no concrete lost opportunity or irreversible consequence dramatized on the page. Still, the overall structure is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: Elara goes to the canal, follows her instincts, salvages the barge, finds the chest, reads the journal, and gains a reorienting truth. The piece operates under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens and lands a modest Resonant Reconfiguration: the canal and relics move from decay to possibility in her perception. However, the sense of cost at closure is faint—her ache is noted but no concrete option is foreclosed, and future stakes are gestured at rather than dramatized. Structure is clean for a single scene, but the inciting pressure and climax feel low-intensity for the ambitions implied.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: examine rope → sense pattern → align with fulgurite → realize it’s a map/legacy and commit to preserving it. Causality holds and the accumulative, lyric drive is consistent, but the escalation from curiosity to revelation is frictionless. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she understands and accepts the legacy—but the cost of that realization is not dramatized. The stakes remain largely conceptual and never feel truly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → encounter → confession → obituary-writing → exchange of threads → departure, all in one continuous scene with clear orientation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene steadily layers absence, waiting, and witnessing until the obituary and thread exchange reconfigure the woman’s stance toward herself. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the traveler writes an obituary for the waiting self, and the woman’s tears signal a costly letting go. The main limitation is that the stakes and turns remain very gentle; there’s no strong sense of risk or potential failure surrounding this ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: research → map → descent → discovery → assembly → revelation → return with altered understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: Kael’s sense of the egg’s role and the nature of “flawed genesis” is reconfigured with a quiet but legible before/after. However, the cost at the ending is mostly conceptual and lightly sketched—no tangible sacrifice or irreversible choice yet—so the climax feels more like the prologue to a larger tale than a fully self-contained arc. Structure is solid and readable, but not yet strikingly intricate or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: present-tense mission at the lagoon framed by concise backstory and resolved in a reflective close. Causality under an accumulative/lyric lens holds: legacy → decision to graft → ritual → reconfigured self-understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she still bears scars and village judgment), but escalation is minimal and the ritual proceeds without complication, keeping the arc modest rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious delivery → breadcrumbs → deepening city exploration → final shard at the central fountain → activation and release of memories. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early, and the breadcrumb structure gives the piece a clear forward drive. Closure is decisive: the fountains awaken and the city’s “forgotten heart” is restored, reweighting the box from prison to catalyst. The main limitation is that the solution unfolds almost frictionlessly; there’s no meaningful setback or risk of failure to sharpen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Elara enters the garden, engages the gear via sonar pinging, and reaches a resolved understanding. Causality is present but soft—pressure increases as light grows, but there is no real risk of failure or tangible consequence for missteps. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing (she reframes light and connection), yet the cost of that insight is mostly asserted, not dramatized. The accumulative/lyric drive lens holds, though escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: greenhouse → ribbon and backstory → Tomas and his maxim → realization that grief is migration → charged departure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: grief shifts from “shape to carve” to “migration to honor,” and Tomas’s mentorship concludes as she walks away. Causality is soft but coherent; each reflection is plausibly triggered by present objects and leads to the next insight. The main cap is that external stakes and concrete costs remain low, keeping the decisive change primarily intellectual/emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one focal character, a clear setup (routine), disruption (inscriptions and the pendulum’s pause), and a closure beat where his role is redefined. The causal chain is mostly accumulative—observation → reflection → resolved stance—without any real jeopardy or blocked objective, so the “because/therefore” linkages feel soft. The weeks-long town transformation is compressed into summary, which blurs intermediate turns that might otherwise sharpen the arc. Closure does land (a Conceptual Repricing of his duty), but with limited on-page cost and minimal structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: find object → bring to silo → decode tapestry → interpret its meaning, all in a single coherent time/place frame. Closure functions as a quiet conceptual repricing—he now sees his work as a deeper connection to enduring intentions—but the emotional and practical stakes remain modest. The chess clock and “hours passed” gestures don’t materially tighten options, so escalation is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: tasked by the king → hesitation at the blank page → decision to write with the magical quill → the world begins to transform. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after centered on the act of writing, and the closure image (spire glowing, sunlight on the lake) is legible as a Decisive Change. However, the transformation happens very quickly once the quill touches the page, with little resistance or complication, which flattens the arc’s sense of earned difficulty. The world-shift feels more like an automatic payoff than something that tests or strains the protagonist’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: solitary copying → strange radio behavior → pirate song → transcription → final resolve. The piece follows a straightforward single-scene structure with one temporal glide into dawn and delivers a modest but legible closure (a stance crystallization around using the lyrics as a guide). Cost and consequence remain conceptual rather than dramatized, so the ending feels more like an opening of a quest than a decisive reconfiguration. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of stillness → activation → quiet poise holds, but escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from arrival to ritual to reflective closure without confusion, and the causal chain (she promised → she comes → she scatters → she reinterprets) holds. The drive is accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the act of scattering reweights the gallery, mask, and “mirage of safety.” However, the stakes do not meaningfully tighten beyond what’s implied at the opening, so the arc feels more like a sustained mood than a progression. The cost is mostly conceptual and gently rendered, limiting impact at a “prestige venue” level.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine (sewer isolation → repeated visits from Lira → news of collapse → decision to surface and salvage) is clean and easy to follow, with a legible before/after. The weeks-long relationship development is compressed into summary, which flattens some structural tension that could have escalated across scenes. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Kael reframes past vs. future as complementary rather than opposed, but the concrete cost of that shift is only lightly sketched. Still, the situational lens holds: pressure from the collapse forces him to crystallize a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: dwindling choir and cultural indifference → Elara’s decision to “subtract noise” → experimental humming ritual → deepened choir → public performance and conceptual reframing of “vanishing arts.” Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the accumulative/textural drive (rituals, repeated singing) coheres to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Cost is gentle and mostly implied (working against indifference with limited numbers), but the before/after—dead library vs. “living cathedral of sound”—is legible. The lack of a sharp external test or setback keeps the structure from feeling fully pressured, but closure reads complete.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: find seed → choose greenhouse and timing → plant during alignment → focus intention → plant grows → she prunes/cleans → fruit appears → she eats and reorients her mission. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with the celestial alignment providing a mild temporal frame. Closure is present—biting the fruit grants a new, expanded vision of hope and confirms her path—but the cost of that shift is only lightly implied. Still, the drive lens (causal with thematic overtones) holds consistently from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: box → key → staircase → orb → revelation → resolve to reveal, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the blackout and a decisive commitment to speak the truth. However, most turns are convenient (perfectly fitting key, effortless access to the core chamber) and opposition is minimal, so the structure feels more like a guided tour than pressured problem-solving. The cost of the final choice is implied but not dramatized beyond a general sense of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly linear: discover shard → collect displaced objects → sanctify → interpret the result as a new way of reading the world. As an accumulative/textural piece, the progression of images and actions coheres, and the closure unit (his realization of purpose) is legible. That said, the causal stakes are mild, and the change at the end is more a gentle clarification than a decisive turn with strong consequence. The piece is well-shaped but feels more like an evocative vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara finds the garden and ampoule, Liora warns her, she alters course, and weeks later we learn the outcome. The story achieves closure via a conceptual repricing (Liora as guardian of nuance), but the decisive scientific testing and any near-failures are off-page, softening the sense of cost. Structurally, the “weeks later” summary jumps over what should be the core trial of the serum. Still, orientation is clear and the before/after in Liora’s role is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulative scene on the staircase, with backstory woven in, building to the accidental loss of the mentor’s die and the subsequent internal “rupture.” Causality is straightforward—her quest leads her deeper, the staircase tightens, the die is dropped, forcing a revaluation—and the final realization constitutes a clear conceptual repricing of her original goal. Orientation is strong from the opening and the pattern (lyric interior under a strange physical constraint) is taught early and held. The main ceiling is that the global drive remains small-scale and philosophical rather than dramatically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal thread: humming brush → vision → intensified painting → realization → quiet resolution. Structure is a single continuous scene with one magical tilt, easy to orient in and coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara redefines her insomnia and art as a bridge to a buried language and purpose—but the cost of this new charge is only lightly implied, not sharply felt. The arc holds, yet the decisive before/after shift could be sharpened through a more tangible price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: lens discovered → odd phenomena → decision to bake initials with enchanted honey → communal gathering → cultural thaw and renewed tradition. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with a legible before/after and a clear closure where the tradition spreads. However, the lack of obstacles or setbacks makes the progression feel slightly schematic, and the lens’ power is accepted without serious questioning or complication. Closure is present but comes with minimal resistance or ambiguity, limiting structural heft.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → studying stone → applying yoyo logic → activation → altered lighthouse/world, with no major orientation or logic slips. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (time mechanics reversed, island charged) with a conceptual cost (irreversibility, unleashed power he doesn’t understand). That said, the cost is more implied than concretely dramatized—no specific, immediate consequence or narrowed option is shown beyond “no going back.” The drive lens (causal) holds nicely, but escalation remains relatively straightforward without a strong complicating turn.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: post-resuscitation draw to the funhouse → encounter with the advisor → dictionary and clasp as tools → progressive traversal of mirrors/clocks → explicit unbosoming and collapse of the fear-structure. Closure is solidly on the page with a clear before/after: Clara exits lighter, the funhouse fades, and fear’s logic has been reframed. The structure is linear and clean, if somewhat unsurprising, and all major set-ups (advisor, dictionary, clasp, luminance) pay off at least minimally. Cost is present but light, focused on the momentary terror rather than any deeply disruptive consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is linear and clean: he senses dissonance, plays, the clouds respond, he decodes the message, and reaches a calm resolution. As an accumulative/textural piece, the escalation via increasingly intentional notes and cloud response works, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (restlessness → peace, world-as-instrument clarified). However, the cost of this resolution is conceptual rather than felt, and stakes never become more than mildly internal. It’s well-shaped but not structurally daring or particularly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: obsession → whistle at the gate → crack → tunnel → chamber → revelation → new quest. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the structure (surface city → descent → revelation → return with mission) fits the length and stays in one POV. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the problem is not just the rusted gate but the dying turtles and the city’s weight, with a new, concrete goal (find the heart of the first turtle). The main limitation is that obstacles are light—everything important opens fairly easily once she tries, so the decisive moments don’t fully test her.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → clue in ledger → key → archive → revised understanding of noble lies. The story delivers closure via a conceptual repricing, with Elara’s view of noble lies becoming more nuanced at the end. Stakes and obstacles are mostly intellectual; the puzzle is solved without real risk or reversal, which keeps escalation modest. Structure is sound and coherent, but relatively safe for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal line: arrival → discovery of the journal → decision to repair and inscribe → revelation of the mosaic → reframed identity. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with a new self-conception and a charged object (the inkwell) after materially altering the pavilion. Cost is present but modest (exhaustion, emotional weight), and there are no orientation issues. Structure is sound and publishable, though the arc never tightens to a point of true difficulty or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is coherent: blackout → opportunity to explore differently → noticing anomalies → map → stamp as key → revelation of the city’s true origins. Structure is cleanly single-POV and linear, with a clear before/after based on knowledge gained. The library’s sudden, obedient transformations in response to the stamp feel convenient and low-friction, softening the sense of risk or difficulty. Closure is on-page and legible as a conceptual repricing, but the path to it is almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: workshop despair → Lira’s challenge → choice to seek the basilica → encounter with past crane → re-seeing the shadow → revised stance on grief. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: his understanding of the shadow and his craft’s purpose are reweighted with clear before/after. Stakes remain modest and purely internal, but they are legible and carried through without breaks in logic or orientation. The structure (two linked locations, one POV, one arc) is tight and appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain—wedding drone strike → retreat to observatory → study of crystals → reframed purpose—is coherent and easy to follow. Structure is essentially one reflective scene with embedded backstory, closing on a clear realization (a modest Conceptual Repricing) when she recognizes her journey as ongoing rather than a single awakening. Cost at closure is implied more than dramatized; the sense of before/after is present but not deeply tested. Overall, the accumulative pattern is steady if somewhat safe.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drone survey → hidden alcove → first piece → star charts → tower → second piece → vault → third piece → activation and realization. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-POV, single-location structure stays coherent. Closure functions as a modest Resonant Reconfiguration: the assembled chip triggers a conceptual shift about belonging and an ongoing quest. The cost at the end is more implied (he must continue into the unknown) than concretely dramatized, which keeps this below higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal spine—terrace guilt → descent to shore as a chosen method of reckoning → symbolic engagement with carvings and watch → recovered memory → renunciatory climb back—is clear and coherent. Closure lands as a small but decisive internal shift: he forecloses further participation in forgery, with the cost being his complicity now fully owned. The single-scene structure with one transition (terrace to beach to terrace) reads cleanly under a causal/accumulative lens. Stakes remain modestly scaled and purely internal, which keeps the arc contained rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous negotiation scene where Elara presents a proposal, meets resistance, and wins a conditional commitment. Causality is straightforward—her framing with the object and the “neutral territory” concept leads to Kael’s reconsideration—and orientation is solid from the first paragraph. Closure is on-page with a clear before/after: the kingdoms move from stalemate to a new process, with cost implied in Kael’s warning about his reluctance to forgive. The stakes remain mostly declarative rather than materially tested in-scene, limiting the sense of structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from contemplation on the dock to committed motion on the water. Causality is simple but intact—her past failure leads to reliance on poles, which culminates in the present choice to put away the compass. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, with a legible before/after in how she orients herself. The cost and stakes are modest but clear: she relinquishes an old form of control for a more vulnerable, adaptive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: present-tense arrival at the lake, brief backfill on the procedure and journey, then the causal chain of dropping the ball → following it → realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he abandons the fantasy of a “clean slate” and commits to bearing empathy with his past intact. Causality is straightforward and the single scene window is well-contained. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, but they are coherent and culminate without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: fortune → scent → guardian → conjuring → realization, and the story delivers a legible before/after through Elara’s changed understanding of the “bond.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the felt cost of that shift is light; nothing on the page truly tests or threatens her goal beyond redefinition. Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation or lens issues, but escalation is modest and conflict never truly tightens options. The phoenix/world-reset premise functions more as frame than as an active structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: childhood object → crack-as-map → cards → vision → decision to return, with no major orientation issues. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with one clear escalation and a decisive reconfiguration at the end. Closure is strong: the saucer’s meaning is reweighted and her future behavior is concretely reframed. The main limitation is that the pressure curve is fairly gentle, without major complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → approach → use of Kwan Yin’s Tear → portal opens → stitching completes the awakening, giving a legible before/after. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one main transition (ship to new dimension) and a clear closure beat. However, the process of unlocking the dimension faces little resistance—once she decides, it mostly works on the first attempt—so the promise of a “locked” portal and arduous shadow work feels under-tested on the page. Closure functions, but with relatively low felt cost for the massive declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: beach → detour → cove → release, with a clear throughline under an accumulative/lyric lens. Causality is intact (the hush prompts the detour which leads to the archway and revelation), and the closure unit—releasing the lightning bugs with an accompanying realization—lands on the page. The cost (giving up her most cherished object, shifting from observer to “the prophecy itself”) is present but underplayed, so the before/after divide is more conceptual than felt. Overall, it’s solidly shaped but not yet transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → sundial puzzle → hidden key → confrontation with Thorne → activation of the cradle. Orientation is solid from the opening and the piece maintains a single, coherent scene. The main weakness is how effortlessly the critical beats resolve—the cipher yields immediately, the hidden panel accepts the key without complication, and Thorne offers only token resistance—so escalation feels somewhat under-tested. Closure still lands as a decisive on-page change with clear before/after, even if the price is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: vision/promise → years of pursuit → precise ritual with rocks → activation via star dust → comprehension and reconfigured understanding. The piece functions under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with the ritual’s completion triggering a Conceptual Repricing of the world’s patterns. Closure is solid: Kael’s options and knowledge are clearly “before/after,” and the new shifting pattern extends the drive into the future. The main limitation is that cost is mostly pre-paid in backstory (“haunted him for years”) rather than materially tested or sharpened during the on-page climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: envelope arrival → hesitation with timer/storm → map reveal → clarified purpose and new decision to write. The causal chain is coherent and easy to follow, and the piece satisfies closure through a conceptual reconfiguration where Elara redefines their role and future trajectory. However, the price of this shift is mostly implied; there’s little concrete sense of what returning to that past/self will cost beyond abstract fear and regret. As an accumulative, lyric design it holds together well but stops short of a truly cutting final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is clean: one contained scene, clear objective (interpret the challenge/overture), and a tidy conceptual closure where the premise is re-framed. Causality follows a simple “argument → counterargument → synthesis” arc without breaks, but the pressure remains low and highly abstract. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“the overture is us/questions”), yet there’s little sense of what possibility is truly foreclosed or what is lost. Overall it feels more like a philosophical vignette than a story with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clear and linear: Elias finds the library, meets Clara, they discover the letters, rebuild the space, and end on the rooftop with a renewed stance, which yields a resonant reconfiguration closure. Causality basically holds—each beat flows logically, and the coffee tin/letters motif feeds back into the final writing moment. However, the drive lens is largely accumulative/textural; there’s no strong tightening of options or on-page cost, so the before/after divide feels gentle rather than decisive. The war letters and prison-library context hint at larger stakes but aren’t fully cashed out in concrete pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor of the reel → decision to seek it → journey guided by compasses → projection → immersion → return with altered stance, and the closure (new way of playing) lands as an earned reconfiguration. The structure is straightforward and legible, with one main tightening when she chooses to leave the bench and follow the compasses. The main limitation is how frictionless the quest and film experience feel, with little resistance or complication before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: looming monsoon → decaying memory → quest for seed → confrontation with guardian → planting → monsoon test. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Closure is present but low-cost: the seed is found where the dream said, the guardian poses a single question, and success leads directly to safety with no meaningful setback or sacrifice. The piece reads more like a polished outline of a fable than a fully pressured narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: arrival → discovery of objects → following the compass → letters and tide ritual → realization and return. Causality is sound under an accumulative/textural lens; each step grows naturally from the last, and the closure (conceptual repricing of what he’s seeking) lands on the page. The cost—choosing to release regret and leave the objects—is present but could be shaded with a slightly keener sense of what he’s losing. Orientation is strong from the start; no structural confusion.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.2)
    The structure collapses into a summary montage ("days turned into weeks") that dissipates the scene's immediate tension. The resolution is unearned, relying on magical convenience where the dust simply "decodes" intentions without causal setbacks or a visible cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is broken by magical convenience; the frost patterns mirroring the ledger strip lacks logical grounding even within the fantasy context. Closure is a summary of future intent ("renewed determination") rather than a dramatized scene with a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina: Elara fails to find a pattern until Kael enters and hands her the solution ("I think I've found something"). The closure—a sudden realization of beauty in silence—arrives without a visible or felt cost; the epiphany is granted rather than earned through sacrifice or ingenuity. The inciting incident is backstory, leaving the present scene without immediate causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a mechanical video-game logic: receive quest, find book, collect fragments, win. The "impossible spaces" serve as convenient containers for plot coupons rather than causal obstacles, and the resolution is a "soft reset" that erases the protagonist's burden without a felt price. The causality is weak, relying on the convenient proximity of all necessary components within one room.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("weathered many storms," "Word spread quickly") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope defaults for short fiction. The timeline is compressed, reducing potential tension to a synopsis of events. Closure is weak; the resolution (unity/volunteering) arrives without a "felt or conceptual cost" or a decisive turning point where failure was possible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot relies on "video game logic" (breathe to reveal item, insert item in slot) and convenience rather than earned causality. The resolution serves as a "soft reset" where magical intervention resolves the central conflict instantly without cost or sacrifice. The backstory dream is used to forcefully bypass the need for organic motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (find item, place item, win) lacking causal friction. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the central loss (fading memories) is fixed by a magic object without requiring a price or sacrifice, failing the closure cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.7)
    The central puzzle (arrow and piano) is pre-solved in backstory ("discovered this connection months ago"), reducing the present action to rote execution without discovery or risk. The ending relies on a *Deus Ex Machina* where the chains vanish without cause ("as if they had never been there"), breaking physical causality to force a happy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest (arrive, collect, forge, realize) that relies on magical logic. While coherent, the causality is loose—the "absence" and "sound" function as metaphors made literal without mechanical friction. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing, but the ease of execution reduces its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks genuine causal tension; the antagonist yields the prize immediately after a low-stakes gesture, removing all resistance. Closure is unearned, as the protagonist acquires the goal without paying a visible or felt cost, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    The structure is a static meditation with weak causality; the closure (sealing the bookmark) is a symbolic gesture that feels distinct from any prior accumulation of pressure. The narrative explains the shift rather than earning it through scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central action; the decoding of the notes ("Hours passed... slowly a pattern emerged") skips the causal chain entirely. The resolution is a Deus Ex Machina where a magical voice explains the theme and solves the plot, resulting in zero earned cost. The discovery of the key inside the cast *after* hours of decoding feels convenient and chronologically disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a static vignette organized as a list of three summarized stories, lacking a causal chain or a meaningful turn. The ending offers no decisive change or reconfigured stakes, merely a continuation of the initial state, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "second chance program" acts as a deus ex machina introduced via a mid-story exposition dump, breaking causality and immersion. The closure lacks a felt cost; the protagonist simply plays the instrument and receives the answer, rendering the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution; the conflict evaporates the moment the gesture is made, lacking earned causality or resistance. The link between the cracked lens/doodles and the thawing of deep mistrust is purely metaphorical, not causal. Orientation is adequate, but the drive is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative shifts into summary mode ("As days turned into weeks") to bypass scene work, violating the single-scene/shard focus required for immediate publishability. The "measurable luck" premise is introduced in the second paragraph but immediately abandoned, creating a significant causality break (Orphaned Element). Closure is a low-stakes epiphany with no prior complication.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a generic "break it, fix it" arc with a "soft reset" ending that erases consequences. The resolution relies on a convenient memory of a mentor's platitude rather than a costly choice, and the station reboots perfectly, failing the requirement for a decisive change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on convenience and magical logic ("water damage... creating images") rather than causal progression. Closure is a symmetric "gift" from the ghost with no visible cost or sacrifice paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative arc, centering on Elara's internal processing of the "swallowed truth." While the structure is competent, the "truth" acts as a vague MacGuffin; because its nature is never concretized, the stakes remain theoretical. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (accepting the process over the form), but the lack of specific cost or consequence softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=2.8)
    Closure relies on a "magic button" solution (turning the wheel instantly fixes the ghosts) with zero felt or conceptual cost, violating the high-end requirement for consequence. Causality breaks when Mara possesses unearned knowledge about the wheel's specific supernatural function. The narrative follows a video-game logic (find key, insert key, win) that lacks literary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "dream/vision" reset where the physical destination vanishes, erasing the consequences of the journey. The resolution—journals magically filling with entries Lira didn't write—is a deus ex machina that solves the central conflict without earned labor or cost, severing the causal link between the protagonist's struggle and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.4)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where a literal magical event (glowing hair) resolves the conflict instantly without cost or logical groundwork. The causality is broken by the inconsistency between the theme ("ordinary magic") and the event (supernatural glowing), leaving the ending unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, convenience-driven path (finding diaries off-screen, discovering scrolls easily) to an unearned "win state" closure where a magical ritual instantly fixes the global problem without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative relies on synopsis-style summary rather than dramatized scenes. Causality is broken by "magic object" logic where spy specs somehow enable the decoding of dreams and the orchestration of fate without a mechanism. The closure—a decision to leave—feels unearned because there was no on-page resistance or cost to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on abstract assertion rather than causal mechanics; the resolution is a *deus ex machina* where a thematic declaration dissolves the antagonist without logical friction or cost. The plot lacks a legible turning point driven by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structure is a linear progression of a ritual task without significant complication or causal pressure. While the scene completes its arc (writing leads to playing), the closure is a spectacle of light and sound rather than a decisive change in stance or circumstance. The "exhaustion" acts as a declared plot device rather than a structural cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is a linear "tour" of visions with no causal friction or active decision-making; the protagonist simply walks and observes until the end. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset"—a sudden realization that dissolves the conflict without any visible or felt cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the problem is reframed as a gift, lacking the requisite trade-off for high-band literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on a summary bridge ("Hours turned to days") that violates the short-story scope of a continuous scene or mosaic shards. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the central problem vanishes via a magical mechanism without a causal decision or paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.4)
    Plot progression depends on convenience; the protagonist bypasses armed guards by simply "intuiting" their patterns, a skill not established or earned. The climax is resolved through an explanatory monologue by a helpful stranger rather than a decisive, cost-laden action by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is functional and linear, with a clear inciting incident and closure. However, the "days turned into weeks" transition dissipates immediate tension, and the climax relies on a passive observation of visions rather than an active engagement with the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.7)
    The structure is a linear progression of events with low causal pressure and minimal resistance. The closure lands on a symbolic action (leaving the rope), but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: arrival, discovery, action, success. There is no meaningful reversal or deepening of the situation; the "chronic hush" yields immediately to the music without escalating pressure. The closure relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by the protagonist's primary skill without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural vignette with no deviation, resistance, or cost; the protagonist performs a task perfectly and leaves. The closure is a "soft reset" (job done, satisfaction felt) that lacks the required Decisive Change or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative spans weeks via summary ("Days turned into weeks") rather than dramatizing a specific high-pressure scene, violating the short-story scope defaults. The inciting incident is a convenient contrivance (the man simply handing over the letter), and the ending is a frictionless "happy ever after" that lacks the required Decisive Change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary ("Weeks turned into months"), violating the short-story scope and dissipating tension. The resolution—a mirror-encounter realizing she found herself—lacks causal grounding or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing driven by a magical prop rather than causal choices. The ending is a "soft reset" where the protagonist's problem is solved by dipping a hand in water, lacking the required felt cost or decisive change in tactics. The closure feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on summary ("spent the next several nights") to bypass the actual work of decoding, destroying scene tension. Causality is convenient and linear—finding the eyes leads instantly to the solution without trial, error, or cost—and the "happy" ending resolves the complex premise of ambiguous loss with unearned ease.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality breaks significantly when the tape fragments play audio ("hummed to life") without a playback device, resolving the plot through magical convenience rather than established mechanism. The closure depends on this logic gap and a sentimental realization that feels unearned by the prior low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a magical catalyst (the dissolving leaf) to induce a shift, acting as a convenience that bypasses the need for genuine causal progression. The climax—rearranging pots—lacks a visible or felt cost; the protagonist changes her entire worldview without facing a concrete trade-off or irrevocable consequence. Closure is achieved through assertion of a new state rather than a dramatized decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest driven by convenience (rain trails leading to the goal) and summary (deciphering the map off-screen). The central "exchange" lacks causal friction or a felt cost, resulting in a low-tension transaction rather than a dramatic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, lacking causal density or distinct beats. The arc is linear and frictionless; the protagonist arrives, touches an object, and is instantly enlightened, bypassing the necessary escalation and cost required for a publishable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on a low-pressure linear sequence: find object, use object, receive explanation. The climax depends on a deus ex machina (the woman in gray) to provide meaning, bypassing the need for the protagonist to earn the resolution through causality or struggle. Closure is a soft realization without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot proceeds linearly through convenience; arrows appear to guide the protagonist, and doors open simply because she approaches. The closure is a soft reset where the "cost" is abstract ("leaving behind safety") rather than felt or demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot is strictly linear and lacks tension; events occur because magical prompts (dreams, glowing, pulls) dictate them, not because of causal character agency. The resolution provides symmetric satisfaction without requiring the protagonist to overcome a genuine obstacle or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a mechanical "and then" progression driven by abstract magic rather than causal necessity. The climax—a "blinding flash of light"—resolves the tension through spectacle rather than protagonist agency or logical consequence. Closure lacks a legible cost; the protagonist gains a "new chapter" without sacrificing anything tangible or conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.7)
    The story relies on a deus ex machina (the magic ink pot) to bridge the central conflict, breaking causal logic. Closure fails the cost requirement; the antagonist's immediate capitulation ("Sense is overrated") functions as a soft reset, resolving a lifelong dynamic without a visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure where success is inevitable, lacking a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" born from struggle. The ending relies on a gift economy—the forest provides the story freely—rather than a causal chain where the protagonist pays a "visible or felt cost" to achieve her goal. The closure feels unearned because the inciting incident (the stronger hum) resolves immediately into success without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on summary ("weeks ago") and coincidence ("stumbled upon") rather than causal agency to advance the plot. Closure is achieved through a low-cost thematic assertion that summarizes the premise rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing where magical effects (glowing shell, tilting room) replace causal agency. The closure is a "soft reset" that resolves the quest via a platitude ("riddle isn't to be solved") without requiring the protagonist to use her established skills or pay a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on broad summary and montage ("As Lira delved deeper," "The turning point came") rather than a continuous, causal scene. The resolution is convenient and unearned, achieved by a collective epiphany rather than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot is functional and linear but relies on the convenient arrival of the chemical message to drive the inciting incident. The closure is tidy, lacking a felt cost; ignoring mission control has no on-page consequence, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear vignette of a successful repair with no obstacles, setbacks, or causal turns. The ending is a "Symmetric Satisfaction" failure: the problem introduced (broken drone) is solved instantly without cost or complication. The ship’s departure is parallel ambiance, not a clock that pressures the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path without meaningful obstacles or reversals; the resolution relies on a convenient coincidence (condensation matching the river) rather than problem-solving. Closure is achieved through a "gift" from the environment, lacking earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Days turned into weeks") rather than dramatizing a specific scene with real-time pressure, violating the scope default for short fiction. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the town is restored without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina resolution where "shifting walls" conveniently solve the physical entrapment without cost or logical setup. Causality breaks down when the protagonist, trapped in the deep ocean, simply makes a "journey back to the surface" without addressing decompression or the initial cave-in. The ending offers a soft reset rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot hinges on a "journal ex machina" that explains the mystery and mechanics in a single exposition dump. The climax (hovering away) lacks causal grounding; the protagonist gains a magical ability simply by choosing "truth," bypassing the established physical constraints of the prison.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" progression driven by the convenient arrival of supernatural elements (the voices) rather than genuine causal pressure. The climax—a realization of "collective debt"—arrives abruptly as a Deus Ex Machina to force resolution, lacking adequate setup or earned stakes in the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative structure is strictly linear and lacks a legible cost or decisive change; the ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the goal is achieved exactly as intended. The "sleepwalking" method contradicts the deliberate agency shown in scene ("paused," "looked"), creating causal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.6)
    Plot progresses through summary ("days turned into weeks") and convenience (roots guiding the protagonist, key fitting perfectly) rather than earned causality. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" moment with no visible cost or trade-off, resolving tension too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest without resistance; the protagonist decodes clues and retrieves the object without obstacle. Causality is soft—she succeeds because her "nature allowed her to," not through tactical ingenuity. Closure fails the cost requirement; the ending is a summary of success and a smile, offering no decisive change or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks a functional crisis or rising action; the conflict is introduced via exposition and resolved instantly by a "magic button" (synchronization). There is no causal struggle or legible cost to the resolution, resulting in a flat, unearned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality is replaced by convenience; roots shift to guide the protagonist and maps appear simply because she closes her eyes. The ending relies on a "magic fix" where reading a letter instantly resolves deep trauma. Closure is absent; there is no decisive change in tactics or world-state, only a declared emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist faces no obstacles in the central task. A significant logic break occurs when the protagonist uses "deft" fingers despite a wrist numbed by anesthetic, disrupting physical credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience and lack of obstruction; the fog literally guides her, and she coincidentally possesses the exact obscure knowledge needed to operate the machinery. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gets exactly what she wants on the first try with no cost or complication. The time-skip ("Hours passed, or perhaps only moments") dissolves potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where events occur sequentially via magical convenience rather than causal pressure. The closure—a realization that certainty was a "cage"—lacks a felt or conceptual cost, reading as a "gift" ending that resolves the premise without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative functions more as a prologue than a story, relying on a convenient "it was a test" trope to resolve the central tension without consequence. The climax dissolves into an alliance too easily, lacking a decisive change earned by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Hours turned into days") rather than dramatized scenes, destroying causal tension. The resolution is inevitable and frictionless ("It was hers, and it worked"), lacking the decisive change and paid cost required for effective literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no distinct obstacles or reversals. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction" where magic resolves the central issue without exacting a meaningful cost; the breaking of the chime is framed as "peace" rather than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure lacks a genuine test or cost; the conflict is resolved by a magical object that functions as a "soft reset," fixing the broken relationship instantly. The "interconnected promises" are internal vows rather than actions with consequences, leading to an unearned "happy ending" where the problem simply evaporates. The resolution relies on a deus ex machina (the magic inkwell/Kael's sudden appearance) rather than protagonist ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative suffers from a lack of causal logic, particularly the "adhesive analysis" performed inside a volcano which breaks suspension of disbelief. The resolution is an unearned "symmetric satisfaction" where a single sketch instantly resolves a deep cultural conflict without trade-offs or cost. The ending is tidy and convenient, lacking the required friction for a literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.2)
    The structure dissolves into a synopsis-style montage ("Over the following weeks") rather than a concrete scene, violating the scope requirements for immediate tension. The central conflict is resolved by a Deus Ex Machina (the anonymous letter) that creates a convenient, cost-free path to closure, lacking any causal pressure or earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure, but the middle lacks causal density; the terrace essentially solves the problem for her by magically triggering a memory. The mention of "the butterfly effect" is a confusing world-building element that is never contextualized, creating orientation debt. While leaving the logbook creates a legible closure action, the buildup is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is driven by convenience; the alarms function as a deus ex machina to force movement after a static observational scene. Severe logic breaks undermine the premise: "cracked" glass domes deep underwater would result in immediate implosion, not a slow leak, shattering the story's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a low-stakes "try/fail/try/succeed" loop where the resolution hinges on a vague, costless pivot ("focused... on the emotion"). The closure is a "soft reset" or "symmetric satisfaction" where the memory vanishes again, yet the protagonist is arbitrarily satisfied without a Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory with no meaningful tightening or reversal. The climax relies on a coincidence (starlight alignment) rather than protagonist agency or earned causality. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" resolution where everything goes perfectly, lacking the required closure cost or reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution relies on a causal break; the sentinel retreats simply because Lira shows the verse, dissolving the established threat of erasure without a logical mechanism or price paid. This soft reset undermines the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks a causal drive lens; it is a sequence of rituals followed by a decision made in a vacuum without obstacle. The ending is a "promise of future action" (he *would* share his reckonings) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. The "shift" mentioned is a declared stake that never manifests to test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks causal progression; the box functions as a magical device ("cracks widening") to trigger realization without protagonist agency. The closure—leaving the box—is a low-cost symbolic gesture that does not result from a decisive change in tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive lens; events unfold as a sequence of static observations rather than a because/therefore chain. The "epiphany" at the end is unearned by prior pressure or action, reading as a "soft reset" where the conflict (the tide) dissolves without consequence. The mention of "parallel timelines" creates orientation debt without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is complete but relies heavily on convenience and video-game logic. The pivotal moment—the film strip slipping from her pocket and revealing a hidden map due to lighting—is a coincidence that removes protagonist agency. The closure is legible (accepting the role), but the "key" mechanism bypasses the intellectual or physical struggle implied by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path: attempt, resistance, increased effort, success. While the orientation is clear, the closure relies on a magical mechanism ("mirrors surrendered") that resolves the conflict without a logical tactical shift or earned conceptual cost. The "borrowed heartbeat" cost is stated but not dramatized via consequences in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Hours turned into days") to skip the actual conflict and negotiation. The resolution is a classic "soft reset" where a single sentimental speech instantly resolves a generational war, lacking causal credibility or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on weak causality where a scientific mission ("genetic material," "science and luck") resolves via a magical coincidence (rain falling immediately upon burial). The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than earned change, and the stakes of the "manufactured drought" are resolved by a ritualistic gesture without logical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no meaningful obstacles or reversals; the central problem is solved by "intuition she couldn't explain," a Deus Ex Machina that bypasses earned causality. There is no visible cost paid for the success, despite the narrator's claims of a "reckoning."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" structure where a sudden epiphany ("Suddenly, an idea sparked") resolves the conflict without causal setup or cost. The inciting incident (the argument) is backstory, and the climax is a purely internal shift in perspective that lacks dramatized resistance. Closure is achieved through a convenient change of mind rather than a decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc without a drive lens; events happen because the author wills them, not because of causal linkage or accumulative pressure. Closure is a "soft reset"—the work is done, and she leaves—lacking the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or legible cost. The ending relies on a symmetric satisfaction that resolves nothing because nothing was at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success without causal resistance or complication; the environment actively assists ("sky itself were cheering"), removing tension. Closure fails the cost requirement: the resolution is a symmetric satisfaction where the goal is achieved perfectly with no trade-off, sacrifice, or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks genuine causality; the climax is a Deus Ex Machina where the object simply "reveals its final secret" without protagonist agency. The ending is a "soft reset" that offers an answer without exacting a visible or felt cost from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on extreme convenience, such as the protagonist simply "brushing against" the hidden tile, and lacks a decisive change with felt cost. The progression is linear and resistant-free.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B path where obstacles are removed by magical ability rather than character agency or sacrifice. The resolution relies on a "magic wand" moment (cellular memory) that bypasses genuine struggle, resulting in a closure that lacks felt cost or causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot follows a linear "problem-solution-reward" path with no meaningful setbacks, relying on convenient magic ("synchronized breathing") that bypasses struggle. The closure offers a "have it both ways" fantasy—grounded heart, soaring spirit—without the visible or felt cost required by the rubric. It reads as a symmetric satisfaction ending that resolves all tension mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative lacks causal friction; the protagonist resolves her spiritual crisis by applying convenient magical items (compass, petals) that work perfectly on the first try. The absence of failed attempts, complications, or a taught logic for the magic makes the closure feel unearned and the "breach" abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "wander and wonder" structure that lacks causal drive or meaningful obstacles. The resolution relies entirely on a deus ex machina (the mysterious woman) appearing to explain the plot's central mystery, triggering the "explain-everything ending" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure that dissolves into summary at the crucial climax. The pivotal confrontation with the guardian—a renegotiation—is narrated in a single sentence ("With the deal struck") rather than dramatized, robbing the story of its peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative structure relies entirely on "magical GPS" logic where an object (the card) literally guides the protagonist from point A to point B without requiring deduction or risk. The plot lacks causal friction; the protagonist encounters no obstacles that require ingenuity to overcome. Closure is achieved through a "magic door" device that resolves the quest by simply appearing, bypassing earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" progression with no causal resistance or setbacks; the puzzle is solved the moment it is engaged. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist gains everything (understanding, artifacts) without any felt or conceptual cost. The causality is video-game logic: matching symbols instantly activates a magical mechanism without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: Lira enters, follows a map, and resolves the crisis with a single magic action ("conjure") that works instantly. The "energy beings" are mentioned as a threat but never create an active obstacle or force a deviation in tactics. The ending is a "soft reset" that restores the status quo without exacting a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story functions with a clear Causal drive, moving from a physical task to a ritual sacrifice with a legible Decisive Change and paid cost. However, the logic connecting the hard labor of "tracking star paths" to the thematic conclusion of "coincidence" is tenuous and feels forced at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative traces a linear path to a "soft reset" ending where the status quo is restored ("memory was safe") without any decisive change or paid price. The inciting incident (solid fog) leads to immediate, unobstructed success, creating an outline-like feel devoid of causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear "arrival-fix-departure" vignette that lacks causal pressure, obstacles, or a decisive turning point. The resolution is unearned—despair vanishes due to spectacle rather than agency—and fails the closure requirement for a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a static scene with weak causality; the protagonist sits, receives a magical vision that solves her intellectual problem, and leaves. The "epiphany" functions as a Deus Ex Machina, resolving the conflict with Kael via a "soft reset" where no on-page price is paid. Orientation is stable, but narrative drive is nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the "gravity inversion" serves as a convenient device rather than a pressure cooker. The climax relies on a vague internal realization ("felt like a hug") rather than a decisive action, and the return is summarized without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative lacks a decisive change with felt cost; the conflict is resolved by the environment rather than protagonist agency. The "soft reset" ending dissolves the problem conveniently, failing the closure requirement for a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear video-game logic (find clue, unlock door, claim prize) without unexpected causal turns. The closure fails the cost requirement; the realization is an abstract reward ("fulfillment") rather than a paid price, and the "sally" sequence breaks physical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line with a legible closure unit (Decisive Change: scar sacrificed, threshold sealed). However, the resolution relies heavily on a convenient magical object ("doorknocker ring") whose mechanics are explained immediately before use, reducing tension. The plot moves predictably from threat to magical counter-measure without a complicating middle beat that tests Lira’s agency beyond the willingness to pay the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear fetch quest lacking causal density or obstacles; Elara receives instructions, obeys them, and succeeds without complication. The closure is unearned because there is no struggle or cost; the "machine" simply fixes her life because she inserted a bolt, resulting in a "and then" sequence rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a "vending machine" structure: the protagonist inserts an object (crank) and immediately receives a full expository dump (the journal) without struggle. The appearance of a figure who simply hands over the answer is a deus ex machina that bypasses necessary investigation or cost. Causality is mechanical, lacking the "because/therefore" friction required for a literary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on convenient magical coincidence (vines acting as instructions) rather than causal linkage. Closure is a soft reset of identity (becoming a storyteller) without a sufficient paid cost or logical setup for that specific outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is driven by extreme coincidence (matching ribbon/letter found immediately next to the button) and the inexplicable "tiny footprints" logic. Closure is a soft reset ("heart lighter") with zero visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot relies on "and then" sequencing with weak causality; the "puddle map" logic is incoherent, and the key fitting a submerged door is a convenient contrivance. The ending resolves the central problem instantly with a broadcast, a "soft reset" that lacks earned cost or complication. The narrative arc is predictable and lacks genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear "and-then" sequence with no resistance; the protagonist arrives, plays, and succeeds immediately. The ending is a "soft reset" where the threat vanishes completely, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a Decisive Change with felt cost. The lack of genuine obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative dissolves into synopsis ("days turned into weeks") exactly when the rising action should tighten, destroying scene tension and causal density. The ending is a stated realization rather than a dramatized closure unit, and the pacing is flat due to the lack of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear video-game logic (stranger drops item, item leads to map, map gives wisdom) lacking genuine causality or pressure. The closure creates symmetric satisfaction—he gains a treasure without paying a price—and relies on an "explain-everything" realization that deflates the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the climax relies on a passive vision sequence within the furnace rather than an active, high-stakes decision. The closure arrives via summary and explanation ("Elara understood now") rather than a dramatic event with visible cost, rendering the "redemption" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist encounters an obstacle (the figure's grief) and immediately resolves it with a single action (playing the harp). The closure is unearned because there is no "try/fail" cycle or deepening of the dilemma—the solution functions as a magic wand that bypasses narrative struggle. The "because/therefore" chain is weak, resembling a checklist of events rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks causal tension; the protagonist wakes, walks, and has an epiphany without encountering resistance or making difficult choices. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the forest magically provides an answer, removing agency from the character. The closure feels unearned because the "mathematics" premise is discarded for a platitude without a visible struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure (finds map, goes to tower, solves puzzle) with zero obstacles or setbacks. The closure is a classic "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the goal is achieved perfectly without an on-page cost or complication, rendering the victory unearned. The "convenient amnesia" of any real resistance turns the plot into a procedural outline.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative suffers from extreme convenience and a lack of causality; the protagonist finds the key object immediately, receives explicit instructions from ghosts, and faces no obstacles. The solution (a clock inside a ceiling void) operates on dream logic without establishing the ground rules, and the resolution arrives without cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a lack of consequence: Elara jumps and is immediately safely caught, removing all tension from the central action. The ending ("The story was just beginning") is a false close that defers resolution and cost, resulting in a "soft reset" rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene; the heist proceeds without on-page obstacles or complications. Causality is linear but lacks the friction of a "try/fail" cycle, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a massive mid-story summary ("The journey... took him through forests") that breaks the scene window and dissipates tension. The story reads like a synopsis of a longer fable rather than a dramatized short story, resulting in a low-stakes, mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a "tourist" structure where the protagonist arrives, observes, and leaves without facing genuine obstacles or opposition. The climax hinges on an accidental loss (the compass slipping) followed by a rationalized acceptance, lacking a decisive active choice or earned cost. The progression is linear and lacks the causal density required for high-stakes engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot is driven by convenience and cliché (GPS failure, intuition) rather than causality. The narrative arc lacks a true crisis; the storm stops exactly when needed, and the resolution involves a mechanical interaction (inserting the slide) with no felt cost or sacrifice to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure violates the short-story scope by summarizing a months-long timeline (autumn to spring) rather than dramatizing a cohesive scene. The ending is a low-cost realization that resolves the premise through abstract assertion rather than causal action. The "montage" mode dissolves all narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but functions as a prologue rather than a complete story; the ending promises future action rather than delivering a decisive change or cost. The "wait and see" structure lacks causal density, relying on a passive vigil that resolves too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot is a linear progression without resistance or causality; the protagonist imagines a result, and it occurs instantly. The "timeframe" and "last wish" elements appear ex machina at the closure, confusing the established logic of the alchemy/bottle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot is a frictionless linear sequence: find object, play object, solve puzzle. Causality relies on the convenient arrival of the shaving and a specific memory; the "soft reset" ending lacks narrative cost or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a convenient "lock and key" structure where the protagonist faces no resistance or complications. The ending acts as a soft reset, resolving the conflict by transitioning to a paradise state without a visible or felt cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality is linear and low-pressure, leading to a "gift" ending where the protagonist solves the problem by simply pulling a rope without facing any cost or trade-off. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction rather than earned closure, as the "zero hour" brings harmony with convenient ease.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is linear and lacks causality driven by the protagonist; events happen *to* Lira (lantern glows, tracking devices activate on their own). The closure is a soft reset where she simply returns to work with a new mindset, lacking a Decisive Change with visible cost. The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" ending that summarizes the character's growth rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.4)
    Plot progression relies on narrative convenience ("contextual clues") and lacks obstacles; the ending is a "soft reset" that instantly fixes the wasteland without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Days turned into weeks") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the short story scope/default track. The resolution is a "soft reset" where a device instantly fixes the problem without requiring a sacrifice, difficult choice, or structural cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot follows a linear "healing fable" template with zero causal friction; the conflict is resolved instantly by a magical prop and immediate cooperation. Closure is unearned, offering a "happy ending" without the requisite sacrifice or struggle to make the change credible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative spans six months via summary ("Days turned into weeks") rather than grounding the reader in a specific scene with immediate stakes. The causality is frictionless; intentions translate instantly into successful actions without the obstruction or cost required for a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path (ascent, encounter, summit) but lacks causal turns or obstacles that force a change in approach. The closure relies on a "realization" ending that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance or trade-offs during the climb. The drive lens is weak; the story moves forward by itinerary rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a ritual with no resistance or complication; the intent (plant seeds) leads directly to the result (blooming) without obstacle. Closure is purely symmetric satisfaction, lacking the required cost or reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causality and cost; the "riddle" is resolved by the standard operation of a machine, offering no resistance or puzzle to solve. The ending relies on a "soft reset" realization that feels unearned by the preceding action. The connection between the wax leaf and the cylinder is vague, relying on magical coincidence rather than mechanical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence of reflection without causal pressure or necessary action. While the closure (a realization of purpose) is legible, it arrives via a convenient epiphany ("it was as if the universe itself was guiding her") rather than earned causality or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a linear, mechanical quest structure without meaningful causal pressure. The climax relies on a convenient interpretation of chess rules ("swapping" pieces) and a "key not a tool" twist that fails to alter the stakes or outcome. No visible cost is paid for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where a mentor figure appears solely to resolve the protagonist's internal state. Causality is weak; the "walking spells words" mechanism resolves the theme magically rather than through character action. Closure is a cost-free epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure where a magical object conveniently resolves the central conflict without cost. The inciting incident (finding the stone) leads immediately to a solution (feather memory) with no meaningful obstacles or failures in between. Closure is an unearned "happy ending" where the protagonist is instantly healed of deep trauma by magic.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.2)
    The central obstacle—decoding the tapestry—is overcome via summary ("Hours passed"), bypassing the necessary dramatization of struggle. The ending is a "soft reset" where an external object delivers a therapeutic epiphany with no visible cost or sacrifice paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the causality is soft; the climax relies on a "magic fix" where the spire enacts the change rather than the protagonist's agency. The resolution ("unburdened") feels unearned because the cost ("a shard of her heart") is stated abstractly rather than dramatized as a felt loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.0)
    Closure relies on a "soft reset" where a thematic declaration ("We are all broken") inexplicably halts the physical collapse of the workshop. This causality break undermines the established physical stakes (acid sea, gears).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the inciting incident (a fallen boulder) is a convenient plot device rather than a pressure point. Closure provides symmetric satisfaction without a felt cost; the protagonist overcomes her defining trauma simply by completing a painting, lacking genuine causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot relies on dream logic and magical guidance (the humming cork, the scent) to move the character from point A to B without causal resistance. The closure is unearned; the resolution comes in the form of a lecture from a mysterious figure that validates the protagonist's worldview without requiring a sacrifice or a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Word spread," "moon waxed") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default. There is no concrete "now" moment or decisive change; the plot advances through synopsis rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure: find cursed object, seek expert, perform ritual, status quo restored. The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where magic creates a convenient fix without exacting a visible, felt cost from the protagonist. The ending provides closure but lacks the requisite structural deepening or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot pivots on a "teleporting prop" convenience: the journal appears exactly where the figure vanished to explain the mystery. The ending is an "explain-everything" resolution where the journal entries explicitly state the backstory and theme, dissolving tension without a causally earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on linear "and then" progression with a Deus ex machina resolution (the figure explaining the plot). The ending dissolves into summary ("Over the following days"), violating the short-story scope and deflating tension. Causality is driven by magic, not character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path but deflates tension with an "explain-everything" monologue at the climax. The protagonist's agency is limited to asking a question and listening to the answer, resulting in a resolution that lacks earned cost or ingenuity. The "final warning" is mentioned but never dramatized, weakening the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a decisive change or cost; the protagonist succeeds in her goal immediately through a magical ritual with no obstacle. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the world is simply improved, failing the requirement for a legible price or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the resolution relies on a magical object (the scroll) acting as a Deus Ex Machina to deliver the answer. Causality is weak; the protagonist observes the scroll, which triggers a vision that solves her problem without her exerting active agency or paying a cost. The implication of her death (1989-2021) is introduced but not rigorously integrated into the logic of her "present" actions.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path with no causality driving the epiphany; the realization is simply declared. Closure is a "soft reset" where sentimental understanding resolves the scene without any visible or felt cost. The ending explains everything, leaving no resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" where the environment mirrors the protagonist's mood (pathetic fallacy) rather than exerting independent pressure; the rain stops simply because she smiles. There is no causal cost to the resolution; the conflict dissolves instantly upon her first attempt to address it using a convenient breathing exercise. This creates a circular, low-stakes structure where the world lacks solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "soft reset" ending where a magical action resolves the central emotional problem without cost. The story lacks a true turning point; the protagonist enters wanting to apologize and simply does so. The causality is purely mechanical (she channels energy, problem solved), missing the complexity required for a literary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unhindered success without causal resistance or "because/therefore" turning points. Closure is achieved through a magical merging that entails no visible or felt cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a decisive change earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality is weak; the pivotal discovery relies on the coincidence of dropping the key to reveal a notch, rather than character agency or skill. The closure is a classic "prize" ending (finding an explanatory scroll) that resolves the mystery via exposition rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality dissolves into dream logic when the intruder fades away, breaking the established physical reality; the resolution relies on passive acceptance of a lecture rather than an earned decision.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear reflection lacking causal turns or meaningful complication. The ending ("ready to begin") constitutes false closure, offering a promise of future action rather than a resolution with visible cost or reconfiguration in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot hinges on an expository realization block ("As the night wore on, Eli began to understand") rather than causal action. The resolution offers a "soft reset" where magic solves the conflict without a visible, paid cost; the ending arrives via epiphany rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Her investigation led her to...") that bypasses the actual scene work of discovery, deflating tension. The story lacks a causal chain; events happen because the author wills them to fit the prompt, not because of character agency. The ending offers a thematic summary rather than a dramatic closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a magical artifact (the clock) instantly resolves the central problem without complication or cost. The causality is dream-like, lacking the friction or setbacks required to make the resolution feel earned. The ending relies on a Deus Ex Machina explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory: signal, travel, arrival, epiphany. The inciting incident ("constellations paused") functions as a convenience that removes urgency rather than adding pressure. Closure is a "soft reset" where harmony is restored and the protagonist returns home unchanged except for a conceptual realization, lacking a decisive turn or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot relies on a "magic wand" resolution where the pen fixes the anomaly without cost, setback, or earned causality (a "soft reset" anti-pattern). The narrative arc is linear and predictable, lacking a decisive turning point where the outcome is truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative arc is driven by magical convenience—the camera clicking without film—rather than causal efficacy or protagonist agency. The resolution feels unearned because the central obstacle (being forgotten) is solved by a prop's impossible behavior rather than a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is a linear "fetch quest" where progression relies on implausible leaps (matching brushstrokes between a woven tapestry and a painting) rather than causal logic. Closure is achieved through a convenient scroll that explains the theme, lacking any felt cost or decisive change in the character's status.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on magical convenience rather than causality; drumming fingers arbitrarily solves the central mystery without earned struggle or logical progression. The resolution is a "soft reset" that reframes the conflict as a gift without exacting a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot relies on video-game logic: find map, find key, meet NPC with lock, open door. The "resistance" of the labyrinth is flavor text that never forces a deviation or hard choice. Closure is unearned; the protagonist simply unlocks a door and walks into light, offering a "Decisive Change" in location but zero felt cost or sacrifice. The ending relies on a "summary explanation" that asserts meaning rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where a magical interaction instantly resolves deep psychological trauma, bypassing narrative friction or logical causality. The connection between the shutter-weaving and the Stranger's epiphany is symbolic rather than causal, leaving the mechanism of change opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary ("As the days passed") and violates the short-story scope by spanning weeks without a dramatized scene. The plot follows a flat "and-then" trajectory where the protagonist faces no obstacles—the universe literally conspires to help him—leading to an unearned, symmetric satisfaction at the end. Causality is nonexistent; things happen simply because the protagonist plans them.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where events happen to the protagonist via magical logic (dream, call, appearing island) rather than causal agency. The climax ("letting go") is an internal shift described abstractly without visible resistance or consequences. The resolution relies on a "conceptual repricing" that feels unearned because the cost (losing the scrimshaw) is minimal and the struggle is nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative structure is static, functioning more as an extended mood piece than a causal sequence; the closure (placing the heart) creates a legible Earned Stasis, but the path there is paved with exposition rather than active pressure. The reliance on explaining the "mandate" slows momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where success is predetermined by the setting's responsiveness. Causality is magical and convenient ("the world shifted"), lacking a "because/therefore" logic that forces the protagonist to adapt. The closure—a successful transformation—feels unearned because the "ban" and "boundaries" offer no actual opposition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot advances via coincidence (the reed vibrating by itself) rather than character agency. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," resolving all threads neatly without the required felt or conceptual cost for a high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal friction or obstacles; the machine and lens work perfectly on the first try. Closure is a soft thematic summary ("exhausted but enlightened") lacking a dramatized cost or decisive change in the protagonist's status.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina—the glowing curtains—to resolve the central tension instantly, bypassing causal logic or earned progression. The ending serves as a "soft reset" where magic creates a positive emotional shift ("renewed determination") without any visible or felt price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where a measuring tape and cards inexplicably decode a blockchain spreadsheet without procedural logic or difficulty. The closure is unearned; the protagonist faces no setbacks, pays no cost, and simply "realizes" the truth, resulting in a tidy, consequence-free victory.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear lock-and-key structure lacking genuine causal pressure or reversal; the solution (a word from a "half-burned scroll") is a convenience that bypasses struggle. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.6)
    The resolution relies on "magic object" logic (pressing a stone to a vial to create sculpture) that lacks established causal mechanics. The climax dissolves tension instantly via a sudden, convenient realization that the threat is actually benign, removing the need for a difficult decision. The narrative summary of the investigation skips the necessary procedural friction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story violates the "show, don't tell" principle, functioning as a reflective summary of off-page events rather than a dramatized scene. There is no causal drive; Elara sits, thinks about the past, and decides to be happy, which constitutes a "soft reset" ending without on-page cost or complication. The reflection-led structure flattens all narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot operates on dream logic and linear sequencing ("then she went here") rather than narrative causality. The closure relies on a "magic fix" ending where objects are combined to instantly resolve deep trauma, bypassing any meaningful cost or earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causal tension; events unfold as an "and then" sequence (arrive, project, realize, take) rather than a "because/therefore" chain. Closure is soft—a decision to keep the object—without a visible price paid or a meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo. The "incubation" process is asserted rather than demonstrated through a distinct mechanism or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no causal pressure or decisive turn; the protagonist simply waits and remembers. The ending ("she rested") is a soft stop that avoids closure or cost, reading more like a prologue than a complete story.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.5)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the clock instantly fixes the dying archive without explanation or cost. Causality is weak; Mara "realizes" the solution through convenient intuition rather than trial and error, depriving the climax of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot follows a linear "scavenger hunt" structure where the protagonist wanders until he conveniently finds the specific socket for his specific gear. The narrative relies on coincidence rather than causality, and the ending resolves the central question through a "gift" of insight without any visible cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic progression with low causal density; events happen to Mara rather than resulting from her agency. Closure relies on a symbolic "Conceptual Repricing" (the star stamp transfer) that feels mechanically vague and unearned by the preceding low-stakes walk. The "younger ferryman" appearance lacks setup or logic within the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative arc depends entirely on a "Magic Object Epiphany" (touching the bolt downloads knowledge) rather than earned causality. The resolution is convenient, bypassing the need for the protagonist to actively solve the central mystery or pay a price for the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on broad summary ("Days turned into nights") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope for a short story. The climax lacks logical grounding; the mechanism by which dropping an ink pellet reveals a political lie to a non-present kingdom is unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is functional but lacks causal tension; the narrative moves from observation to reflection to a convenient realization via a watermark not previously established as a challenge. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (changing the meaning of the tear from censorship to warning), but it feels low-stakes and intellectual, lacking a felt cost or necessary trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where a magical object resolves the protagonist's internal deficit without cost. The ending is a "gift" from the stone circle rather than a consequence of the protagonist's decisions, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality breaks significantly at the guard encounter, which functions as a soft reset where the antagonist dissolves without cost. The ending fails the closure requirement of a visible or felt price; the protagonist achieves a total win through convenient magical assistance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a predictable linear path where a physical slip triggers a convenient psychological resolution. The closure functions as a soft reset, resolving years of grief through a single moment of danger without sufficient narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" structure where the central problem evaporates because the character changes her mind, with no causal trigger or paid price. The climax is purely internal and abstract (rearranging cards), failing to meet the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The orientation is adequate, but the lack of resistance in the plot arc flattens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path: drone leads to tent, woman explains theme, vial provides closure. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where touching the ink resolves deep grief without a visible cost or decisive action, fitting the "explain-everything" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot follows a linear "and then" sequence with negligible resistance; obstacles like encryption vanish instantly ("flickering to life"). The "blink that follows surprise" serves as an awkward text insertion rather than a genuine time constraint or source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a montage ("As the days passed") to bridge the inciting incident and the resolution, skipping the actual conflict of defending the farm. The ending is a summary of success rather than a dramatized closure unit with visible cost. The threat introduced (father's enemies) is resolved off-page via exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and convenience rather than causality; walking in a zigzag arbitrarily summons the goddess, and the rail spike functions as a sudden deus ex machina. The resolution is an unearned "soft reset" where harmony is restored by magic, lacking a decisive change or felt cost. The closure is tidy but emotionally hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot follows a linear, low-tension "and then" structure with summary bridging key moments (the tea, the return at night) rather than dramatizing them. The resolution—recalibrating a single telescope—is a symbolic gesture that fails to logically address the established threat (a web of tracking political dissidents), leaving the actual problem unsolved. The "proof by contradiction" is namedropped but misapplied; the protagonist simply observes evidence directly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on coincidence (finding the exact relevant letters in a drawer) and a "soft reset" resolution where the conflict evaporates because the protagonist performs a symbolic action. Causality is weak; the connection between the firmware's dissonance and the letters is thematic rather than logical, and the ending lacks the required cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on dream logic where actions (placing a tile) yield disproportionate, unearned results (cosmic understanding). The closure is an abstract epiphany ("meaning was not found but created") that feels disconnected from any concrete struggle or paid cost. The "unlearning" provides a vague backdrop rather than a causal engine.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive lens; events progress through authorial fiat rather than character agency or logical consequence. The closure is unearned—placing a tile causes the sky to heal—and lacks any visible or felt cost. The ending summarizes a future success ("would one day be the norm") rather than dramatizing a decisive change in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality breaks significantly at the climax: Mara gives away her "anchor" (the coin), yet possesses it again in the final paragraph without explanation. This continuity error negates the sacrifice and renders the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes outline ("she felt," "she planned," "she painted") without causal pressure or accumulation of tension. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the act of creating art instantly resolves the weight of global trauma, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Days turned into weeks") rather than scene pressure, violating the short-story scope. The ending is a "gift" resolution where the environment solves the mystery for the character without cost or earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear progression of convenience with no obstacle or reversal; Elara simply sorts buttons until she finds the matching key by coincidence. The closure lacks any cost, felt or conceptual, resulting in a "happy ever after" that feels unearned and mechanically resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal tightening; the protagonist simply walks until she finds a reward (the letter) that resolves her emotional turmoil. The ending relies on a "gift" from an off-screen character rather than an earned change in the protagonist's stance. The "codes in accumulated snow" device strains plausibility (persistence, legibility) without explaining the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "guru on the mountaintop" structure where a stranger conveniently arrives to explain the theme, removing all agency from the protagonist. Closure is achieved via an "explain-everything" dialogue rather than action or cost. The "rain gutters" stopping at the exact moment of epiphany is apathetic fallacy that highlights the lack of causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on summary to resolve the conflict ("slowly began to heal," "began to teach") rather than a dramatized scene. The climax is an internal epiphany that resolves the mystery instantly without an on-page decisive change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.1)
    The plot is driven entirely by coincidence—the lockmaster arriving at the exact dock where his lost item was found—rather than causal agency. The closure (a romantic connection) is unearned, lacking any visible or felt cost; the narrative resolves perfectly without testing the protagonist’s goals or values.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "corridor" structure with no significant reversals, causal turns, or resistance. The resolution arrives via instant gratification ("in an instant... dissolved") rather than earned struggle, failing to provide the required closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic key" plot structure where the protagonist arrives, inserts an object into a slot, and achieves instant resolution without earned causality. The climax depends entirely on the convenient compatibility of the twig and the art installation, bypassing any logical cause-and-effect or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from an "easy button" resolution; the protagonist solves the central conflict by simply calibrating a device, facing no failure, adaptation, or sacrifice. The closure ("strange kind of peace") feels unearned because the victory required no significant price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution depends on soft-magic logic ("organ's melody... was a code") rather than causal agency. The "fallow period" setup functions as background context rather than a constraint that pressures the timeline or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    Causality is severely damaged by the encounter with the figure, which functions as a surreal deus ex machina rather than a plot point; the figure hands over evidence and vanishes without consequence. Closure is unearned, relying on a pathetic fallacy ("mist parted") to resolve a concrete cold case with a metaphorical sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot advances through convenience (immediate discovery of the journal) and mechanical steps rather than causal pressure. Closure acts as a "soft reset" that resolves the conflict without a legible on-page cost, failing the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is replaced by narrative convenience; the protagonist solves the mystery simply because the narration states they are "observant" and that things "made sense." The climax—discovering the structure—lacks logical scaffolding or mechanical difficulty, feeling like a teleportation to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot hinges on a "convenient journal" discovery to deliver backstory, a weak narrative device. Closure is asserted via thematic statement ("not to trap us, but to teach us") rather than earned through a decisive change or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on "and then" sequencing without causal tension; closure is an unearned epiphany ("understanding dawned") that offers total resolution without visible cost or sacrifice, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on "magic fixes magic" causality, where the seed acts as a convenient solution to the vortex. The closure functions as a soft reset—the lake heals and Eira feels lighter—lacking a visible, felt cost or lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path (find object, walk maze, place object) with no deviation or surprise. The ending is a "soft reset" where placing the clipping magically restores global harmony without requiring a sacrifice or visible cost from the protagonist. Causality is mechanical, relying on the "key in lock" trope rather than character agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the scene is oriented correctly, the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the antagonist voluntarily withdraws after a brief conversation, negating the established threat. The climax lacks causal teeth; the debt is dismissed as a misunderstanding ("This was never about the card") rather than paid or confronted with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a dramatic present; the protagonist sits, remembers, and realizes, resulting in a static scene with no active causality. Closure is a "soft reset"—a purely internal shift in attitude that resolves the conflict without external consequence, action, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative structure collapses from scene into summary ("Days turned into weeks"), dissolving tension. The closure is a "magic pill" resolution where an object grants instant wisdom without a visible, paid cost or causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina structure where a mysterious whisper provides the solution ("accepting contradictions") and a magical orb executes it. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" (problem arises, problem fixed) without the requisite cost or complication to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest devoid of obstacles or causal pressure; the protagonist simply walks forward and accepts a destiny explained to her by the narrator. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where she gains purpose without paying any visible price or facing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a "Magical Stranger" trope—a convenient acquaintance appearing in a deserted station to deliver the thematic thesis. While the final internal shift (drawing the map) qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing, the lack of causal necessity in the man's arrival undermines the story’s structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure driven by a guiding object rather than protagonist agency. Tension is low as the character faces no obstacles; she enters, intuitively knows what to do ("knew this was the moment"), and succeeds without setback. Closure is structurally present but lacks earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a weak divinatory device (reading coffee stains) to drive the protagonist's critical decision, stripping her of agency. The climax resolves through a "magic button" mechanic where the violin simply fixes the problem, resulting in a low-stakes, convenient resolution. Closure is present but feels unearned due to the linear, instruction-following plot.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B structure, but the resolution is a soft reset where a new character explains the solution, removing agency and struggle. Closure lands via a "Conceptual Repricing" (valuing stillness) but lacks the requisite cost or resistance to make it resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies entirely on coincidence and magical convenience—the hairpin suddenly reveals a map, the shell teleports her, and a spirit explains the resolution. The ending is an &quot;explain-everything&quot; moment that resolves the conflict via a magic bath without any felt cost or sacrifice from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a flat, procedural line (observe, listen, write, leave) with no causal complications or meaningful turns. Closure is unearned, offering a sense of "fulfillment" without any prior risk, obstacle, or paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a decision, but the closure lacks a felt price; the risk of "chaos" is theoretical and not visible in the scene. The "soft reset" ending, where speaking instantly unburdens her, bypasses the complexity of the dilemma established.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking causality; the protagonist simply waits for an event (birds) to deliver a realization without obstacle. The closure is a conceptual summary that resolves the intellectual query without any visible, felt, or conceptual cost, failing the specific closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.6)
    Causality collapses at the climax when the lethal trap stops simply because the spire "acknowledged his effort," creating a Deus Ex Machina resolution. The protagonist's agency is undermined by the environment's convenient benevolence, stripping the ending of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on extreme convenience; the hatch opens with "surprising ease" and the underwater library is inexplicably dry, bypassing physical logic without establishing world rules. The inciting incident and resolution are linked by a frictionless linear path (see light -> follow light -> find book) lacking causal complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes checklist: arrive, activate machine, succeed. The resolution (rebirthing the universe) is unearned, achieved through a "magic button" mechanic without visible cost or complication. Causality is arbitrary—there is no logical bridge explaining why dipping coins in static essence reverses cosmic contraction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a low-resistance linear path where the ritual succeeds immediately without complication, friction, or cost. The lack of causal obstacles or a "fail" state makes the closure feel inevitable and unearned, as the environment yields perfectly to the protagonist's desires.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is a linear progression of tasks (clean, mend, ring) without causal friction or setbacks. The closure—a cosmic realignment—feels unearned because the mechanism is purely symbolic and lacks a legible cost; the "impossibility" is solved simply because the protagonist tries hard.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on extreme convenience—a "trail of photographs" acting as breadcrumbs and a wind chime signaling the start—which breaks plausibility. The resolution is unearned; complex communal trauma is resolved instantly by a single exhibit, exemplifying the "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where the ending is tidy rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.3)
    The plot follows a linear path of convenience—the starlings mirror her thoughts, a flame beckons her, and the crystal glows—removing all causal friction. The ending is a "soft reset" that resolves the central tension through magical realization without a visible cost or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on summary and internal assertion ("pattern finally revealed itself") rather than causal action to resolve the central conflict. The climax dissolves the obstacle through vague "newfound confidence" and mental processing, lacking a concrete, logical progression of events or a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on a "magic feather" resolution where shattering the jar instantly cures deep trauma without established causality or cost. The subplot involving history rewriting itself is disconnected from the main action, creating a disjointed frame that fails to impact the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Over the next days") that dissipates tension, violating the short-story scope defaults. The resolution hinges on a causality break: the protagonist solves the puzzle by accidentally dropping the key into the water, a "lucky" move that unearnedly resolves the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, relying on a "task-success" loop without causal complications or tactical pivots. Orientation is weak; the spatial relationship between the "echo chamber tunnel" and the "household" is never established, leaving the action ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    The inciting incident relies on a convenient, unexplained arrival of the pendant ("as if the library itself had placed it"), bypassing causal setup. The climax is mechanical: a mysterious figure appears solely to explain the stakes and offer a binary choice in dialogue. While the closure (renunciation) works conceptually, the path there feels like a plot outline rather than an organic progression of events.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure follows a "magic wand" causality where an abstract realization immediately solves the central problem without material friction. The ending is a soft reset that grants total success ("purpose fulfilled") without a legible cost or consequence. The connection between the "broken crozier" and the "sapling" acts as symbolic convenience rather than mechanical cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" logic where mental epiphanies instantly fix physical machinery without mechanical causality. The inciting incident and climax are linked only by abstract assertions of "letting go," lacking a concrete process or "because/therefore" chain. The closure is a "magical fix" that revitalizes the city without a legible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=2.3)
    A catastrophic continuity error invalidates the climax: Mara gives the hourglass to the transient outside the rift, yet acts as if she still possesses it inside the chamber to reset time ("Using the hourglass as a focal point"). The ending is an unearned "magic fix" that resets the world without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure where magic solves problems without defined mechanics or cost; "weaving" is an omnipotent tool that lacks constraints. The closure is a soft reset where the gallery dissolves and a summary statement claims she changed, but the "unraveling" risk is never realized or paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" summary ("Weeks turned into months") to resolve the central conflict, skipping the actual turning point where the Council is persuaded. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—total victory with no visible cost—violating the requirement for a dramatized closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest (find aid → follow beep → find photo) lacking causal complications or pressure. Closure is soft and unearned; success is guaranteed by the premise, and the ending ("warm," "sanctuary") is a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with low causal density; the protagonist arrives, retrieves the item, and leaves. The climax relies on a magical phase transition that resolves the central mystery without requiring a difficult choice or sacrifice. The resolution is unearned, relying on convenient tidal changes for escape.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality relies on "magical hacking" where a physical inkblot arbitrarily becomes digital data without logical grounding. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" attempt that fails because the "wisdom" is granted without cost or sacrifice; the ending is a painless realization ("she smiled") rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot is a linear quest resolved by a convenient coincidence (the sudden appearance of the birds) rather than causal logic. The closure is a "fix-it" ending where the problem is solved by magic with no lasting consequence or conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending; the physical threat of the awakening cryptids is neutralized instantly by the protagonist's laughter, lacking logical causality or visible cost. The resolution disconnects from the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic key" resolution where the locust shell solves the conflict instantly without earned causality. The climax lacks a meaningful trial; the statues advance and are immediately destroyed by the roots, bypassing any escalation or back-and-forth struggle. The ending provides closure (statues destroyed) but lacks any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure resolved by a magical object that fixes the central conflict without protagonist sacrifice. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—mission accomplished, peace achieved—undercutting the tension with a cost-free resolution. The chase sequence is a brief obstacle that does not fundamentally alter the stakes or the protagonist's strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot progresses through convenience ("stumbled upon," "wrong turn") rather than agency. Closure is achieved via a magical "fix-all" event where singing instantly restores the carousel, lacking a causal link to the carpenter's skills or a paid cost for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear success chain with no causal friction; the ritual works perfectly on the first try. The climax introduces a problem ("the place was fading") and resolves it instantly via a vague gesture ("reached out") without cost or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the environment magically solves the protagonist's internal conflict. The "pulsing light" and the painting that moves on its own remove the need for active problem-solving or sacrifice. The ending acts as a "soft reset," resolving a lifelong longing with a single magical moment, lacking the necessary cost for true closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence with minimal resistance; the "living" vault yields immediately to a key and a whisper, robbing the climax of tension. Closure is weak and purely assertive ("everything around her felt different") without a visible, decisive change or paid cost on the page. Orientation is abstract ("shadowed nexus"), lacking concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear scavenger-hunt structure driven by convenient discoveries (the exact locket, a note addressing her specific situation) rather than causal agency. The ending provides a "finding the map" moment rather than true narrative closure or consequence. The reliance on a *deus ex machina* note to explain the plot deflates the mystery's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "task completion" arc with no significant obstacles or costs; the challenge is declared ("greatest challenge") but resolved instantly with "hands steadied" and words flowing. Causality is soft; the "geometry of tea leaves" solves the riddle through vague assertion rather than a decipherable process. The ending offers a tidy resolution ("portal," "bridge") without an earned price or meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's status.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unhindered success with no causal friction or stakes. There is no inciting incident or rising action; Elara intends to plant the seed, does so, and succeeds immediately, lacking the requisite "closure with cost" or meaningful change. The plot is an outline of a ritual rather than a dramatized event.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path, but the central obstacle—a stubborn knot—is resolved by a vague "plea," effectively a soft reset without agency or cost. The closure brings the task to a finish but relies on a realization that feels asserted rather than earned through structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Hours turned into days") to bypass the central effort, stripping the climax of tension and causality. The spatial logic is incoherent, placing an outdoor "henge" and "rain-scoured" walls inside a "fresco vault," creating an impossible physical stage.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.7)
    Causality is weak; the plot advances via convenience (finding a map, then a letter that explains the theme) rather than protagonist agency. A severe orientation failure exists regarding physics: Elara "sits cross-legged" reading "brittle" paper in a "sunken" wreck, then "swims" out, creating a contradictory air/water environment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unhindered success; the ritual works perfectly on the first try without complication or setback. The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction" where everyone wins, failing to provide the required closure cost or a decisive change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a strict "and-then" linear sequence (floor by floor) without causal linkage or escalating pressure. The plot relies on convenient discoveries (finding pages/keys easily) rather than earned progress. Closure is a "soft reset" where a diary quote instantly resolves the protagonist's internal anguish without cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on a "Soft Reset" ending: the physical crisis (broken string) is resolved by a metaphysical vision, erasing the inciting incident without logical causality or cost. The connection between jumping into a cloud and the mechanical repair of the gondola is nonexistent, shattering suspension of disbelief. The closure is unearned because the protagonist pays no price for her survival.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with low causal density; obstacles are overcome immediately via the protagonist's innate "gift" and the coin key. The climax is summarized ("Hours passed... Elara worked") rather than dramatized, robbing the scene of tension. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction ending where the protagonist succeeds completely without cost, followed by a convenient escape.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is driven by extreme convenience and coincidence: the phrasebook falls open to the exact necessary page, and the birds outside mirror the board's pattern at the precise moment required. The discovery of a hatch "never noticed before" in a familiar workspace breaks credibility. Closure is a costless victory without a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression with no meaningful obstacles; the "hall of mirrors" threatens danger but releases her immediately upon a "deep breath," resulting in zero cost. The conclusion offers symmetric satisfaction, resolving the quest with unearned "newfound confidence" and harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the problem is solved simply by deciding to solve it. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect restoration with no visible or felt cost—violating the requirement for closure with a price. Causality is soft; obstacles are mentioned (weeds, missing clapper) but overcome instantly in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a functional arc with a clear beginning and end, but causality is soft, relying on abstract magic ("nested patterns") without established constraints. The climax—using blood to mend the puppet—lacks setup, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned through mechanism. Closure is achieved, but the "doomsday" stakes feel disconnected from the small-scale action of fixing a toy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central puzzle (the nut’s impressions forming a map) resolves instantly without friction, and the climax is summarized ("Using the map, she led them") rather than dramatized. This creates a convenience-based plot where the solution appears exactly when the problem (the traveler) arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is a "soft reset," resolving the central problem through a sudden, unearned realization without external causality or cost. The ending explains the resolution rather than dramatizing a decisive change or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the central problem (a fragmented library) is resolved by a magical object ("bottled moonlight") without earning the resolution. The ending relies on a convenient "fix-everything" event that aligns the shelves and writes the story automatically, failing the closure requirement for a visible, felt cost or trade-off. Causality is replaced by symbolic assertion ("she knew it was no accident").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with a "soft reset" ending where the obstacle dissolves upon contact. The inciting incident is summarized ("quest led her"), and the resolution lacks a causal cost; the problem is solved by the magic system working exactly as intended, devoid of narrative friction or unexpected consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.1)
    Causality is weak; the resolution is unearned as the community heals instantly via song without resistance or logical progression. The mechanism of the clock's repair is magical convenience, failing to exact the required felt cost for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks causal drive; the protagonist faces no resistance or cost while performing the central action. Closure is an unearned realization ("understood her purpose") that arrives without the requisite struggle or sacrifice to give it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where environmental conveniences (gravity inversion, mist bowing) resolve obstacles for the protagonist. Causality breaks at the climax: Elara whispers a "forgotten combination" she somehow knows without an on-page discovery moment, rendering the "doodle map" setup disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear process description that lacks causal friction, resistance, or a defining turning point. Closure fails the requirement for visible or felt cost; the ending is a "perfect success" state (the sculpture is healed, the character smiles) that exacts no price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    Causality breaks at the climax when the solution is delivered by external magic (the nexus moving the pieces) rather than the protagonist's action. The "next phase" and "eclipsed covenant" remain vague concepts that fail to generate concrete narrative drive or legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal friction; the protagonist encounters an obstacle (locked clasp) and overcomes it instantly via an undefined ability ("tuning her frequencies"). The ending lacks a valid closure unit with cost; the "revelation" is unearned by struggle, and the final beat is a soft reset into unearned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure lacks causal pressure, relying on convenient timing ("suddenly, the air shifted") to resolve the central tension. The climax is a passive reception of wisdom rather than a result of the protagonist's actions or decisions. Orientation is maintained, but the closure—a realization without cost—feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the protagonist faces no genuine setbacks; the artifact acts as a universal key that solves navigation and the climax automatically. Closure is unearned because the resolution requires no sacrifice or ingenuity, only the placement of an object in a slot. The "source of resilience" is literalized magic rather than a causal outcome of the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot is a linear procedural with weak causality; deductions arrive instantly via convenient intuition rather than investigation. The closure is a summary of the theme ("hindsight was all she had") rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's state, and the "singular convergence" logic feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of "setup, wait, execute, succeed" without deviation, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" where the outcome perfectly matches the intent. There is no Decisive Change with visible cost; the success is absolute and unearned by sacrifice or tactical adaptation. The closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where obstacles are resolved by convenience (driftwood markers) rather than agency. The ending provides total success without the required felt or conceptual cost, resulting in a "happy ending" that fails the rubric's closure definition.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a "soft reset" ending where a magical interaction resolves the conflict without cost or sacrifice. The climax—being briefly overwhelmed—leads immediately to a summary realization ("he felt changed") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration earned by the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the causality is soft; events happen to the protagonist rather than resulting from her agency. The closure is an "explanation ending" where a secondary character reveals the plot's meaning, resulting in low dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (setup, attempt, success, realization) with no causal turns or reversals. The closure brings no cost; the "lesson in humility" is an asserted summary rather than a dramatic consequence of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure driven by coincidence (finding the box) and magical guidance rather than causal agency. The transition from finding the puzzle to following it is smooth, but the lack of obstacles makes the progression feel automatic. Closure is achieved through a high-fantasy transformation that feels conceptually detached from the weaver's specific skills.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Hours turned into days") for the rising action, stripping the journey of tension. The climax is mechanical, and the resolution involves an unexplained teleportation back to the surface ("found himself back"), which is a significant causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where an NPC explains the plot and hands over the resolution. Causality is broken by magical convenience; the narrative arc is a linear sequence of acquisitions with no cost paid for the "truth."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality collapses at the pivotal moment: Elias rearranges the stones (2-3-1) with no on-page logic or clue, solving the puzzle via convenient authorial fiat. The conflict ("warning") is resolved by simply relighting the lamp, failing to address the established threat or the "haunted" nature of the disturbance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on convenience; the beam initiates the plot independently, and the protagonist’s "realization" is an unearned epiphany that resolves the conflict. The closure—a successful dawn with a gratitude chorus—lacks a visible or felt cost, reading as a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where success was inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where a problem is identified and immediately solved with a platitude. The inciting incident (the magnetic pull) leads smoothly to the resolution without any complication, reversal, or misunderstanding. Closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no obstacles to his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on magical convenience and "and then" sequencing, where the sextant heals itself without the protagonist's active agency or ingenuity. Causality is broken by the object's automatic resolution, leading to a "Symmetric Satisfaction" ending where the problem vanishes without cost. The closure feels unearned, as the solution is external to the character's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure that lacks a Decisive Change with visible cost; the ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the realm is perfectly restored without sacrifice. The climax removes protagonist agency, as the solution (the lullaby) is whispered to her by the environment rather than earned through struggle. The resolution feels unearned and devoid of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on summary ("began to delve," "more she learned") to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and the climax, dissolving tension. The resolution—a life-altering epiphany triggered by looking at a blank book—feels unearned and lacks causal necessity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causal pressure or meaningful obstacles; events unfold as a series of fortunate coincidences (finding fresh bread, a tea house, and a plaque that explicitly validates her) with no resistance. Closure fails the cost requirement; the ending is a moment of unearned validation without a decisive change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks genuine causality; the climax is a Deus Ex Machina where the slide transforms and explains the plot to the protagonist. Closure is a costless realization ("heart alight with purpose") that fails the requirement for a visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on coincidence (the fortune teller's vague hint) and authorial fiat (thieves crumbling immediately upon hearing a cliché speech) to advance. Causality breaks at the climax; the resolution is a "soft reset" where opposition evaporates without cost or logical cause. The ending claims a victory ("thwarted the thieves") that is not mechanically substantiated by the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers from severe "prologue syndrome," ending exactly where the story should begin ("She knew this was only the beginning"), offering no closure or cost. The plot relies entirely on a "wizard in the woods" figure explaining the premise and resolving the mystery through dialogue rather than dramatized discovery. Causality is weak; events occur because she is summoned, not because of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on a convenient deus ex machina (finding a hidden painting after a decade of residence) to resolve the central problem, stripping the protagonist of agency. The Inciting Incident and Climax are almost simultaneous, bypassing the necessary escalation of pressure. Closure is unearned, resting on a prop discovery rather than a causal chain of decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (find map, go to place, fix problem) with minimal causal friction. The resolution—etching words to physically restore water—operates on unearned symbolic logic that breaks causality; the mechanism connecting the postal plate to the city's hydro-engineering is missing. The "hidden chamber" is reached via summary, bypassing the potential for earned struggle or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "task completion" arc with no causal pressure or deviation; everything proceeds exactly as planned without obstacle. The ending lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, offering instead a low-stakes reset where she packs up her tools. The drive lens is weak because success is guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot follows a linear "problem-solution" path where the resolution is achieved via a convenient, pre-existing ability ("miniaturization protocols") rather than tactical ingenuity or sacrifice. The connection between the magnetic shift and the box is coincidental, and the closure—while stating a cost—feels like a soft reset where the problem (static) simply evaporates after the task is done.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenience and exposition rather than causality; the connection between the locket and the mailbox is a coincidence resolved by a key conveniently hidden in the object Clara already possesses. Mrs. Ellis serves as an "Explain-Everything" device, dissolving the mystery immediately upon appearance. The closure is tidy and unearned, lacking the "felt cost" required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where obstacles are overcome instantly by "understanding" or magic, devoid of causal friction. The ending fails the closure requirement, offering a "to be continued" promise of future action ("task was far from over") rather than a decisive change or paid cost on the page. Events happen conveniently to facilitate the protagonist's progress without earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "wish fulfillment" path where the protagonist wants answers, performs a ritual, and receives them without obstacle or cost. The climax is elided ("What happened next was beyond description"), bypassing the critical moment of discovery. The ending fails the Closure test as it provides symmetric satisfaction without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or any legible price paid for the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a standard "ritual success" arc where the resolution is earned merely by a "final surge of will," lacking a causal twist or tactical adaptation. The ending restores the status quo without a legible "Decisive Change" or felt cost, resulting in a soft reset rather than a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear instruction-manual structure (stranger appears, explains magic system, protagonist complies) rather than a dramatic arc with pressure. The ending functions as a prologue to a different story rather than a resolution of this scene's tension. The "antique seal" is set up as a key but is effectively abandoned for the "sugar" solution, creating a disconnect in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot follows a linear "and then" structure driven by external forces (the garden urging, the shell choosing) rather than causal linkages. The climax relies on a deus ex machina figure explaining the resolution, resulting in a soft reset where the protagonist is transformed without paying a visible price. The narrative lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the ending is a convenient summary of success.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and provides clear closure, but the progression is linear with low friction. The "heritage rose thorn" functions as a convenient tool that resolves the conflict physically without forcing a complex tactical trade-off or unforeseen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist simply arrives and receives an explanation. There is no causal chain of decisions; the "secrets... earned" are handed over by an NPC, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear process story: finding an object, performing a ritual, and succeeding without complication. The closure is a "magic fix" (the globe clears) that feels unearned because there was no resistance or possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a vignette rather than a causal story; the protagonist observes and reflects but faces no obstacle. Closure is a "soft reset"—she seeks peace and finds it immediately without struggle or reconfiguration of options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on magical convenience rather than causal agency, particularly when the letters spontaneously rearrange themselves to reveal the plot. The climax hinges on a sudden ability to "chant" a barrier, which disconnects from the established skillset of a conspiracy theorist. This deus ex machina resolution undermines the tension and causality required for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene container with a summary bridge ("Over the following weeks") that deflates tension. Causality is external; the protagonist acts because a voice commands it, leading to a "new dawn" resolution that feels unearned and convenient rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.0)
    Causality is weak; the central obstacle (a jammed box) resolves merely because the protagonist whispers to it, not through a costly tactic. The closure ("felt whole") is an unearned realization that restates the initial goal without a visible price or distinct narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the climax relies on a *deus ex machina* (the key acting on its own) to resolve the central deception. The closure ("Elara stood alone") is an unearned return to status quo with no structural change or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative violates short-story scope defaults by summarizing a season-long process ("days were spent," "winter deepened") rather than dramatizing a specific turning point. Causality is absent; the climax ("she understood") is an unearned epiphany triggered by touching a prop, not by a pressure-cooked choice. The ending is a summary of success rather than a resonant closure unit with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot moves via "video game logic" where objects (journal, symbols, false wall) act as passive keys rather than active complications. The chain of discovery—seeing scratches, finding a journal, finding a secret room, finding a damning photo—relies entirely on convenience and lack of opposition. Closure is unearned; the "freedom" is granted by finding a prop, not by a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with clear orientation, but the causality is soft; the resolution relies on a "wise dispenser" trope where a secondary character explains the theme to fix the protagonist's problem. The closure (resolve to act) feels asserted rather than causally earned by the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on weak causality; the pivotal breakthrough is "stumbled upon" rather than earned through specific deductive action. The climax—a holographic projection physically ringing and causing environmental upheaval—breaks the established mechanical logic without explanation, and the closure lacks any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The causal chain is coherent but relies on "video game logic" where a popular song's rhythm conveniently matches deep-space coordinates. The resolution comes too easily; the "old terminal" bypass is a soft obstacle that dissolves immediately without genuine cost or struggle. The narrative feels more like a summary of an investigation than a dramatized crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    The plot relies on magical convenience and an "explain-everything" ending where "unseen forces" solve the physical puzzle. The narrative lacks causal drive; Elara moves from location to location because the script demands it, not because of organic necessity or logical deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.0)
    Closure acts as a soft reset; the protagonist gains peace ("weight lift") without paying a visible price or making a difficult choice. The narrative is linear and observational, lacking the causal tightening required for a 600-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks a causal chain or genuine external pressure; the "sentinel" duty (protecting grapes from cold) is a false setup that never constrains action. The resolution is a "soft reset" epiphany triggered by looking at scenery, lacking visible or felt cost. The ending resolves the internal tension too easily, bypassing the need for a decisive change or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear checklist of tasks with no unexpected obstacles or reversals. The "flicker of movement" offers false tension that resolves immediately, and the climax is a mechanical success without risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causality or obstacle; Elara intends to heal the space, does so without resistance, and leaves feeling better. This "soft reset" ending lacks a Decisive Change with visible cost. The drive lens is nominally accumulative, but the tension never rises, leading to a flat structure where the outcome is guaranteed from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot is linear and process-based, lacking a moment of decisive change where the protagonist must risk something personal to succeed. The resolution relies on the convenient discovery of the "seed" pattern, and the cost (the crystal's energy) is external and abstract rather than a result of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a linear progression of walking and marking, lacking causal turns or escalating complications. The closure relies on a coincidence—the driftwood markers forming a circle he "hadn't intended"—which removes agency from the pivotal moment. While the final renunciation of the chalk provides a legible ending state, it feels unearned by the low-stakes wandering that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path with weak causality; the resolution ("reimagine it") is a soft reset that solves an abstract problem without material difficulty or sacrifice. The connection between the "falling leaf" and the mechanical solution is thematic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a friction-free linear path where the central obstacle (years of estrangement) dissolves instantly upon a single phone call. The closure creates a "happy ending" without any visible or felt cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction that lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" where touching a machine conveniently restores lost memory, bypassing the need for dramatized problem-solving. The climax—activating a key to banish shadows—is a linear completion of a task rather than a decision forged in fire; the "loops" concept is introduced but largely summarized, robbing the structure of necessary friction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure lacking causal surprise or deepening complications. The resolution is a "soft reset" where a convenient symbolic object ("stone carried since childhood") is exchanged to instantly resolve the conflict, bypassing the need for a genuine, hard-won tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no causal turns; success is achieved through effortless process rather than problem-solving. The ending offers a "success" state without visible cost or trade-off, lacking the required Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent under a Situational lens, moving from solitude to connection, but relies on significant convenience. Kai's arrival with sketches of the exact same ephemeral icicle patterns creates a "perfect fit" resolution that feels unearned. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration, but the lack of obstacles makes the peace feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes fetch quest structure where obstacles are overcome by the environment yielding (the mist shifts, the path appears). Closure is a "soft reset" where placing the shell magically resolves the protagonist's writer's block without a causal price. The drive lens is weak, relying on dream logic rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative suffers from a lack of causality; the central obstacle is resolved by convenient magic ("Suddenly, fragments of melody filled her mind") rather than protagonist agency. The closure provides a "symmetric satisfaction" where everything aligns perfectly without a felt or conceptual cost, failing the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (task start → task end) lacking causal complications or a decisive turn; closure is merely the cessation of labor without a legible cost or reconfigured stance; the "tremor" pseudo-conflict resolves immediately without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a linear "symmetric satisfaction" arc where the protagonist desires a fix, works without interruption, and succeeds completely. The ending fails the closure requirement of a visible or felt cost; the resolution is a pure victory that resets the world to a better state without sacrifice. The climax relies on a convenient realization about "reflection angles" that feels unearned by the summarized labor ("Days turned into nights").

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from established stasis to a decisive change, but the transition lacks friction. The inciting incident (the figure's arrival) leads directly to the resolution without meaningful complication, making the closure feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative lacks causal drive; the central action (carving) proceeds without resistance ("the ash wood seemed to cooperate"), rendering the closure unearned. The ending is a summary of emotional resolution rather than a dramatic change forced by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.5)
    A continuity break undermines the timeline: the narrator states she found the wheel "weeks ago," yet she pries it from the mud in the present moment. The closure is unearned; the resolution comes from a magical voice providing a pep talk, removing the need for the protagonist to pay a price or make a difficult decision to achieve the shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative operates on dream logic rather than causality; a civil engineer "redirecting flows of memory" to resurrect a terminal is magical realism, not a causal plot. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where everything succeeds without obstacle or cost, failing the Closure cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.0)
    The ending functions as a "soft reset," resolving the central tension (duty vs. desire) through a realization that dissolves the problem without a visible or felt cost. The causality is linear but lacks resistance; the transition from hearing the word "bear" to fixing the clock and finding total peace is a leap of convenience rather than a hard-won consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist simply walks to the correct location and finds the solution immediately. Causality is replaced by "instinct" and magical intervention; the sundial glows and rearranges itself to reveal the truth, resolving the central mystery via *deus ex machina*. The ending offers a "promise of clarity" but fails to deliver a concrete disclosure or exact a visible cost from the character. The closure feels unearned because no obstacles were overcome to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks causality; obstacles are removed immediately by "letting her mind drift" rather than through effort or ingenuity. The resolution is unearned, relying on the convenient revelation that the map was waiting specifically for her. Closure is purely positive and lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; it is a "happy ending" without price.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves a form of Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression relies on a linear, low-resistance path where the premise's "magic" works instantly. Causality is soft; the transition from stranger to intimate healer happens without earned trust or accumulated pressure. The ending provides closure but feels mechanically tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("countless nights") before rushing the central discovery. The climax hinges on the machine explicitly explaining the plot's resolution ("understand its cost"), which deflates tension. Closure is present as a conceptual shift, but the causality feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, but the causality is weak; the resolution (finding peace) feels unearned by the low-stakes physical action of planting seeds. The closure lacks a visible, felt cost beyond minor physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear fetch quest ("scavenger hunt") where the protagonist obeys written instructions to move from point A to B to C without complication. The ending violates the closure requirement by offering a "magic fix-it" resolution where the city is healed instantly with no visible or felt cost to the protagonist. Causality is replaced by convenient compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.9)
    A fatal logic flaw undermines the narrative: the protagonist seeks "light without fire" while standing amidst "bioluminescent blooms," rendering the central problem solved before the plot begins. The resolution relies on a magical realization via the artifact rather than causal action, and the ending lacks a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-pressure path: observe, remember, realize, resolve. The central epiphany (grief as migration) arrives via a convenient visual association (ribbon + butterflies) rather than earned narrative causality or cost. The resolution is a "soft reset" that dissolves the declared difficulty without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative structure collapses into summary ("As days turned into weeks") right when the conflict should escalate, bypassing scene-level causality. The resolution is unearned, as the town's deep-seated issues vanish instantly upon hearing aphorisms, lacking a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of finding and decoding without causal complication or genuine reversal. Closure is asserted via summary ("he had found something extraordinary") rather than an on-page event with visible cost; the epiphany is unearned by the preceding low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.7)
    The plot relies on a deus ex machina resolution where a magical object instantly solves the central conflict without cost or complication. Causality is broken; the protagonist discards his tools (models) for magic, leading to an unearned "and then" transformation of the world. No visible or felt cost charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks causal friction; the protagonist desires a story, the radio provides it immediately, and she succeeds without obstacle or cost. A significant logic gap undermines the central action: she transcribes lyrics in a "language she couldn’t quite place" yet somehow understands they are about specific themes (heroes, villains, betrayal).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and low-stakes, moving from entrance to reflection to execution without a causal turn or complication. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction—she came to do a task and did it—lacking a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that alters the status quo with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure breaks tension with a summary montage ("Days turned into weeks") that glosses over the central relationship's development. The climax relies on an external coincidence (the collapse) to force movement, denying the protagonist a proactive role in the escalation. The ending feels rushed and unearned by the preceding summary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative structure relies on a mid-story summary bridge ("Weeks passed") that skips the actual work of the conflict, violating the short-form scope default. The resolution is effectively magical—the rosette glows and voices harmonize automatically—removing causal pressure. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem of hatred is solved by a single performance, lacking the required closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on the "celestial alignment" as a convenience to bypass the difficulty of growth, removing tension. The ending is an unearned utopian fix where a magical fruit solves societal indifference without a visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" sequence with zero resistance; barriers like the riddle and hidden panel yield immediately without ingenuity. The climax relies on a convenient "explainer orb" that downloads the resolution, robbing the protagonist of agency and the ending of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes sequence (wanders, finds, arranges, realizes) without causal friction or necessary turns. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply decides he has found his calling, lacking an earned "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" born of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Weeks later") to resolve the central problem, bypassing the climax entirely. The inciting incident and resolution are told rather than shown, and the lack of an on-page decisive moment robs the story of causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax is driven by an accident (dropping the die) rather than a character choice, severing the causal link between agency and outcome. The closure relies on a summary explanation of the story's metaphor ("not something to capture but to let go of") rather than a dramatized shift in the narrative reality. Causality is weak, with external shifts in geometry substituting for plot progression.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where obstacles vanish via magic (the smog clears, the brush guides her hand) rather than character agency. The timeline contains a continuity slip—the moon transitions from "waxing" to "full" in a single session—and the closure is a soft thematic assertion without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a linear "and then" structure where magical objects (the lens, the honey) resolve complex social issues without causality or cost. The ending offers total, frictionless satisfaction ("spread like wildfire," "laughed"), violating the requirement for earned closure or decision. The "timeframe" setup lacks causal urgency, and the resolution is a Deus Ex Machina.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a convenient key (the yoyo) that instantly solves the central puzzle, bypassing the trial-and-error cycle required for tension. While closure occurs (time reversal), the cost is abstract and asserted ("unease," "impossible to predict") rather than a concrete price paid on the page, triggering the cost proof deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending where the conflict evaporates upon a realization, failing the requirement for a closure unit with visible or felt cost. Causality follows a dream-logic path where the environment simply fades away when the lesson is learned, removing genuine narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-causality path where the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's will without complication. Closure acts as a "soft reset," resolving the vague restlessness without the required felt or conceptual cost, failing the closure validity test.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative functions as a prologue to a larger story, ending on a sequel hook ("began her next journey") rather than a self-contained closure unit with paid cost. The climax relies on a disembodied voice delivering a substantial exposition dump to resolve the central mystery, effectively bypassing causal struggle or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where obstacles are resolved immediately by convenience (finding the ledger, the loose floorboard). The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains the goal without paying any visible or felt cost, lacking the required decisive change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path without causal friction; Elias arrives, repairs, and is rewarded with a magical light show. The closure is a "gift" ending that validates the premise without exacting a visible cost or forcing a trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "video game" logic where obstacles dissolve immediately upon contact (stamping a map moves stone walls). There is no resistance or cost; the closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" win state that requires no sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist. The premise contains a fundamental logic break: the library is "forgotten" yet Elara works there as an indexer readjusting books.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a predictable linear path where a mentor figure explains the solution, leading directly to resolution. The ending, where the island physically responds to Kael's internal state, feels like a convenient "pathetic fallacy" rather than a causal outcome of his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks causal beats, functioning instead as a static vignette of reflection without a decisive change or felt cost. The closure is a "soft reset" where a realization resolves trauma without earning it through struggle or sacrifice. The drive lens is unclear, drifting between backstory summary and abstract contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" structure (find A, find B, find C) with no Causal pressure or meaningful complications. The closure attempts a conceptual realization ("fragments of himself") but fails to land because no visible or felt cost was paid to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality is strained by the contrived nature of the driftwood; finding a piece naturally carved into a clock mechanism that fits the watch hand is a coincidence that breaks suspension of disbelief. The narrative relies on a dream-logic connection between the environment and the character's psyche that lacks grounding in the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers from a lack of causal friction; a decades-long conflict is resolved by a single metaphorical speech without leverage or sacrifice. The resolution feels unearned and tidy, lacking the requisite cost to make the closure resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a soft-reset pattern where the conflict dissolves through reflection rather than action; the protagonist simply decides to feel better. The closure—renouncing the compass—lacks felt cost because the object was already established as "mocking her," making its abandonment a relief rather than a sacrifice. Causality is weak, relying on a static sequence of thoughts to drive the change.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a passive inciting incident (the slip) and an unearned epiphany download from the cavern walls. While the sacrifice of the ball offers structural closure, the lack of causal pressure leading to the realization flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on arbitrary coincidence (a fortune cookie falling from a tree in a fantasy orchard) to advance the plot. Closure is a "Soft Reset" where the central conflict is resolved by redefining the goal (self-love) without a tangible cost or sacrifice, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative arc depends on convenient magic to resolve the central problem; the saucer simply glows and provides the necessary epiphany without the protagonist earning it. The closure is a "realization" that feels largely unearned by the prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist succeeds without obstacle or error. The resolution (stitching the air) feels unearned, relying on abstract "soft magic" mechanics that solve the problem instantly without causal setup or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies entirely on external guidance (the "whispering hush") to move the protagonist, resulting in a Deus ex machina structure where the universe literally speaks the answer. Causality is broken by the lack of protagonist agency; events happen to her, not because of her. The ending lacks closure cost; she simply receives an epiphany without sacrifice or meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies on convenient contrivances; the protagonist solves the central puzzle instantly by tracing lines with a quill holder, and the climax resolves via a "magic switch" that fixes the societal problem without cost. The ending is a "Soft Reset" where the revolution is accomplished simply by turning lights on.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.6)
    Linear, procedural plotting moves from preparation to success without complication or deviation. The ending relies on a soft "journey continues" hook and an abstract realization ("friction disappeared") rather than a decisive change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks causal friction; the protagonist’s epiphany is delivered by an external prop (the envelope) rather than earned through struggle. Closure is a "soft reset" where the character simply decides to be free without paying any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear structure, but the causality is soft; the "duel" resolves via mutual agreement and sudden epiphany rather than earned consequence. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing that "questions are answers"—feels like a soft reset that evades the stakes established by the duel.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary ("Together, they rebuilt") rather than scene, lacking causal pressure or obstacles. A severe orientation failure occurs when the setting shifts from an abandoned "rusted library" to an active "prison library" without explanation, breaking spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on a convenient Deus Ex Machina (the sudden memory of the film reel) to drive action. The closure—a realization delivered by the magic object—lacks earned causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved instantly by planting the seed. Closure fails the literary requirement for cost; the resolution is unearned, relying on a simple correct answer to a riddle to fix a catastrophic threat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic where objects unlock the path via thematic resonance ("applied the same method") rather than causal agency or mechanical logic. Closure is a soft realization ("Elias understood") that resolves the quest without a decisive change or visible cost on the page.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density and symbolic beats build to Charged Poise closure with drawer pull handoff and Kael's reserved nod as felt cost ("I do not forgive lightly"). Orientation anchored early in parapet/mist setup. Single scene causality intact, no breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: texture of compass failure, poles, waves builds density to Charged Poise closure (tucks compass, paddles with hope); cost legible in "backlash of regrets still lingered, but it no longer defined her"; single scene anchored early, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build through glow/swim to CR closure; "labyrinth wasn’t a place; it was a state of mind" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of carrying empathy "even when it hurt" legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with scent-density building to conjuring and CR closure ("weight of her past lift, replaced by... purpose"); cost legible in glowing hands and letting go. Orientation anchors Elara/orchard/moonlight by para 1; single scene causality tight, fortune cookie propelling to guardian payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; density tightens from shuffle to glowing crack visions as RR/Charged Poise, with legible cost in swirling missed moments. Orientation anchored immediately ("midnight glade above clouds"). Closure image ("no longer felt like a wound") reconfigures stake undeniably.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly beep to portal opening, stitching ruins, final awakening as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost of transformed shadows legible in spilling light. Orientation anchored early in ship/void/mission; single scene with portal shard transition fits scope; one tightening at scars prompting stitch narrows to renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build (whisper louder, bugs brighter) to CR closure at uncorking/release, legible cost in "most cherished possession" sacrificed; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → sundial investigation → key discovery → confrontation → activation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara at post, courtyard, twilight). Closure DC on-page at "cradle of sparks roared to life" with cost in implied ongoing danger as she slips away.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rock sequence to eel harmony and dust glow, yielding CR closure in realization with felt sanity/journey cost. Orientation anchored early ("tidal bluff," "Kael, eel herder"). One tightening via curse flare suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from envelope arrival to map reveal and timer silence as Resonant Reconfiguration; closure cost legible in "uncensored hands" forging future. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with debate density building to CR closure ("the destination... within him all along") with conceptual cost of foreclosed external search; Mara's hesitation provides one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure on rooftop ("this self... here to stay"); cost legible in prior moltings' impermanence foreclosed. One tightening via letters' discovery narrows to shared purpose; orientation anchored early in city/library.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with motif density (compasses, clock, film) tightening to CR closure where clock ticks and compasses still, reweighting premise with embrace-cost legible in "surprised fate... with a new song altogether."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: dream clue leads to ridge, creature confrontation tightens via riddle, planting yields DC closure as tree withstands monsoon with felt cost of preserved memory vs. dissolution risk. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening at peak suffices for scope.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from compass spinning to settling, lace whispers, cove discovery, letters dissolving in final CR with cost of release legible in "heart lighter" and objects left behind; orientation anchored early in islet details; single tightening via compass direction suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dust-borne butterfly re-images the entire greenhouse, re-weighting loss into renewal with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density increases until the final cadence shift. Causality is loose but coherent: each sprinkling beat thickens texture, not option tree. The “storm→flood→ruin” anchor is clear by line 3; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: ledger reveals apprentice alive and guild scheme, Elara crystallizes her next move, cost is the scorched kiln as evidence of mortal risk. Causal lens holds: because she decodes frost → therefore finds caches → therefore reaches kiln → therefore gains knowledge that reframes stakes. One shard transition (campfire → morning → night) is legible via frost/ledger pattern. Orientation anchored by 80-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the fork’s final vibration reframed as a brush-stroke on silence—Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (she forfeits sound forever). Causal lattice holds: Kael’s pattern → joint decoding → fork re-struck; no lucky coincidences. Orientation achieved inside 120 words; single POV stable. Minor slack: the “unshaken marvels” thesis is asserted more than dramatized until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clear: package → lens hunt → assembly → beacon, each because/therefore step legible. Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—the city’s first starlight in centuries—reweighting the premise with undeniable visual cost. One soft spot: the library’s spatial logic is sketched rather than constrained (no map, no limited air, no collapsing shelf that blocks a next move), so agency never tightens. Still, the final image reconfigures meaning and satisfies the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is linear and coherent: anonymous runs → discovery → public gathering → communal pledge. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s ring reconfigures the community’s self-image with felt cost—the exposure of Mara’s anonymity. However, the escalation is gentle; no option is foreclosed and no tangible resource is lost. The story remains a single shard; default scope met, orientation clear by line 6, lens stable.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant in Kwan Yin’s palm reimages prior guilt into forward mission, light “enveloping her” with felt warmth. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each wisteria spark adds density until the beam reweights her stance. No persistent constraint or price is shown (she keeps the pendant, no physical or social toll), so the cost is only atmospheric, not tactical. The lens holds—twilight bloom as accretive pattern—but the beat stops just short of undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze fixes its geometry and her memory sharpens, paying a conceptual price (fragment gone, self rewritten). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory swell thickens until the vortex reweights the stakes. The “ancestor slideshow” is summary, not dramatized beat, so the cost is slightly muffled, but the final image of the now-static labyrinth crystallizes the change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: arrow code → piano keys → vault → escape, each beat logically triggered by the previous. The wall-clock supplies tightening, the collapse literally chasing the protagonist up the ladder. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the chains fall, seeds saved, world tilted toward renewal; cost is the near-burial under falling concrete. One minor elasticity: the enemy footfalls arrive exactly on cue, but because they complicate rather than rescue, coincidence is allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forge reweights trust-fracture from haunting to bearable, with on-page cost—“her chest, a resonant ache.” Causal chain holds: because she collects absences → therefore forge can imprint → therefore ache becomes legible knowledge. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 3; no penalty. Single-scene default respected; no teleporting props. The final image of “monuments to resilience” reconfigures the greenhouse from mausoleum to shrine, satisfying RR.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: flower warning → retreat → bouquet challenge → panel opens → Elara reveal → jar acceptance, each because/therefore link narrows options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s stance shifts from thief to seeker with felt cost—she leaves empty-handed of theft yet carrying soul-weight. Orientation anchored by word 60 (emerald station, moonlight, clock tower). No teleporting props; jar and flowers track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked bookmark sealed in a fragile sphere reweights the premise—safe zones can only exist inside permeable, breakable vessels. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the melting ice and glass spheres tighten the stake density until the final image crystallizes the cost of abandonment-of-control. Causality is intact: because she abandons fear of cracks, she can gift the sphere. The only nit is a mild orientation lag—place and time anchors arrive ~140 words in, but the delay serves the hush of abandonment, so the Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: shell vibration → find cast → decrypt → key → mirror room → shattering reflections. Each beat narrows options; the final “You are what you choose” is a Conceptual Repricing that rewrites her rule-set. Cost is visible—the mirrors crack, foreclosing the path of endless doubling. One minor causality bump: the key’s exact prior function is elided, but it is accepted as inherited clue rather than deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the oracle freezes in a private smile while the last star dies, reweighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—silence and darkness accrue until the night becomes total. Cost is implied (the oracle stands alone in absolute dark), yet the lens is taught late and the price is off-stage rather than viscerally felt. Causality is loose—stories are recounted rather than causally linked to the oracle’s changing options—so the tightening is cadence-based, not consequential. The ending satisfies the lyric requirement but lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “a bridge, connecting it to the mundane mysticism of the universe” reweights the quest with cosmic scale and felt cost. Causal lens holds: because Unit-7 plays, therefore it sees the web—tight, single loop. Orientation is clear at line 5: frozen courtyard, twilight, robot janitor. The second-chance program’s rules, however, are introduced retroactively; the violin’s agency is never pre-established, creating a mild teleporting-prop wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: lens held to light crystallizes “something true” and reweights the cracked trust, with cost felt in the shared silence that follows. Causality is mostly accumulative: doodles → lens → offer, each beat adding density rather than forcing a because/therefore turn; the final smile is micro-turn enough for this length. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: marbles accrue symbolic weight via daily ritual; cadence shift lands in the charged poise of the final gleam at sunset with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words: Elias, garden maze, present afternoon. Closure reweights premise: cracks become beauty’s source; no outline sequencing. One transition (weeks pass) is legible and taught by ritual repetition. Cost is visible—he forecloses the fantasy of perfect restoration and accepts perpetual mending.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: each calibration step triggers the next system failure. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure unit is a Charged Poise—the nexus stabilizes but future danger is now legible, with the price of possible “rewriting physics” stated on the page. Constraint (destabilized station) shapes tactics throughout; persistent cost is the station-wide damage logged before reboot.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph (“water damage creating images”) and held to the end: the density of water-stains, lantern-flicker, and dissolving paper accruing until the final image reweights silence as gift rather than lack. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ghost vanishes, the program dissolves, Clara stands in resonance—options reconfigured without exposition. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. A −0.3 is applied because the causal chain between “humming melody” and “water ripples in time” drifts toward magical convenience rather than earned physics, slightly dulling the cost edge.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene, single-POV default met; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 50. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s Charged Poise over the smudged illustration crystallizes her new stance—truth as living distortion—and the conceptual cost (permanent uncertainty) is legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the blurring flower, station creaks, and ozone scent thicken until the final image reweights stakes; no meaningful tightening beyond the final cadence shift, so just short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene causal chain (tunnel → wheel → machine → release) is legible and lands a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the ghost shift ends. Orientation is immediate; no seam artifacts. The “hush after confession” motivator is named but not dramatized on-page, so the pivot into action is slightly under-motivated. Closure beat is present and lens-consistent, but the price is external (ghosts freed) rather than internal, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian mirror dissolves the refuge, rewrites her journals, and reweights her vocation to “preserve” silence itself; the cost is legible in the erased building and the pages she no longer remembers writing. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each image (swan, catacombs, mirror) layers density until the final silence crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: eclipse cadence thickens atmosphere, curl reframes light. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Finn’s wonder crystallized—but the cost accrues solely to the boy; Elara’s options are never narrowed, so the reconfiguration is one-sided. Because the protagonist’s causal chain is static, the resonance feels borrowed rather than earned. Still, the final image cleanly reweights the curl’s meaning under the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causal chain is legible: diaries → scrolls → ritual → dream-restoration, but causality is front-loaded; the climax is a single declarative beat (“the displaced axis began to shift”) that summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn. Closure is present as Charged Poise—golden light suffusing the silo—but the cost is off-page; the reader is told the world dreams again, not shown a concrete price Elara pays. The lens is Causal; it holds, yet the final linkage is compressed into two sentences, muting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a declared decision (“began to plan”) rather than a visible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; cost is off-page. Causal chain: find specs → feel power → decide to leave is thin; lighthouse dreams are never linked to specs by concrete beat. Orientation holds, but the plot never tightens—options do not narrow, stakes do not re-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence and rhetorical questions layer density until a conceptual re-pricing (“the unraveled stillness is clarity”) dissolves the possession. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; however, the text never converts static ritual into a tightening beat that forecloses an option. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is purely abstract—no visible price is paid by the priest, so the effect feels observational rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline harp sounds, the horizon mirror holds, and the cost is the writer’s collapse—an image that reweights the premise. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and paid off, but the middle beat of “whispering into the shell → harp vibrates” is a soft causal leap that keeps this shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: labyrinth reframed from conquest to acceptance, with faint cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fractal selves deepens until stance crystallizes; causality is loose but coherent. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no penalty. However, escalation is a single cadence shift rather than progressive tightening; one deepening suffices for band but keeps score sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear and the unheard drumbeat crystallize a before/after with felt cost. Causal lens holds: because she fractures the needle → therefore she reverses music → therefore feeling returns. Orientation is clean at word 60; cavern, season, deafness anchored early. One soft causality gap: the legend of backward songs is asserted, not earlier seeded, so the method feels imported rather than earned from prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: because he finds the tube, therefore he breaches the zone; because he learns the storms are artificial, therefore he accepts public responsibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—courtyard tranquil yet freighted—cost legible in “his life would never be the same.” One tight spiral of escalation; no teleporting props. The follower set-up is dropped, a minor ellipsis that does not break the because-chain but slightly thins persistent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the uncorking reconfigures Elias’s stance toward grief and the lanterns soften, a resonant reweighting with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the vial’s mechanics are never motivated, so the hospital-greenhouse hops read like magical set-pieces rather than因果 tightening. Orientation is clear by word 60, well within waiver. The single micro-turn (hesitate → uncork) is sufficient for this length, but the escalation is spectral, not tactical, keeping the lens at Accumulative/Textural. Cost is legible in the final image: “the lanterns themselves were comforting him,” a conceptual repricing that makes the shop’s warmth newly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (rope ↔ wall grooves ↔ star constellations) tightens until the mirror reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: options crystallize across three mirror-images, cost felt in the surrendered rope and the undiminished solitude. Orientation clean by line 4; no teleporting props. The “ethically playful” idea of time-as-poem is taught early and paid off in the final line without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene orientation is secure by ~120 words; the chronic hush → bowl → music chain supplies a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens that holds to the Charged Poise ending, yet the causal link between “playing to the hush” and the land’s exhalation is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels ambient rather than personally levied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: joy is now transiently attainable yet remains half-true, reweighting Kael’s emotional rule-set. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber warmth deepens, petal dissolves, cadence shifts to softer acceptance. Orientation is secure by word 80; causal chain is thin but coherent under lyric escalation. Final image carries felt cost—“quiet satisfaction” tinged with unspoken loneliness—so earns Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is gentle but intact: mis-addressed letter → curiosity → correspondence → meeting. Closure is a soft Charged Poise—Elara feels the locket “lighter,” implying cycle completion—but no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. Orientation is clear within 120 words; single transition to library is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage holds: because the sea swallowed her marsh, Lira seeks kinship; because she finds Echo’s tag, she interrogates the orchard; because she shares others’ stories, they accept her—each beat narrows options until the final tag reconfigures belonging. Orientation anchors by line 4 (crystalline orchard, crater edge, present evening) and Echo’s tag is taught early as inciting invitation. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the arbor’s shifting patterns crystallize with Echo’s new tag on her sculpture, making the cost of her search felt without exposition. One minor scaffold: “Weeks turned into months” is efficient, but the montage could have shown one concrete setback to raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant quiets, she sketches under stars, cadence restored—cost is the inability to keep the Heart. Causality is soft: the canal reshapes itself “as if” obeying her, not because of a rule we were taught. Still, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: the repeated infinity pulses tighten texture until the final image reweights time as tapestry, not river.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.7)
    Causal chain is present but slack: discovery of eyes → code → journal → breakthrough arrives through effortless magical scans rather than escalating obstacles. The mentor’s warning is the only cost, yet Elara never faces a concrete consequence for ignoring it. Closure is a declaration of harmony, not a visible change of stance or forfeiture. Orientation is clear, but the lens drifts from mystery to lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing (visibility = being heard) but arrives via passive accumulation, not causally driven beat; orientation anchor ("who") surfaces ~135 words in—just past the safe window—and the deliberate anonymity creates mild chronic disorientation that is never exploited by the ending; one shard, no reversal, so "meaningful tightening" is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is accumulative/textural: leaf-touch → rain cadence → pot-shuffling density tightens until the final charged poise. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the vanished leaf and sun-shaft re-weight “control” to “surrender” with conceptual cost. No causal break; escalation is pattern-deepening, not reversal, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: rain-trail → ruin → brooch → map → cove → exchange holds without breaks; orientation is clear by ~100 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she paints, now weighted as “bridge between worlds,” with conceptual cost legible. Escalation is single-cycle; no tightening fork or visible forfeiture keeps it from 9-band. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens: touch-pearl → merge → guardian renunciation is legible and complete. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Closure is Charged Poise: “silent promise” reconfigures her future with undeniable conceptual cost. However, the decisive change is floated rather than punched—no single sentence crystallizes the price she will now pay (loss of human form? solitude?); reader must infer.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain intact: valve hum → note → woman appears → inheritance of role. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s “absences” are re-valued into fillable spaces. Cost is felt—she forfeits outsider safety and accepts an endless task. One transition (cliff ascent) is crisp; orientation anchored by word 84.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: punch → arrows → gates → blank ticket → punch, each step a because/therefore that narrows her option to ‘map’ toward ‘embrace un-mappable.’ The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the ticket’s emptiness reweights all prior mapped routes as obsolete. Cost is legible in the final image—she stands ticketed but destination-less—but the price is still more conceptual than corporeal, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile dissolves into starlight and Elara’s worldview is quietly repriced—she will listen annually to an “unheard symphony.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each tile glow and number shift intensifies pattern density until the final cadence reweights her purpose. Cost is conceptual yet legible—her skepticism is not refuted but made porous, foreclosing the old aloof stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is present—boredom → find fragment → experiment → shatter → new purpose—but the fragment’s rules and the spatial-mutiny stakes are retroactively explained rather than foreshadowed, so the climax feels convenient. Closure lands as Charged Poise (“spark of purpose” image) with conceptual cost, satisfying the lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara reweights the rule-set by naming honesty as non-negotiable, father’s hand offers an uncertain truce—cost is the loss of escape via asylum. Causal chain holds: ink-pot oddity → interior crack open → naming the lie → stalemate with felt future risk. Orientation is clean within 120 words. Minor slack: “political asylum” is declared stakes but never tested in a concrete obstacle beat; the tightening is emotional, not external, yet still sufficient under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the forest “whispers approval” and Elara descends with the new history inside the satchel; the cost is conceptual (she now carries an unshareable burden) and is legible. Causality is thin—why tonight’s hum spikes is unexplained—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern holds, but the tightening beat is external (the hum coalesces) rather than a decision she forces.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged fragment adds density until the archive container reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—”the texture of memories was… the act of remembering”—but the cost is more asserted than felt; no prior option is visibly closed off. Tides and label appear early, satisfying orientation; causality between items is associative rather than consequential. One meaningful tightening occurs, yet the escalation is poetic accretion, not narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass rule-set flips from artifact to stance, cost felt in the bittersweet smile and live silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return—wind through dome, shell glow, cello hum—adds density until the final cadence reweights impermanence as power. The persistent constraint (“myth buster” tools useless here) shapes tactics and is paid in the forfeiture of proof. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: chip → graffiti trail → festival rally → symbolic placement. Closure lands as Charged Poise (stone at festival center reweights communal identity) with felt conceptual cost (gentrification still looms). However, escalation is front-loaded; middle beats repeat “she found more graffiti” without tightening options. Orientation is clean; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is lean: chemical message → decode → stay to dawn → final shot. Orientation is clear by line 5; no spatial drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she forecloses retreat, sand grain in fist, sunrise on metal—cost is imaged, not exposited. The beat would sharpen if the chemical trigger altered her tactics mid-documentation rather than merely confirming what she already wants.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the drone lives, the ship sails, Elara stays—anchor metaphor re-weighted without sermonizing. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory patch adds tonal density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is conceptual but legible: she foregoes the voyage to remain the depot’s unseen anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands cleanly: the stream beneath the ice physically reweights her quest, offering Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality, however, slackens: the thinning ice and rising mist appear as fortunate signs rather than consequences of her agency, so the “because/therefore” engine never tightens. Orientation is solid—anchors arrive well inside the 120-word window—yet the lens ambiguity between situational omen-reading and causal investigation keeps the plot from locking into high-band precision.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural design is legible—each footstep adds density until the bell rings—but the promised “shared balance” is asserted, not dramatized; no on-page cost is exacted from Elias, so the closure is a pleasing image rather than a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is one-way (Elias acts, town revives) without tightening or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    Causal chain is present—cave-in → vial → memories → exit—but the decisive change (she simply walks out) is elided; we never see the mechanism that re-opens the temple, so cost is asserted, not felt. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Lens holds as causal, yet the magical escape hatch is a late, un-telegraphed rule change. Closure image is pretty but does not reweight prior stakes because the life-or-death pressure has already been defused.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias rejects the ancestral silence and claims a new identity, visible in the final hover. Causal chain is thin—journal discovery alone pivots motive—so the price feels conceptual rather than earned through escalating beats; still, the lens (Causal) holds and orientation is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise—the bead’s glow and the chorus of whispers reconfigure her solitary debt into a collective one—yet the cost is asserted, not shown: no option is visibly closed off, no price exacted on the page. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); the bead’s awakening simply “comes at a cost,” but the causal chain between clutching it and the new communal burden is implied, not dramatized. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the midpoint reflective block (≈30% of text) pauses present pressure, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: overlapping sleepwalking paths tighten into a cadence shift rather than causal reversals, and the final gallery glow is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (her exhaustion, the irreversible fusion of plate and stone). Orientation is taught early (“centuries-old labyrinth”, “tide pools emptied”), so the later lyric compression is legible. Closure lands cleanly, though the absence of a micro-turn keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural re-weights Elara’s exile into cyclical continuity, cost felt in the phrase “she had come here broken.” Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed shard thickens texture until the final image crystallizes meaning. However, the middle compresses time into montage (“days turned into weeks”), skipping beats where the land could have refused or punished her, softening pressure. Orientation is clear by 60 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal lens holds: chalk coordinates → mailbox → letter → call-to-action chain is legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn light reconfigures Lyra’s stance, cost felt in “echoes of the past remained.” The mailbox beat lands on-page, but the letter’s “masterpiece” content is summarized, blunting the decisive change punch. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 6; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene causal chain holds: flame pulses → chart shifts → Lira arrives → they synchronize → dawn chart finished. Orientation anchored by 120 words (dome, cushion, eternal candle). Closure is Conceptual Repricing—chart path reweights the coup from political to cosmic—but the cost is conceptual, not visceral; no constraint or price lingers in the final image. Mentor-vanish info is withheld beyond Elara’s knowledge, so no retro-omniscience break.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each apparition in condensation adds density until the final map/letter reweights Elara’s stance. Orientation is swift—mangrove labyrinth, night, moonlight—inside 50 words. Causality is preserved: shard-touch → message → map → personal letter → renunciation of silence. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the singing spirits drop to one clear note, the shard dims, Elara “felt whole,” a reconfiguration of prior guilt into forward motion; cost is the irrevocable exposure of her own unspoken regret.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coral’s steady glow and the imperative “Tell them the ocean still sings” reconfigure her private grief into public voice—cost is felt if not yet paid. Causal chain holds—each deciphered line narrows her moral option space toward action. Orientation is swift: “mist-clad atrium at twilight” anchors who/where/when within 30 words. One shard only, no transition, so default scope met; no amnesia or prop teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: fresco fragment → exposed film → knowledge network → fog-canvas. Each step is contiguous and the final image of glowing fog delivers visible cost (she foregoes walls forever). Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Yet escalation is gentle—one deepening, not a narrowing—so closure feels more resonant than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mural’s awakening and the coin-figure’s step-out create a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her prior certainty. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore; the garden’s hum and her harmonic response accumulate until the final image crystallizes meaning. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate disorientation (shifting mural, talking coin) pays off in the charged final image. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; the “cage” of certainty is named, yet we do not feel its bars snap, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is present—Elias leaves with seed + new intel, Lexicon now actively fighting back—so one Decisive Change qualifies. Causality is episodic: panel test → seed reveal → meet-up, each step permitted by off-stage planners rather than protagonist initiative. Seed-decoding carries no visible failure risk or resource cost, so tension is prospective, not on-page. Orientation is clean within 120 words and world-rules are self-consistent; thus modest but functional plot integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the shell accumulates her songs until a cadence shift in the final lullaby. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shell “exhales” and the stars “wink”—but the cost is only asserted, not felt; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on-page. Orientation is clear early, yet causality is circular: each week folds into the next without tightening stakes. The poem’s completion changes nothing we can point to; the armistice remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain is loose: “felt a pull” is the only trigger for the entire quest; no intermediate because/therefore links escalate risk. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the museum threshold appears as a teleport rather than a consequence. Closure is Charged Poise (light bloom, names etched deeper) and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the cost is abstract—no persistent constraint shapes future action. The shattering chime is pretty but functions as symbol, not causal price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: broken promise → inkwell quest → apology draft → restored trust. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the path of silence, cost shown in “her heart light for the first time in months.” Orientation anchored by 120-word mark via archive geography + sunlight beams. No teleporting props; inkwell hum cues magic rule early.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal spine holds: adhesive analysis → poem-chain → floodgate blueprint → compromise. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis—Elias “had trembled, but he had not broken”—with social cost legible in the village’s sigh and scholars’ nod. Orientation is clean by word 80; the volcano’s breathing is taught early and pays off in the final cadence. One paraphrase loop (“closer to the heart…closer to the truth”) keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s final acceptance of the “symphony” reconfigures her stance, but the cost is only lyrical assertion (“she had preserved herself”) with no tangible loss or new constraint. Causality is soft: the anonymous letter triggers recognition, yet the dust-mote “map” is interpreted instantaneously without trial-and-error, false leads, or risk, weakening the because/therefore chain. The story obeys single-scene default and orients early (attic, skylight, pigeon coop by ~80 words), so no orientation penalty applies. Overall, a graceful accumulative arc, but the pivotal causal leap is under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drifting-prism terrace supplies an accumulative lens: each chromatic shift layers the central stake of “necessary distances.” Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing—leaving the logbook reframes every prior threshold as a sacrificial distance—felt cost is legible in the final image. One soft causality gap: the unseen code she “couldn’t yet decipher” triggers the insight anyway; the leap is lyrical, not motivated. Orientation is clean by word 80; pattern of light-fold disorientation is taught early and repaid at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: firefly pattern thickens until it reweights belonging. One clean transition (alarm → pod → dance) keeps orientation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she abandons the drowned city but carries its rhythm—cost visible in cracked glass and sunrise. Tightening beat could sharpen earlier domino links; still, image reconfiguration with felt cost satisfies 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each seed-and-glass attempt layers texture until the remembered path appears, then flickers out—an earned stasis. Orientation is quick and spatially vivid (“cross-legged on a smooth, glowing surface”). Causality is associative rather than because/therefore, acceptable under the lens; the final image reweights prior attempts with conceptual cost (“some paths disappear…to be rediscovered”). Closure lands cleanly, though the price is felt intellectually, not through lost option or prop.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    A single shard under the skylight works as situational pressure; the bishop’s alignment with real-time crowd movement supplies the “because/therefore” linkage that tightens options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the beam-cast shadow reconfigures the crowd’s awe and Elias’s stance—yet the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, leaving stakes slightly abstract. Orientation is clean; lens holds. The story’s logic never breaks, but the absence of a persistent constraint on Elias caps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of gaps, dust, starlight builds density toward the arm-offering image. Anchors who/where/when secured by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sentinel pausing plus verse glowing reweights options with undeniable social cost. Cost is conceptual but legible in the sentinel’s retreat and garden’s exhale; persistent constraint (ban) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: dawn → prism ritual → pond ripples → atrium hum → decision forms a tidy intensifying pattern, and the final “he would share” functions as Charged Poise that re-weights his role. However, the resolution is announced, not embodied; no object is surrendered, no social risk shown, so the cost is intellectual, not felt—capping the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box left glowing on the ridge reweights guilt into communal bearing. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each feather flash thickens the textual density rather than altering external options. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the box’s cracks glow—an imago that crystallizes the new stance. Cost is conceptual (perpetual carrying of sorrow) rather than felt on the page; hence the 0.4 gap from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the gauge’s repurposing as “reminder of journey” is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise from measurement to lived pattern. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-driven; the tide’s erasure is the single tightening that forces the shift to impermanence. No orientation debt; lens holds. Cost is felt in the final image—“she smiled” while patterns wash away—though a hairline more body-level price could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror reweights her mission from mapping to remembrance, with the film strip and diaries acting as charged objects. Causality is accumulative rather than sharply reversed; the lens holds as lyrical density re-weights stakes. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~120 words. No teleporting props; each discovery (ivy passage→fireplace→mirror) is spatially tracked and动机-linked to her perceptual trait.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrors’ permanent shift from reflection to possibility reweights the world-rule with felt cost—Elara’s fading pulse. Causal chain is lyric but intact: each lullaby note escalates resistance → surrender. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: color density and cadence tighten until the bell-toll pattern-break; cost is visible in “her own heartbeat now fainter.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the signed treaty is the visible cost, Elara’s loosened grip the emotional one. Causal linkage is loose—leaders shift because of a speech, not because the clipboard or terrace forces a tactic—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One soft spot: the “price of redemption” is named repeatedly yet never materializes as a concrete forfeiture on the page; that caps the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rain starts the moment the egg is covered, reframing her lifetime of water theft into a seed of restitution; cost is legible as the rain that once made her rich now erodes her control. Causal chain is light—map cracks → damp spot → burial—but coherent under Situational lens; no reversals or tightening mid-text, only steady approach. Orientation is clean within 50 words. No lens ambiguity. Still, escalation is flat; the beat structure is arrival→placement→weather shift, so pressure never spikes before release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: each untangling step loosens the lattice and literally opens the door; the final dance releases the echoes, producing a legible before/after for the city. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard now “hums with potential,” a crystallized image that reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual—she will “never be the same courtesan”—but no persistent constraint or price is shown on-page; the smile feels lightly won. Orientation is clear within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to “rebuild” reweights the narrative premise and carries conceptual cost—he forfeits the thrill of subversion. Causal chain is interior and accumulative; each groove-touch on the stick thickens texture rather than forcing external turns, coherent under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by word 60. No meaningful tightening beyond the single reversal; stakes stay abstract (“boundaries of ethical storytelling”) so escalation feels gentle, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added natural fragment thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the absence of monarchs. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spiral plus saved wing—whose conceptual cost (extinction, memory as fragile architecture) is legible. No meaningful tightening inside the beat sequence; the story accretes rather than pivots, satisfying the single-scene default but lacking a visible price exacted from Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery of card → re-braid rope → illumination → aurora flare, each step a because/therefore pivot. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rope and rising melody reconfigure meaning while the “spark of hope” cost is felt, not declared. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The only bar to 9+ is that the final cost is atmospheric rather than a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the dissolved wafer seal reconfigures the central question—paths choose walkers through resonance—so we get a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (the seal’s loss). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each dream-batch adds density until the pattern breaks at the storm’s peak. The orientation waiver applies; deliberate disorientation (hidden bunker, shifting glyphs) pays off in the final image. One causality quibble: the directive’s rules are never tested in a way that could fail, so the tightening is more revelation than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    Causal chain is loose: finding the compartment relies on chance finger-brush, tile decryption is narrated summary, final covenant is assertion minus dramatized beat. Orientation is clear early, but escalation stays flat—no narrowing options or rising price—so lens feels Accumulative-yet-static. Closure offers Charged Poise (“stood…ready to seal”) but cost is only rhetorical; no constraint or sacrifice appears on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s whispered “How do I start?” crystallizes options with felt social cost—he surrenders the armor of anger. Causal chain is thin—cellular memory functions as off-page magic—but the sanctuary’s rule (reappears when needed) is taught early and pays off in the final image of shifting grace. One soft reset: Kael’s flashback peace is narrated, not tested under pressure, blunting escalation. Otherwise the single-scene arc tightens cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sextant’s arrival supplies the causal hinge: because it arrives, therefore Elara acts, therefore the fog thins—an unbroken chain. Orientation is secured within 40 words (“ruined orchard district…workshop”), well under the 120-word safe zone. One soft spot: the wanderer’s exposition (“It’s said…”) momentarily tells the myth rather than staging discovery, but the lore immediately becomes material for Elara’s breath-sync experiment, so causality re-locks. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the boundary dissolves only while she breathes with the cosmos, making the cost legible—she must sustain that impossible rhythm to keep the gate open.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s glow reweights the deciduous premise, proving breakage can be generative. Causal chain holds—key unlocks scroll, petals signal soil, compass points to ribbon; each gadget earned earlier. One soft spot: the “breach” itself is summarized off-stage, so the inciting rupture never carries visceral cost. Nevertheless, the final image of the living cathedral carries undeniable social cost—nature and culture re-wed, vows now seasonal rather than perpetual.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cameo re-weights Elara’s mission from cataloguing to “unravelling,” with conceptual cost—she now shoulders an unending, nonlinear legacy. Causality is situational rather than sequential; orchard and keeper pressure crystallizes her stance, satisfying the lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is cleanly taught within 120 words. No artifact obscures the final image, but the keeper’s late entrance and instant exposition is a soft coincidence that slightly blunts the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is legible: diary → chrono-blossom → doorway → bargain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s linguistic trade re-weights access to reality-altering knowledge. Cost is present but abstract (“balance of time”)—not viscerally felt—so barely passes 9+ cost proof. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by word 50; no penalty. One shard, single POV, defaults met.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mood thickens via repeating fog/rust/decay imagery, cadence deepens when diaries weave in, and the final Charged Poise (mist-door) reweights stakes. But causal logic is thin—why does reading pages retrieve Elara’s lost piece?—and the cost is only asserted (“she felt whole”). Orientation clear; one soft transition from deck to diary room; closure lands, yet lacks felt price. One tightening beat is present but not decisive enough for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clean: seal pattern → rope re-braid → door opens → archive revealed. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the tower’s chimes recalibrated, history now speakable), satisfying the lens. However, the 120-word orientation anchor is soft—”the heart of the university” is generic—and the rope’s braiding rules are taught only at the moment of use, not earlier, so causality feels retrofitted rather than foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-scene causal chain—cracks → path → seed → song—holds; orientation (who/where) is clear by line 5. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bloom unfurls, storm abates, silence ripples out; the cost (Lira’s weariness) is asserted, not felt. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the echo stone is helper, not hindrance. Meets 600-word default; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each star alignment tightens the “because” chain toward the memory sacrifice. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—prism restored, Elara’s past deleted, melody affirming pattern-in-chaos—cost is unmistakable (“memories began to fade”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words. No teleporting props or soft resets; the shard’s rule is seeded early and paid off at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each monument & fog shard layers density rather than strict cause-effect. Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn-lit forecourt reconfigures her task from discovery to perpetual vigil, cost legible in “deepening hush.” Orientation clean within 120 wds; pattern taught early. One minor soft reset: fog visions flood then leave her upright with no physical toll—slight cost fade at apex beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new fire-image layers luminescence onto the fortress until the mosaic sun refracts the same light back. Closure is a legit Resonant Reconfiguration—the glowing mosaic re-prices the setting from ruin to beacon—but the cost is borne by anonymous spectators, not the protagonist. Causality between chant-rhythm and ignition is asserted, not shown; the rag never endangers her plan or limits options. Still, the final image cleanly crystallizes the before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cicada reweights time from mystery to lived companion, cost felt in her renunciation of linear chronicling. Causality isAccumulative/Textural—strata of moments stack until pattern breaks in the humming cicada; one tightening suffices. Orientation clean by line 3, no lens drift. The price is oblique—“ready to share its secrets”—so the RR is resonant but not gut-punch; hence 7 not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece builds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each hush-drenched locale adds density until the final crystalline stillness reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial’s perfect clarity and Mira’s lighter step together reconfigure meaning without verbal summation, cost legible in the “inner light” glow Elias now guards alone. The pattern is taught early (storm-glass reactions) and paid off in the last image; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: the quiet sectors could sharpen into one forfeited option (time, fuel, social risk) to push this into 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: mural reveals → flake confirms → staircase opens → throne rejects singular claim. Orientation anchored by word 30; no spatial drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the throne dissolves into collective wisdom—visible cost signaled by blinding starlight that forces Lira’s retreat. One mechanism glitch: the mural sequence is learned off-stage, not dramatized, but payoff still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ring cracks, a scar-link severs, and Lira assumes Charged Poise under starlight—cost is legible. Causal chain holds: darkness presses → scar-network feeds energy → ring pays price → threshold stabilizes. Accumulative lens is taught early (each scar as tether) and held to the final image. A micro-drag in mid-text—“she could feel it pressing… a suffocating presence”—slows the because/therefore momentum by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt re-weights her past “pressure” into literal diamonds, cost legible in the final image of a gleaming, purposeful bolt. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—because she inserts the bolt, therefore diamonds—but the portal jump is unmotivated by any prior failure or stakes; it simply answers a text. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty applied. One causal tightening suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is thin: turn crank → hallucinated bridge → receive journal; no intermediate obstacle or micro-choice that costs her anything. The journal’s reveal is pure gift, not consequence of her agency. Closure image (keeper by window) lands as Charged Poise, but because the lens is situational/psychic, the missing causal tightening is forgivable; still, the cost is only implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the program dissolves into the orchard, Alaric stands taller, and possibility itself is repriced. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density peaks as vine-light and ink fuse; causality is maintained within this lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, color matches, and letter fragments layer until meaning re-weights. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s smile and the shimmering dust crystallize her new purpose with conceptual cost (she will spend nights on strangers’ archives instead of her own healing). Causality is soft—dust footprints are coincidence that complicates, not resolves—but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image, satisfying the Accumulative test. Orientation is clean by word 60; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: puddle-map → lagoon dive → key-in-door → broadcast → escape, tightening options each beat. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the citywide data-dump reweights the rule-set with undeniable social cost—satisfying Q2’s cost test. Orientation is clean by 80 words; only minor elasticity is the off-stage enforcers whose arrival is heard, not seen, a permissible compression.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each musical phrase thickens atmosphere until the prophecy dissolves. One meaningful cadence shift occurs—the prism’s beam locking on him—but the causal engine is weak: grotto response is external magic, not because/therefore from his tactic. Closure is a serene tableau, not a charged poise; cost is aesthetic, not personal. Still, pattern is legible and ends with before/after glow.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the speck’s glow reconfigures her identity from sorter to “guardian” with conceptual cost, and the Accumulative lens holds—each monument beat thickens density until the final image crystallizes. Causality stays loose (the speck “chooses” her), but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last lit circle, so the lens ambiguity cap is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage is light—events accrue by mysterious beckoning rather than because/therefore—but the Accumulative/Textural pattern is taught early (swirling leaves, spinning needle) and pays off in the final image of stillness. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map returned, the compass quiet, the tinkerer’s stance reconfigured with the conceptual cost of surrendering precision. One transition (door → staircase) is clean; orientation is anchored by 120 words. No meaningful constraint or price recurs to shape tactics, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (rain → foundry → coin → furnace) and holds it to a Charged Poise close, so closure is formally valid. Yet the decisive reconfiguration—coin’s face locking to her sign—lands in a single sentence with no prior foreshadowing of that mechanic, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral; the pattern builds atmosphere but doesn’t tighten options. Because the visions are delivered as bundled parables, causality slips into montage, weakening the required “because” linkage to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: because the harp extracts memory, therefore the father releases grief, therefore Elara claims the spent talisman. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the gorge fills with faint laughter, re-weighting every prior echo—so cost is felt even though no bone breaks. Orientation is clear by line 40; only nit is that the “hidden sunrise” never tightens clock or tactic, so time pressure stays atmospheric, not causal. Still, the lens stays clean and the ending image reconfigures stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the strap’s splash is a CR image that reweights the premise—pain stays, but purpose is re-priced. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the forest’s intensifying glow substitutes for escalating stakes, satisfying the lens. Time and space anchor within 120 words; orientation test waived because disorientation pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (market, painting, tower) layers density rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors who/where by word 70; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lens fragment’s glow extinguishes, reweighting the stake from search to stewardship; cost is conceptual (stories now live in her, responsibility perpetual). No teleporting props; map reveal is seeded by spiral symbol. One cap: the tower arrival is summarized not dramatized, softening the final tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: ghost whisper → find barrel → dust pattern → ceiling clock → insert → heal cracks. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking clock re-weights the stake (“counting down to a future he couldn’t yet see”) with felt cost. No Orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One micro-turn (ceiling becomes live clock) suffices for this length. No lens ambiguity; drive stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library is revealed as living and Elara as its caretaker, a reweighting that carries conceptual cost. The causal chain, however, is loose—why the rupture appears, why she alone is chosen, why falling equals initiation is asserted, not earned. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the rupture’s appearance and the cloud-sea rules are never constrained by prior cues, so the lens feels Accumulative rather than Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram etched on the shard reweights her theory and social position. Causal chain holds—storm → shard ritual → data → concession—without convenient amnesia. Cost is legible: “tears…of burnished sorrow” and lingering personal wounds. One scaffold clause (“She knew the shard was more than a trinket…”) is redundant, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip’s glow extinguishes, light returns, and the Covenant’s rust recedes—visible change with conceptual cost (“magic spent”). Causality holds under Causal lens: each turn (unwind tether → map appears; free box → light released) is because/therefore. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The riddle’s half-truth is never paid back as a causal twist, so the emotional cost is more symbolic than personal; keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer deepens mood but the escalation is atmospheric, not causal; closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing lagoon re-weights mystery over possession—yet no persistent price is nailed to Elara on-page. Compass loss is symbolic, not a constraint that shapes future tactics. Causality stays loose: "because/therefore" between beats is mostly thematic parallelism, not option-narrowing. Orientation is clean by line 4, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: slide discovery → compulsion → arch passage → paired-slide epiphany → custodian vow, each beat a therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (storm-arch); closure lands with conceptual repricing (map of ideas) and visible cost—Mara forfeits sole authorship to become conduit. One minor lapse: the GPS failure is mentioned after the fact, not shown constraining initial navigation, blunting the stakes beat fractionally.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal spine holds: dream → postcards → journey → mural; each beat follows because/therefore logic and the closure image (completed canvas as “testament”) delivers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she can now “see” beauty in darkness. Orientation is secure by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The tightening is singular rather than escalating, so the plot never risks a real fork; still, the through-line is clean and the final beat reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: lagoon entity nods, waters still, Elara senses “the sands holding breath,” reconfiguring meaning with felt敬畏. Causal chain is thin—entity appears because shells are arranged, a quasi-magical handshake that skirts protagonist-driven cost. Orientation clear by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation rather than because-therefore drives the piece, lens held. Non-closure accumulation: one soft reset—diary weight declared heavy yet never constraints tactics—caps Q2 at 8.0, so 7.4 remains.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: lantern-by-lantern glow and rebuilding density reweight the stake. Orientation is crisp—who, where, when land in the first 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lanterns keep glowing after Elara leaves, a visible reconfiguration that carries conceptual cost (she forfeits belonging). One soft spot: the wish-granting mechanism is abstract; the bottle’s rules are never tested or constrained, so the resurrection feels mildly convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the garden’s exhale and warmer air reconfigure the stakes without tidy resolution, cost felt in the silence that follows her words. Causality under an Accumulative lens holds: the silent foghorn → shaving → symbols → soil memory chain never breaks. The third-grade memory is seeded early and paid off at the phonograph beat, satisfying mosaic track rules. Only the somewhat generic “archive emotional patterns” refrain keeps it from the 9-band—it’s told, not turned into a constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise—“she was ready to embrace it”—but the cost is only asserted; nothing is foreclosed on the page. The vortex mechanics are never constrained; reversing entropy is named, not demonstrated, so the decisive change floats free of causality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s toll reframes Elias from technician to keeper, cost legible in the rain’s harmony. Causal chain holds—microclimate cue → rope tug → bell answer—though the rope’s rule-set arrives late. Orientation anchor is met by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One tightening only, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: lantern dimmed, Lira grounded, cost legible in her changed stance. Causal chain is soft—lantern activates station, she follows coordinates, insight arrives without resistance or trade-off—so escalation feels accumulative/textural rather than driven. Orientation is swift; no lens contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a luminous Earned Stasis: the ghosts dissolve, the oasis stirs, Elias’s guardian identity crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each fragment he gathers (symbol, melody, water) layers density until the final song releases the covenant’s weight. Orientation anchors within 120 words, no lens ambiguity. The stained-glass box reappears in the last line, charging the image with prior pattern—meets 9+ test for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is legible: broken capsule → fragment → Thaddeus → weaver → fix. One meaningful tightening occurs when the urn fragment guides them to the hidden chamber, narrowing options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with faint conceptual cost—time regains rhythm and Elara gains purpose—yet the cost is reported (“she felt”) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity; structure is default single-scene with accumulative texture, pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing kite-poem reconfigures meaning and the feather transferred is a visible constraint that shapes the final image—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality, however, is loose; the cut string arrives by coincidence and the kite’s magical text is an unexplained rule drift. Orientation is clear by line 6, but the ‘burnished hush’ lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than Situational, and the pattern is not taught early enough to feel inevitable. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying escalation under Accumulative rules, so the score clears the 6.8 bar but misses 7+ because the kite’s agency supersedes character causality.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each copper-wrapped branch adds visual density and pattern recognition that culminates in the glowing pillars. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias’s earned stasis beneath the oak—where the reconfigured orchard is left as gift, cost legible in “not mine to keep.” Orientation is clean; stakes tighten once when copper reveals hollow carved pillars, foreclosing pure horticulture and forcing architectural guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber pieces, tower layers, and converging footprints build density toward the charged merger at the pedestal. Orientation is clean by word 80; no causality breaks. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—map inside amber re-weights “homecoming” with conceptual cost—though the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a soft-edged Charged Poise: garden may spread, cost is only hoped-for. Causality is weak; birds’ “map” is ornamental, never tested or failed. No tightening narrows options; stakes declared but never challenged on page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: leaf → factory → phonograph → perceptual shift, each beat because-of-the-last. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—distance collapses into closeness—yet the cost is only asserted (“we’re not as far apart as we think”) rather than felt; no concrete option is foreclosed. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; single-scene default met. Lens holds, but the final image lacks a persistent constraint or price that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: spire ascent → chess trial → lid revelation → sky healed. The pivot that the lid is “not a tool to amend the sky, but a key” lands as a Conceptual Repricing with light cost (trembling hands), satisfying closure. Orientation is swift; no prop or rule breaks. Escalation is linear rather than tightening; options never narrow, they simply unlock, so pressure feels accumulative, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the gallery’s echoes, the absent pawns, and the word-path layer density until “forgiveness” and “belonging” re-weight Elara’s self-concept. The closure is a Charged Poise: the whispers modulate from past-echo to future-promise while Elara stands in “luminous absence,” a felt reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who/where/when inside 120 w), the single shard holds, and the cost—her acknowledgement of avoided pain—is legible. One minor drag: the chessboard’s agency is asserted more than exercised, so the symbolic constraint doesn’t tighten tactics; still, the pattern holds and the resonance lands.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bookstore circle and floating stone reweight “home” from place to portable state of being, with felt emotional cost in the storm-release. Causality is light—stone’s glow is magical rather than earned—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery (feather/stone/mercury-glass) accretes to shift meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 3. The ending beat is legible and charged, satisfying the 9− gate even though agency is mostly interpretive.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal line holds: frayed tapestry → decoding → labyrinth passage → thread message → self-reconciliation. Closure (“Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey”) lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting guilt into ongoing process; tear and “quiet resolve” show felt cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 3; no penalty. Drive lens is Causal; each beat is motivated by prior discovery. Minor weakness: labyrinth invitation reads slightly convenient—no prior obstacle or price paid to enter, muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the path appears, cost is felt (she walks “alone, but unburdened”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each poetic fragment refracts the mist and reweights the stake. The 120-word anchor is met; canyon, spire, and ritual clock are legible. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—loss of the prior self—so 9.0 gate is cleared despite a fractional over-articulation of price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds without ellipsis gaps: charm→statue→memory projection→workshop panic→decision to remain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 110 words. Closure is a Decisive Change: she elects to guard the patched past aboard a doomed workshop, cost legible in ‘the weight of centuries creaking under her feet.’ Persistent constraint—acid sea and failing gears—shapes every beat and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the painting crystallizes her reconfigured stance toward the world, with felt cost in her lighter heart. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of mirrored water / inverted world imagery reweights the stake of permanence. The wrong-turn block is coincidence, yet it complicates rather than solves, satisfying Situational allowance. No causality break, but the cost is emotional, not material—just enough to clear the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft epiphany—woman quotes the tag-line and vanishes, leaving Elias “not abandoned,” a Charged Poise without felt price. Causal chain: cork hum → smell → woman’s maxim is magical convenience; each leap is untested and resets rather than narrows options. Orientation clear by 50 words; no penalty, yet the lens is Accumulative/lyric, not causal, so escalation is atmospheric repetition rather than because/therefore pressure. Cost is asserted (“his doubts” gone) but not enacted or forfeited on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—beacon shining, community growing—yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized (no forfeiture, no risk paid). Causal chain is thin: because the moon is full the device hums, because it hums wanderers arrive; Mara’s agency is limited to assembly, not choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain intact: trowel hits eye → truth leak → village consultation → dawn ritual → reburial; each beat narrows options under Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): orchard exhales, Elias smiles, cost visible in the relinquished control. One soft spot: the textbook ritual is introduced late and accepted without pushback, so the final beat’s causal weight is more borrowed than earned, nudging down from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Acc cumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, scent, print, journal, and beam form a dense echo-chain whose final cadence—beam slicing fog while Elias holds both relics—reweights “remember” from puzzle to vocation. Orientation locked by word 80; causality intact: finding the fresh print → kneel → journal → guardianship. Middle lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an alternate path (he could have burned the journal, etc.), so escalation is present but mild; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: borrowed memories now lodged in a new keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the blank map that gains a glowing line is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise—choices, not artifacts, create direction. Causality holds under the Situational lens: each beat compresses Elias’s stance until he accepts guardianship. The Orientation Test is passed: who/where/when are anchored by word 60. No teleporting props; the matrix chip, ants, archway, and map form an unbroken chain. Cost is visible—“the weight of the promise settle on his shoulders”—but not persistent; no future constraint is foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain is present (dreams → climb → revelation → vow) but compressed into scenic summary; the decisive change lands as a declarative vow, not a charged image or action, so the closure unit carries only conceptual cost; “softly commanding voice” interior monologue is the closest we get to a micro-turn, and it is still expository.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the nexus air “richer,” sky “more vivid,” friendship reweighted into a spiral of “endless possibility.” Causal lens holds—every beat follows because/therefore: shell glow expands because Elara chants; Kael’s touch therefore ratifies the success. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark: “ember nexus at twilight,” two named characters, contiguous present. Cost is visible in the final image: the twilight itself is altered, proving the world’s rules have been repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: the scroll’s glow, the shifting dream-fragments, and the sentence “The story is not in the past or future—it is now” act as pattern breaks that reweight the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that lands with felt cost—her nostalgia is literally lifted like fog—so the ending satisfies under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, drip, screw, and scent-loss accrete until the final image reweights “ordinary miracle.” Orientation is clean inside 70 words; no teleporting objects. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara palms the screw, accepts occluded senses, and the phrase “trembling calm” is repriced as earned stasis; cost is felt in her relinquishing the hope of restored smell. One soft spot: the screw’s back-story arrives late via Mira’s exposition; the piece teaches the pattern early enough to waive penalty, but the causal link is slightly diluted.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill’s return to sleekness reconfigures the rule-set—fear acknowledged, platform now sanctuary—cost felt in the same breath. Causal lens holds: because she confronts the superstition, therefore the quill de-crystallizes and the storm pauses. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“floating rock tea ceremony platform”) and never breaks. One scaffold loop—“the platform swayed gently, as if in sync with her thoughts”—dulls momentum but misses the climax beat, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bottle’s lightness reweights the premise—regret is not erased but metabolized into current. Causal chain holds: orchard doom → bottle hum → current apology → archive glow, each ‘because’ tightening options. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the final image—“scent lingering on her skin”—a persistent constraint she’ll carry past the tree-fall.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary merging with the mural crystallizes “spiral arbitration” into a universe-scale reweighting, felt cost signaled by temple tremor and hush-to-harmony shift. Orientation anchors early; causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught and coherent at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias cannot accept clock-seconds as truth, he counts backward; therefore the key slips, revealing the notch; therefore he opens the compartment; therefore the parchment re-prices time itself. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“horizon measurement station… between jagged peaks and a sea of mist”). One meaningful tightening occurs at the backward count’s climax when the key falls and the slot is discovered. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the horizon clears, mist lifts, and Elias’s whistle redefines the day—cost is the irreversible loss of his prior certitude.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing—the mushroom reweights “boundaries are bridges”—but the lack of any prior tactical use of permeability means the cost is conceptual only, not felt. Causality is loose: footprints appear, figure declaims, gift accepted; no because/therefore linkage tightens options. Orientation is clean by 120 words; however, the mid-scene arrival of the stranger dissolves pressure rather than escalating it, so the lens slips from situational to declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final notebook moment reweights the subway-scrawl premise and leaves the next move legible yet unsettled. Causality is soft—accumulative/textural rather than strict because/therefore—but the pattern is taught early and holds. The single-scene orientation is clean; library anchors arrive by ~80 words. Cost is conceptual (inheritance of unanswerable questions) rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Eli dials a long-abandoned number, foreclosing isolation with a visible social cost the reader feels. Causal chain: each spectral call tightens the loop until the disc forces agency; no plot amnesia. Orientation is clean by line 4; tunnel, booth, and operator are anchored well before 120 words. Lens is Causal throughout; the final “I’m ready to begin” crystallizes the altered path.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The station’s magical restoration is a vivid Decisive Change, but causality is external: the clock catalyzes the reversal without Elara having to sacrifice, wager, or even mis-judge anything. Reciprocity is asserted by the doubles rather than enacted by Elara; the lens drifts from causal to situational spectacle. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the closure’s cost is only metaphorical (“the world still vast, but no longer indifferent”)—no on-page price is extracted from her. The rumor chain that brought her is mentioned once and plays no tactical role, leaving the inciting logic thin.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass stills, reweighting “north” as internal. Accumulative lens holds—density of absorbed languages crystallizes into one note. Cost is legible: “the melody remained, etched into her soul.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is intact: anomaly → summons → void entry → pen activation → timeline restitch. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky is only “a mere ripple,” a visual cost paid for her invisible inscription. The lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt. One minor wobble: we never learn why Elara can write in vacuum—rule shift isn’t cued, but it arrives at the climax and the image still reweights stakes, so the flaw is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight, camera, and sign-language gestures layer into a crescendo that reweights silence as music, landing a Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost—“the silence was no longer empty.” Orientation is immediate; causality is metaphoric rather than sequential, acceptable under this lens. One tightening: the impossible click reframes her ritual, foreclosing isolation. No beats break the pattern; the final image crystallizes options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scroll re-weights the vandalized portrait/tapestry pair with civilizational love-sacrifice cost. Causal chain is present—tapestry → portrait → mural → sketches → scroll—yet each jump is declared (“they realized”) rather than forced by pressure. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. The because/therefore links are functional but thin, so the tightening feels administrative, not inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lagoon reweights memories into collective bridge, cost felt in “tears...purifying.” Drive lens (Accumulative) holds—pattern of echo, hum, glow tightens to final cadence. Orientation anchor clear by 50 words; no penalty. Causality thin: ripple-hum response is magical coincidence, not earned by prior agency; still, the lyrical reconfiguration satisfies the required RR/CR with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the passage opens, the duo step into alien light, and the labyrinth’s whisper-rule is reweighted with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—key fits lock, wall recedes—yet the lock’s sudden appearance feels engineered rather than seeded. Map’s self-unfolding is a late rule; no prior beat teaches it can react to bearer motion. Lens is Situational; pressure coheres but the final shift is more scenic than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: shutter patterns and mirror glints layer until the stranger’s reflection literally re-weights self-image—Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (the guardian’s perpetual solitude). Causality is lyric rather than plot-based, taught early and held. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the completed constellation of shutters coincides with the stranger’s final exhale, narrowing possibility from despair to release.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—town pausing before glowing windows—visible cost is the coach’s solitary vigil, but causality is thin: grotto inspiration → organize displays is summarized, not shown in linked beats. Orientation holds; library/grotto spatial logic stays coherent. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “amplified quiet” and cadence tightens at final hush. Still, the decisive tightening beat (displays going live) is off-stage, blunting because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is loose: whale-call → island appears → barrier dissolves when scrimshaw is dropped. The treaty ban on violence is mentioned but never tests or constrains tactics, so the world-rule feels ornamental. Closure is Charged Poise (image of fading island) and carries lyric cost, yet the lens shifts from causal to accumulative without teaching the pattern early. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whittled heart pressed to the window reweights the mandate’s silence and makes the cost legible. Causal chain holds: brother’s death → bouquet relic → secret whittling → heart object → pressed against glass = refusal foreclosing exposure. Single-scene orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The one soft spot: the mandate’s enforcement mechanism is off-stage, so the stakes tighten more conceptually than concretely, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ambient causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image layers density until the ice shards float upward as a cadence shift. Yet the closure beat—“they had become a part of its song”—states rather than dramatizes cost; no option is foreclosed, no price is legible on the page, so the Resonant Reconfiguration remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glass shards, plant patterns, and reed hum layer until the final image re-weights beauty as non-chromatic. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; courtyard, Elias, post-phoenix timeframe are anchored. Causality is present but soft—plant-code always works, reed awakens on request, glassblower’s praise arrives without resistance—so pressure feels curated rather than tested. Closure lands as Charged Poise: concertina’s “living” music and the monochrome canvas crystallize a new stance, but the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft epiphany (“she felt a sense of purpose”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost; the lens refracts sounds but never forces Elara to relinquish or risk anything. Causality is loose—because she listens, she understands—without a tightening beat that narrows future options. Orientation is clear by word 80, but the accumulative lens never escalates stakes; pattern repeats rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the vine projected on the walls reframes her ritual craft into living botany, the cost is the irreversible mark on her skin that forecloses permanent widow stasis. Causality is light-driven rather than strict because/therefore, but the accumulative pattern holds; however, the origami coordinate chain is set up more than it is paid off, a mild telegraphing debt.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: crash → data anomalies → confide → collaborative reverse-engineering → Tower-as-blueprint insight. Closure is a conceptual repricing (“the Tower had fallen, but from its ruins…”) with undeniable social cost, satisfying Q2’s cost test. One soft spot: Mira’s blockchain evidence arrives as told summary, blunting the decisive change’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda reframes the past as gift, not burden, with unmistakable cost (“hollow places within her soul” filled). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and cadence shift from twilight gloom to liquid-gold mist reweight the stake. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no因果 breaks. The beat is one continuous scene; scope default satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow’s transformation into sculpture reweights the premise, felt cost legible in “luminous regret.” Causal chain holds—footage comparison → vial discovery → metamorphose—though the 40% mark could anchor the vial’s rule sooner. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of glowing objects escalates density to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—tail on shelf, new pattern of tools—but the causal engine is retrospective summary: the con is already exposed, so the “reconstruction” beat is purely declarative. One shard only; orientation clear by word 60; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the cost is only metaphorical (“layers peeled”), not tactile or irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged hourglass sand reweights time and memory, producing an undeniable before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30 and the pattern holds. Causality is loose—plants telegraph tunnel, tunnel yields second hourglass, reunion magically heals—but the final image crystallizes meaning with visible cost (scars fade). The “because/therefore” chain is intuitive rather than tight; the miracle resolves the conflict it introduced, so escalation is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The film strip’s causal chain is clear: found → incubated → reveals letters → reweighted meaning → taken. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of her descending with the strip crystallizes a new purpose and forecloses leaving the love archived. Cost is conceptual—she now shoulders the repository—but the beat is compressed into one sentence; the tightening is legible yet not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—Lira at the archway, aurora swelling, astrolabe alive—so a Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural, not causal; no beat narrows her options or forecloses a path. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, yet the “beginning” promise remains abstract; stakes deepen symbolically rather than tactically. Orientation is clear by word 80, satisfying the test, but the escalation is atmospheric intensification, not agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she clasps the charm, the dune pulls her; because she lifts the clock, the archive reignites. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—archive diverges, clock restarts—yet the cost is borne by the world, not the protagonist, so the price test is only weakly met. One causal gap: the clock’s prior irrelevance is told, never shown in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard layers sensory density until the machine-light reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the rainforest=reverie equation lands with conceptual cost—“he was its explorer, its guardian” forecloses safe return. Transitions are legible via sleep-jumps taught early; orientation anchor satisfies mosaic track.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a crisp Charged Poise: the blank ticket and air-punch transfer the star stamp to Mara herself, a clean conceptual re-pricing. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict; the indirect river path and misty ridgeway tighten texture until the final image reweights the premise. The ferryman’s age-slip is unmotivated and risks a late rule change, but it does not break the lyric pattern already taught. Cost is felt: the ticket’s erasure and the ferryman’s final “go” foreclose return.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is clean: bolt-touch → conceptual repricing of silence as fear, piano chord as earned stasis. Causality is accumulative/textural: stained step teaches pattern early, bolt reprise reweights meaning. Cost is legible—“the bolt now… heavy with knowledge”—and final image forecloses pure silence. One minor loop: “silence” is repeated 7× in 70 words, dulling cadence, but does not break lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—rune re-signified, pretender unmasked—so RR is present. Yet causality is montage-style: “days turned into nights” skips the tightening linkage between messages and collapse; we’re told escalation, not shown narrows. Orientation is functional by 120 w, but lens ambiguity (Acc vs Causal) persists until late, softening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the coastline is re-priced as a site of original sin, and the atlas page’s torn edge becomes the visible cost of willful amnesia. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each reef datum, tap rhythm, and atlas symbol layers until the final image reweights the stakes. The piece teaches its pattern early and lands the charge cleanly. A 0.4 deduction because the decisive tightening—her realization—arrives in exposition rather than dramatized action; we are told she “realized,” not shown her body register the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: star-images and hum-density layer toward a Charged Poise ending—the cosmic thread vision reweights her stance with conceptual cost (“she would reignite them, not with weapons…”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no penalty. Causality is lyric, not sequential—pressure accumulates through sensory repetition (skylight slivers, rising hum) rather than because/therefore turns. Closure is valid RR, but the beat of transformation is delivered by the stone circle’s external magic, not a prior constraint she actively tests, so cost feels adjacent rather than personally wrought.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: kite-script → decode → embryo-touch → unsealing-light. Orientation is clear by 80 words; closure is a Decisive Change charged by the glowing cracked embryo and the plants’ hush. Cost is present yet thin—no forfeiture or persistent constraint is shown on-page. The lens holds, but the price is more implied than felt, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sketchpad left on bench + photo in pocket reconfigure her stance from fleeing memory to curating it—an Earned Stasis with felt opportunity cost. Causal lens holds: slip → freeze → sketch is a because/therefore chain; no coincidence rescues her. The photograph’s flutter off the cliff is a crisp external turn that tightens the stake to “retrieve or lose the last link.” Orientation is anchored by scent + location within 60 words; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern room is not reached by authorial fiat but by causal chain—untangling cards → reframed meaning → physical ascent—so the lighthouse light is reweighted as internal possibility, not external rescue. Orientation is anchored by word 40; the single spiral-stair transition is legible; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of image-return) holds without late ambiguity. Cost is felt in the final beat: “the ache remained… her guide,” satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor loop: “ luminescent ache” reused four times; does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: drone trace → tent encounter → ink vision → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing on the final walk-away image (“canvas waiting to be filled”) with felt cost (grief faced, brother’s death un-erased). One minor causal hiccup: the woman’s identity and access to the ink remain unmotivated, but the beat is not resolution-critical.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is clean—letter → descent → terminal → download—but escalation is declared (“the clock was ticking”) rather than tightened by on-page obstacles. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the snow-covered exit image reweights her world, yet the cost is only abstract (“her world would never be the same”) without a concrete price shown. Drive lens is Causal; linkage holds but lacks a final constraining consequence that forecloses retreat. Orientation is met before 120 words; no spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: tower fall → farm refuge → Kael warning → blade acceptance, each a because/therefore pivot. Closure is Earned Stasis: she keeps the farm and the blade, peace now contingent on potential violence—cost is the forfeiture of uncomplicated innocence, crystallized in the final image of sheathed weapon beneath blooming roses. No orientation debt; anchors clear by word 50. One telegraph: Kael’s arrival is slightly coincidence-shaped, but accepted within situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative lens is signaled early—constellation chaos, silence-music—and holds: each sensory layer thickens until the goddess apparition crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a legit Charged Poise: the rail spike glows, the garden’s song is rewired, Kael’s stance is reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost (“he had helped to restore” the cosmic lullaby). No orientation drift; transitions are legible within the single scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: telescope re-pointing = a Resonant Reconfiguration that reprices the observatory’s purpose (CR). However, causality leading in is elliptical—Eleanor’s sudden access after hours and the director-tea recap feel off-stage. Orientation is fine; the first 120 words anchor. Still, the decisive act needs earlier planted obstruction for full cost-legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds throughout: guilt → firmware amplification → letter discovery → forged replies → silence. The discovery-of-letters beat is a clear decisive turn that narrows options; the final meteor hush is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the laboratory…”) so the Orientation Test is waived. No causal gaps; every beat either raises the psychic volume or offers the one path Elara can bear.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tile dissolves into sand, reweighting meaning rather than resolving plot, with felt conceptual cost (“lilac unease remained, but…a guide”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification via mandala, mist, hush. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) achieved within 60 words. Minor slack: flake’s rule-set never constrains later tactics; causality is thematic, not physical.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s new image reframes mercy as strength, and the wind’s “scent of renewal” offers felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each tessera placed adds density until the plaza becomes beacon. The lens holds, but the orientation anchor is soft—no time cue until “after the great fire,” ~150 words in; the waiver applies because disorientation serves the lyric pattern. The ending lands cleanly, yet the middle sags with repeated paraphrases of the same impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s dawn light and the woman’s renewed step reconfigure possibility for both Maras; the cost is Mara’s renewed solitude, felt in the “bittersweet smile.” Causality holds: coin-touch → color shift → emotional transfusion → timeline mend. Orientation is taught early (“the moon hung low…”) and space remains coherent. One soft spot: the mechanism of “echo production” is asserted more than dramatized, a minor ellipsis that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn image crystallizes a reweighted premise—broken minds can be re-lit. Causal chain holds: shock → geode touch → devise ritual → light-map → charged hope. One transition (night→dawn) is legible; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new heat-map layer and fossil pulse thickens emotional density until the carvings ignite. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes into “storyteller”—but the cost is conceptual, not felt on-page; nothing is forfeited or foreclosed. Orientation is clear within 120 words, transitions are smooth, yet the pivot from data to myth relies on magical escalation rather than a because/therefore choice. The lens ambiguity cap does not apply, but the missing tangible price keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of buttons → echo swell → prophecy re-weighting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar falls silent and Elara pockets the bone button, a visible token that the canyon’s rule-set has shifted from fatalistic echo to portable possibility. Cost is legible in the final image—the once-reverberant jar is now inert, its power spent. The orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative pattern of snow-codes → letter → dawn offers a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands cleanly in a Charged Poise micro-turn: “unused courage” is re-accessioned, not consumed. Persistent constraint (scars, winter that has not fully turned) shapes the final image and forecloses retreat. Cost is felt but compressed; a more embodied stake paid on the page would lift this to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-scene causal spine holds: needle → stranger → scroll → recognition. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Yet closure beat is summary—“the promise is yours now”—with no concrete alteration of options or price; causality lands soft, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass’s final warm pulse reweights every prior shard of timeline light, proving compassion is the Oasis’s preservative. Causal lens holds throughout—each sun-pattern discovery is a because/therefore step toward communal action. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by sentence three; no penalty. Cost is palpable in the last line: “the glass continued to thrum,” a persistent constraint she now carries for the rebuilt hive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece lands a lightweight Charged Poise: the two retain their separate lives but now share a “quivering hush,” a felt reconfiguration rather than a causal change. Cost is only implied—they might meet again—so the closure skirts the visible price required for 9-band entry. Orientation is swift and lens holds accumulative/lyric pattern, but escalation is static; beat structure is observe-observe-observe, observe-observe-resolve, which keeps the tightening gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal-Accumulative hybrid: every beat is a because-therefore linkage (“sundial opens door therefore orb accesses lineage”) that tightens knowledge and narrows option space. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elena’s body becomes the library’s tuning fork, costing her unbounded solitude—felt cost in the final image (“light pulsating in sync with her heartbeat”). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) established within 50 words; no teleporting props or logic leaks. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length; the orb transfer is irreversible and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the spiral re-weights the universe for her, the crowd, and the reader. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each noticed droplet, arch, and reflection thickens until the final image detonates quiet meaning. The cost is the talisman itself—she walks away lighter because she has paid it into the groove. No orientation debt; the lotus-temple/lily-pond anchor is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: signal → decode → counter-frequency → social fracture. Orientation is clean by word 60; the single-scene default is met. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the station stays hers, the cost is the widening campus rift announced outside the window—felt, not declared. No teleporting props; charts and subwoofer track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: compass quiver → needle locks upward → hidden passage → shard → chamber contraction/expansion. The “lonely church organ” motif is seeded early as ambient legend and paid off as audible code that reweights the shard, satisfying closure with conceptual cost (she now carries the mutiny map inside her). Orientation anchors who/where by word 60, well under the 120-word trigger. One soft spot: the spatial-mutiny rule is asserted more than demonstrated until the final dilation; still, the because-therefore spine stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry portrait crystallizes Elara’s stance—“bridged the gap, one stroke at a time”—with felt conceptual cost (she leaves with only an image, no hard evidence). Causal chain is lean but intact: ribbon clue → silhouette confrontation → artistic re-visioning; the missing police file motivates but never becomes a loophole. Orientation is clean by line 5; the mosaic of mist, ribbon, and tool tightens rather than fragments the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each journal stanza tightens the because-chain toward the ritual, and the exile reversal is paid for by relinquishing the nail. Orientation is secure inside 120 words (cliff station, shifted jet, personal quest). Closure is a clear CR: the sky calms and the journals “no longer cryptic,” reweighting history at conceptual cost. The only micro-slip: the stanza mechanic is revealed late, so the ritual feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass flake becomes a gateway map and “pixelated amnesty” a literal sanctuary, reweighting the premise. Causality is loose—scaffold-wrap method appears only at the final beat, not tested earlier—so the reconfiguration is clever but not earned by prior tactics. Still, the before/after is legible under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spread bills under moonlight reweight the train’s cycle-of-failure theme with felt cost—“some paths circle back…to teach us.” Causal lattice holds: each car discovery is a because/therefore step toward that revaluation. Orientation is secure within 120 words; no teleporting props. The scavenger beat is a micro-turn that tightens options, but the momentary standoff evaporates without lasting constraint, keeping the escalation just shy of higher-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the telegram’s message is reweighted into a rule that “no burden was meant to be carried alone.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—star patterns and inscription fragments accrete until meaning crystallizes. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the reader sees the idea dawn but not a concrete forfeiture or path foreclosed. causal linkage is loose: star-alignment coincidence drives the insight more than any irreversible choice she makes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the plant roots stabilize the lake while Eira’s confession reweights her self-image. Causal lens holds throughout—each circle is a because/therefore step toward surrender. The seed’s glow and the vortex’s calm are the visible price. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant mends, glade balanced, Elara rooted in new but costly harmony—“the scars on her hands pulsed in response.” Causal chain holds: clipping → path → pedestal → light-spread. Orientation is swift (“cobalt glade at dusk” by line 2). Minor slack: covenant rules are revealed only at payoff, so the price feels abstract rather than personally foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “I’ll stay” reweights every seed and carving with permanent self-exile. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—root patterns, tokens, and wall stories layer until the doppelgänger crystallizes the debt. Orientation is met inside 120 words; the single off-page jump (“years ago”) is legitimately ellided. Cost is felt in the final breath, satisfying the 9+ cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the pocketing folds the past into a future stance, cost legible in the phrase “his to fill.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of echo/silence deepens until the cadence shift reweights meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Persistent constraint (hollow quarry) charges final image without forcing causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ripe fruit re-weights transition from theory to lived truth, with a faint felt cost (“work was far from over”). Causal chain is thin—seed glows because she plants it, visions arrive without prior setup—so the beat feels magical rather than earned. Orientation is swift and clean; only one causal ellipsis keeps it from the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as quiet Conceptual Repricing: accepting flux restores order with cost felt in communal disorientation, mirrored by the rearranged runes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ebbing light and shifting runes thickens until the final reconfiguration. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no causality breaks. Escalation mild—orb act is single pivot rather than tightening sequence—but sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown’s light chorus reweights the bunker sanctuaries from shelters to communal hearts. Causality holds: pearl-pull → chamber → crown activation. The “heartbeat of hesitation” timeframe, however, is announced but never tracked or jeopardized, so tension stays conceptual rather than tactical. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image crystallizes density without a physical price on Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each map fragment, graffito, and bellows-patch thickens the texture until the final self-map reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the accordion feels lighter not because pain vanishes but because options narrow—she can no longer chronicler others’ rivers while ignoring her own. The cost is the lifted fog itself, felt in the “unforgiving clarity” that ends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ambient causality holds: because the watch hums, therefore she follows, therefore she writes—each step tightening the library’s claim on her. The archway’s time-reversed glyphs teach the Accumulative pattern early; the final backward tick re-weights the premise with conceptual cost (she is now conduit, not seeker). Orientation is secured by line 5 (“edge of the mist”), well inside the 120-word window. The only slack is the off-page stranger who gave the watch—an unmotivated seed that never loops back—so the lens stays intact but not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the violin’s song rewrites the air, Dominion scouts freeze, and the relic goes opaque—an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each coffee-stain image and plant murmur layers density until the single sonic release. The “tree split at its core” stain is a tight causal seed that flowers in the final root-riot, proving set-ups were kept.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald dims, traveler vanishes, and Elara steps forward into an altered stance toward stillness; cost is felt conceptually. Causality, however, is thin—the chip’s power is asserted, not constrained by rules, so the revival beat borders on miracle. Orientation is secure: who/where/when anchored within 60 words. Single continuous scene obeys scope default; one meaningful tightening (infuse → stillness lesson) satisfies escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.4)
    Closure image (hairpin glowing, garden vivid) offers Charged Poise, but the lens is blurred: the middle is dream-logic accumulation, yet the ending wants causal repricing. The hairpin’s map, the shell-portal, and the star-lake are three consecutive MacGuffins that simply appear; none trace back to Elara’s prior decisions, so causality is retroactively patched rather than earned. Orientation is clear, but the Orientation Test is waived—disorientation is never taught as a pattern that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard-filled letter reweights doubt from curse to tool, paying a felt opportunity cost (Elias relinquishes his symbolic “conscience” talisman). Causal lens dominates—because he deciphers the chimes he therefore reframes Mara’s dilemma, and the mirror fragment is the therefore vehicle that carries the new frame to her. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the wind-chime cipher is declared successful rather than shown complicating a micro-choice, but the final image still crystallizes under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reaches for Resonant Reconfiguration—her spoken confession reweights her prior silences—but the causality is retroactive summary (“she told of her discovery…”) rather than an on-page scene where options narrow or cost is felt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: ripple imagery accretes meaning until the final stone reframes the pattern. However, the decisive change happens off-camera; we are told the grotto “fell silent” instead of witnessing the audience’s reaction or her bodily risk. Because cost is only asserted, the tightening stays conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—echo, dust, layered time—and closure arrives via Charged Poise: ‘the greatest journeys were those taken within’ reweights the arrowhead from tool to mirror. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no causality breaks; persistent constraint (the canyon’s echoic stillness) shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights “simple” effort as sacred, with cost felt in the brightened luminance on exit. Causal chain holds—harness → mist-walk → survival → insight—though the trap’s geometry is vague and the keystone’s rules appear only when needed. Orientation is secure by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The primary weakness: stakes never tighten beyond a generic “prove himself,” so the final reconfiguration is softly charged rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank page inscribes Elias’s luminous vow, reweighting the night sky. Causal chain is light—key glows, therefore book opens—but causal ellipsis is acceptable under lyric-accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no late ambiguity. Cost is present yet diffuse; the price is opportunity rather than tangible loss, keeping the beat just under high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: coins → observatory → distillation → prophecy decode → coin sequence; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Charged Poise—the coins reframed as roadmap—whose conceptual cost (universe’s rebirth burden) is legible in the last paragraph. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity; one soft spot: the prophecy’s rules are revealed retroactively rather than tested mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the named constellations re-weight her grief and re-open her vocation, cost felt in the now-heavy parchment. Accumulative lens holds: each whispered echo layers density until the naming beat reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when anchored by line 3. Causality is soft on why this atlas page answers her loss, but the pattern teaches early (“she had carried it ever since”) and pays off in the final image, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: droplet cadence and bell-repair repeat until the first wave reweights the stake. Closure lands with a felt Conceptual Repricing—the single wave reframes the world’s stillness—yet the cost is symbolic rather than tactical. Causality is poetic, not mechanical; the viaduct’s “agreement” is charming but unanchored in rule-based consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the framed label in the town hall crystallizes a new communal stance toward memory, cost paid in Elias’s overnight labor and the town’s exposed grief. Causal linkage holds—each photograph found tightens his obligation until the exhibit becomes inevitable. One soft spot: the “trail of photographs” appears as a fait accompli rather than a choice-triggered discovery, blunting the final tightening beat by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the crystal+flame image reweights the premise and the starlings reprise, so RR is legible. However, causality is loose—starling “method” is asserted, not demonstrated, and the altar-flame arrives unprompted, undercutting because/therefore linkage. Cost is only vibes; no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn light reframes the buckle into emblem of “trust, once preserved, could never be broken,” a conceptual repricing with undeniable social cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is late—no concrete where/when until ~140 wds—but the dreamy disorientation pays off in the final image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived; however, the late anchor still blurs early causality. Escalation is a single, steady rise: static clears → pattern seen → dawn revealed; because the tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical, the cost feels diffuse. The buckle’s earlier life-saving memory is cited but not dramatized, so the stakes hinge on lyrical assertion rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each sword exchange = because/therefore test that narrows options until the jar-shatter Decisive Change lands with glass-cost. Orientation clean by 120 words; floating dojo + amber brain anchor taught early. No teleporting props; brain’s glow and sword symbols pay off closure. Minor ellipsis: clone legal status skipped, but the emotional duel overrides the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the key’s burial opens the bank-door and the archive of future seeds, a literal Decisive Change with conceptual cost—his haven is now an endless assignment. Causal chain holds: smudged envelope → seed → key → door, each because/therefore legible; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation complete by line 5; micro-turn at seed-splitting tightens options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tunnel exhales warm laughter, proving the symphony reweighted silence itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gust layers density until cadence shifts at the crescendo. Orientation is taught early (“echo chamber tunnel stretched endlessly”) and anchors hold. Cost is legible in the cool handle and Eli’s heaving chest; no因果 leaps break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: pendant appears → summons keeper → presents bargain → Elara refuses, foreclosing return path. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with visible cost—“the pendant’s glow dimmed, its power dormant for now”—and the lens stays causal throughout. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Minor causality bump: keeper’s rule (“garden will fade”) asserted rather than demonstrated, but Elara’s choice accepts the risk, preserving linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crozier fragments literally feed the sapling, reweighting failure into fertile ground. Causality is lyric rather than tight—each failed experiment is named, not dramatized—so the “penny drops” feels authorial rather than earned. Orientation is clear inside 120 words, but the drive lens drifts from Causal to Accumulative, weakening the final image’s cost legibility. The ending satisfies the rubric, yet the middle linkage is too compressed to feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the city revives and silence is redefined, carrying conceptual cost (“promise of the future”). Orientation is secure by line 5; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of refrains (“silence,” “beginning in every ending”) intensifies until cadence flips. The causal spine is thin—twist dial → glow brightens—but causality is not required under this lens. Cost is felt, but the constraint (what Elara can never do again) is not foreclosed on the page, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean—hourglass map → rift dive → ferry reset—but the midpoint escalation is delivered in explanatory summary (“she felt herself stretched thin”) rather than dramatized beats, softening the cost signal. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: glowing sand confirms timeline merge, and Mara’s collapse supplies visible cost. However, the rift rules are invented on entry and the hourglass mechanics appear only at climax, so the payoff is resonant but not fully earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gallery reset to “solid and unmoving” against Elara’s sharpened perception—conceptual cost is legible. Causal chain holds: weave → gallery erupts → memory intrusion → warning → resume → dissolve. One minor elasticity: “memories alter” is declared twice before any on-page memory appears, a soft causality hiccup, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery of aliens → Council’s shutdown threat → Elara’s counter-ritual → augmented towers survive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chain link’s pulse and star-alien overlay rewrite what “navigation” means, with conceptual cost (human centrality lost). Orientation is anchored by sentence 4; no penalty. Lens (Causal) holds; because/therefore links tighten options without coincidence. The ending beat crystallizes a new map rather than settling every political thread—exactly the scale this length rewards.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: hearing-aid pulse → breadcrumb search → photograph → charge to protect. Closure lands as Charged Poise: photograph warms, hush follows her out; conceptual cost (“even the smallest voices were heard”) is legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no disorientation taught for later payoff, but also no penalty. Single scene, default scope met; one micro-turn (pulse clarifies from faint to urgent) tightens rather than reverses.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal linkage holds: mentor debt → return → fleck → phase jump → knowledge → acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she renounces full mastery of the invisible, paying with permanent ontological uncertainty, signaled by the codex’s dimming. The cost is legible, yet the vault→liminality shift is narrated more than dramatized, softening the decisive change beat. Compression is strategic, but the late rule of “phase transition” is asserted, not seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: death certificate glitch → search → defragment → ghost voice → earned self-redefinition. Closure lands as Charged Poise—dawn light reframes error into agency with felt conceptual cost (“no longer defined”). Minor lag: orientation anchors (who issued certificate, why system failed) withheld past 120 words without later payoff; −0.3, still beats 7.5 floor.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Lira endures the diamond’s curse, language is saved, her copper veins fade as visible cost (“Lira collapsed… her copper veins faded”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-drenched beat thickens sonic texture until the diamond shatters and silence replaces cacophony. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the towers of bone…”). No causality breaks; the birds’ flight pattern is foreshadowed early and recurs to tighten the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden resets but Lena’s stance is permanently re-configured, cost felt in the “frostbitten hope that warmed her.” Causal chain holds: arrowhead pull → alcove → cryptid whisper → laughter → garden reset. Orientation anchored by word 50. One meaningful tightening only, sufficient for 700-word scope. No lens ambiguity; pattern of playful gravity taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard’s reawakening is legible, the statues’ dust is the price, and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural. Causality is intact—shell → heartbeat → root uprising—though the shell’s rule-set is slightly late-introduced. One fine slip keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each scanner sweep and drone dive is a because/therefore escalation that narrows safe options toward the bottle hand-off. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias watches the sky mend while remaining in the arcade’s shadow; the cost is the irreversible exposure of his act and the perpetual half-full satchel, foreclosing any return to neutral postman status. Orientation, transitions, and drive all cohere; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise image of restored carousel + halo pendant that reweights silence as generative. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern is taught by recurring “misting hush” and bells, paying off in final luminous hush. Minor causality bump: the oasis is discovered by literal wrong-turn coincidence without prior plant; luck complicates but does not resolve, so allowed under Situational pressure. The cost is conceptual (he now carries audible hope) yet still felt, satisfying the 9+ quick test for lens & cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doorway seals behind her, the scarf is whole, and she accepts guardianship—cost is the loss of the analog realm she just saved. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each geometric rearrangement thickens atmosphere until reality folds. However, the Orientation Test docks −0.3: “scientific poetry library” and “odd-hour” are clear, but calendar-time and spatial anchors (where are the patrons standing?) remain vague past 120 words and the payoff at closure doesn’t retroactively justify that disorientation. One minor teleport: the scarf floats free without a prior beat showing it loosened.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s choice to close the palette and keep walking reweights the premise—dream replaced by generative act, cost is the relinquishing of retrieval itself. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sunrise-photo-then-paint layers is taught early and tightened once when light ‘breathes’, reconfiguring meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 20, well inside 120-word window, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the shattering orb reweights the rule-set (idea freed into world), but the cost is only implied—no persistent constraint or price is legible on the page. Causal linkage is loose; the star-hint and ribbon are evocative yet function as talismans rather than because/therefore pivots. Orientation is crisp—nexus, twilight first star, vault—so no penalty, but the vault’s “living locks” logic is asserted, not demonstrated, softening tension. Overall, one meaningful tightening occurs (lock yields to mother-phrase) and the lens holds through the final image, meeting short-form sufficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: missing mushroom → locket → constellation path → sky alignment, each beat because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky–ring alignment reweights the greenhouse as a threshold, cost felt in the “world holding its breath.” One soft spot: the decades-later memory theft is told, not dramatized, so the emotional price is slightly abstract; still, the final image crystallizes options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard-mirror shifts from prison to portal, cost felt in the softened shadow. Causal chain holds: annotation → leaf geometry → shadow lightens; ellipsis between beats is motivated. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of leaf images and library dust reweights stakes—and holds to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece uses Accumulative/Textural escalation: each lyrical paragraph thickens the same emotional chord until the glowing sprout provides Charged Poise. Closure lands as a resonant image, but the causal chain is circular—seed inherited, seed planted, glow appears—so the “before/after” is mood, not changed options. No constraint or price persists afterward; the orchard simply feels nicer.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the slack net and lifted hush reconfigure meaning with cost legible in the image. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each unraveled knot intensifies spectral density until the stillness flips. Orientation is clear by word 80; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “her hands moved with practiced ease, but her mind was elsewhere” restates the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: misalignment in the stones is discovered because Elara compares footage, therefore she digs, therefore she finds the chapel—each beat tightens options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chapel’s silence reweights the henge from relic to living testament, cost felt in her “heart heavy with reverence.” The price is legible but not irrevocable—scholars will come—so the tightening is meaningful yet not final; this keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: linking occurs through density of artifacts, recursive images (snow globe re-settling), and cadence shift to “lullaby” rather than causal reversals. Orientation is swift (first paragraph anchors who/where/when in 30 words). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the globe’s final placement reweights earlier hoarding into release, with the sailor’s letter supplying the visible rule change at cost. The only friction is a mid-story information parcel (map drop) that momentarily stalls momentum, but the tightened final beat compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost achieves coherence and Elara’s vocation reframes from unheard balladeer to voice-giver. The “between lightning and thunder” rule is taught early and charges the final bolt-plate encoding, so the causal lens holds. However, the middle is episodic—graffiti appears, device hums—without because/therefore links that tighten options; escalation relies on atmospheric accretion rather than irreversible turns.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sky-as-memory builds density until the glowing cumulus reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the gondola restored, Elara eyes the horizon newly weighted by felt cosmic custodianship. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—she now bears the archive of human lives—yet the causal chain is somewhat dream-logic; hence 8.1 not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hush → fractal detail → sky-in-book is taught early and lands with Charged Poise: “the stillness was no longer oppressive…boundless possibility.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; no penalty. One seamless scene, one meaningful tightening when the book safe is opened, re-weighting stakes from “find” to “contain infinite.” Building demolition supplies external cost, but no persistent constraint or price shapes Elara’s next move, keeping it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: each symbol decoded literally opens the next physical path (board → beam → hatch → map). Closure is a clean Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the map shimmers with the same light as the orbs, making the before/after legible and charging “Persevera” with earned cost—the mentor vanished pursuing this exact light. Only nit: the hatch has never been noticed before, a mild teleporting-prop bump.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gears hum, the ticking swells, and Elara’s stance is re-configured with conceptual cost (“weight of her purpose clearer”). Causality is linear—prophecy symbols → door → hall → gears → insight—so the lens is cleanly Causal; however, the mirror-vortex threat is announced but never actually endangers or forecloses an option, so the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: chalk message → Kael’s memory → scavenger team → bell strike → nebula return; no logistics breaks. Closure is a Decisive Change with sensory cost (sky shimmer, butterfly bloom) that lands on the page. Orientation is secure by line 4. mild −0.3 because the bell’s lost-clapper problem is solved by off-page memory (Jorin “remembered”), not a fresh obstacle; tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the puppet’s smile and steady beam reconfigure meaning with felt cost (her ragged breath, spent blood). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral layers tighten until cadence shifts at “blade of hope.” Orientation clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. Could edge higher if the cost were persistent rather than momentary.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: nut-impressions → map → rescue → bud breakthrough. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the bud is fragile, the birds still wheel, orchard still cursed—Earned Stasis achieved. Orientation within 120 words (who/where/when) lands cleanly; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: final breath + emergence image reweights separation→connection with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: brother-loss → lab exile → foam insight → bridge choice. Orientation anchored by word 50 (braided ravine, low sun). No teleport, no plot amnesia; chrysalis tracked throughout. Persistent constraint—grief as molecular tension—shapes final image; cost legible in “no longer just a polymer chemist.”

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the pouring moonlight reconfigures meaning, turning scattered fragments into cohering stories with a visible conceptual cost. Causality, however, is soft: the vial’s placement is “no accident” but lacks beat-level pressure; the ledge-cut is painless, the blank page a gift rather than a forced choice. Orientation is achieved early (who/where/when by line 6), so no cap triggered. A micro-turn (blank page) qualifies, but the cost is aesthetic, not personal, keeping the score shy of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of memory-flavors intensifies until the coral heart reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—pavilion melts, Elara lighter, cost registered in tears and dissolving shard. Orientation anchored by 75 words; no penalty. Causality intact: each memory tasted → pavilion weakens → final absorption. Cost legible in “tears welled” and “piece of her own sorrow” gone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the town’s collective voice reconfigures the broken social clock and Elara’s next song is fore-closed with fatigue. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the multilingual song layers until the mechanism and crowd “reply.” The price (Elara’s spent voice, the town’s exposed memory) is legible in the final paragraph, satisfying the 9+ cost test, but the prior escalation is more tableau than tightening, keeping it in the low 8s band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror becomes a portal that reweights her mission, and the cost is the surrender of her private memories to public ghosts—felt in the final image. Causal chain is thin: synaptic-plasticity method is introduced late and never constrained, so the decisive act reads as convenient rather than inevitable. Orientation is clear by word 80; one soft transition (memory paragraph) is handled with a spatial cue, satisfying the two-shard default.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: crystal descent + opened compartment = tangible Decisive Change with conceptual cost (“responsibility” made visible via glowing seed). Causal chain holds: doodle → inversion hour → seed. One minor scaffold loop (“luminescent veins” twice) and Orientation Test waived because disorientation pays off; lens stays situational/accumulative to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the grove now “no longer silent,” a perceptual re-pricing that costs her night’s labor and solitude. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each chisel strike layers resonance until the dusk-to-dawn clock completes; no tightening beyond the single night. Orientation is clear by word 30; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Hedgehog cue pays off by re-curling at end, sealing the transition, but no persistent constraint shapes future tactics, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: toppling the king reweights the covenant from burden to challenge. Causal chain holds: chess pattern → nexus amplification → insight → king-sacrifice → resolution to return. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 30; no penalty. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity. Cost is legible—“exile redefined as canvas”—but remains abstract; a tangible forfeiture (stone dropped/lost?) would secure 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp’s click reweights silence from absence to legacy, felt cost visible in “heart full” and whispered thank-you. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (hum, rustle, starlight) thickens until the diary’s reveal crystallizes meaning. Causality is internal—listening accumulates resonance—but the beat sequence is linear and coherent. No orientation debt; workshop, stool, night are anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean within 120 words; closure lands as Charged Poise—the final journal image crystallizes her reweighted stance with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sprout’s aroma triggers the insight; no causality break. Meets 9- gate (≥8.8) only if cost were more viscerally anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: arrow fuses, grove erupts, Elara’s role flips from seeker to protector. Causal lattice holds—every hologram burst or river pivot is triggered by object/planet feedback. Orientation crystal by line 5; spatial logic survives gravity flip. One lingering micro-gap: how the arrow physically “mends” is elided, but the reconfiguration cost is legible in her anchored stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: patch → wind funnel → crashed plane → foresight failure; orientation anchors within 120 w, escalation tightens at the collapsed stack; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing (“silence is echo of failure”) and visible cost on Elara’s stance—lens stays causal to end.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: amber sheet → bell strike → aurora conduit → ice-hush incarnation, each beat a because/therefore step. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—silence reframed as living possibility—visible in the line “stillness was not the absence of sound but the presence of possibility,” with felt cultural cost for her village. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity. One soft spot: the sculptor-chisel cue is off-stage and thinly motivated, a minor teleport of external timing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the flute’s note dissolves the canyon into iridescent elsewhere, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Causality is loose—driftwood markers appear only at point-of-need and the orb backstory is summoned to motivate without on-page traction—yet the pattern is legibly accumulative/textural under the hush-to-shatter cadence. Orientation clears by ~100 words; the lens holds, but escalation is single-shot rather than tightening. The cost is felt imagistically, satisfying the 9− gate, yet the beat remains solitary so the score caps at low-7.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias sets the fragment down, now dimmer, internal chorus integrated, stasis earned at visible price—he is “changed…in a way that resonated deep within his core.” Causal lens holds: each beat (touch→flood→retreat→acceptance) is triggered by the prior, narrowing options until endurance is the only path. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~60 words; who/where/when never waver. Minor slack: “mathematics of emotion” is declared twice but never operationalized as a rule that shapes tactics; still, the image of fragment-as-mirror recharges the opening, satisfying CR.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pendant’s final vibration reweights the world, giving Elara a new perceptual rhythm. Causality is soft—relics “choose” is asserted not demonstrated—but the pattern is taught early and the ending’s Charged Poise satisfies the lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s “truthful lie” reweights every prior refraction of light. Causal chain holds—because she chooses to read grief in glass, her theory is proven yet morally complicated. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of frost/light imagery intensifies until the final rainbow reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the heavier air itself, a rare CR that needs no bodily wound.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge reconfigures silence from unraveling to weaving with legible cost—“the weight of her sacrifice.” Causality is lyrical-accumulative; each puzzle shard deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns, coherent under inferred Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is present—planet healed, Eli “undeniably changed”—but the causality is soft: weaving silk into runes acts like a magic switch rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative, yet the final image reweights little because the price of Eli’s “awakening” is never specified; the story tells us he paid without showing the cost. Orientation is clear by 120 words, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the merged orb reweights her identity and duties with visible multiverse cost. Causal chain is sound—shard → transport → second shard → orb → guardian mandate—but the middle beat (alien forest) is a pure gift from the stranger rather than an earned turn. Lens holds (Situational crystallization).

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: flicker → dark discovery → stone code → letters → resolve. Orientation is clean by word 80; no prop teleporting. Closure lands as Charged Poise—lamp relit, sea glass warmed, stance crystallized—yet the cost (what he forfeits or risks) is only implied, not felt on the page. The persistent constraint (future guardianship) is announced, not dramatized, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the green dawn reconfigures the Herald’s role with undeniable conceptual cost (“bridge between worlds”). Causal chain holds—wick twist → beam veer → fog gate—though the veer is externally triggered, not a character-initiated reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present as Conceptual Repricing: “his journey was far from over” reweights the premise, but the cost is abstract, not felt. Causal chain is thin: because he owns the wing he sits, because sun hits he sees a thread, because thread glows he approaches; each link is coincidence rather than narrowing choice. Orientation beats anchor quickly; no lens ambiguity, yet escalation remains flat—no option is foreclosed, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight → sextant mending → dream coalescence deepens the same stake each beat. Closure achieves a Charged Poise in the final paragraph, but the cost is only asserted (“burden lifted”), not dramatized on Elias, capping the reconfiguration’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: dawn breaks and communities feel re-knit, cost implied in her now-steady hands. Causal chain is loose—mirror-crossing rules appear on demand; “because” hinges on dream-logic. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives ~80w, clear enough. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of recovered song-fragments thickens texture until final glow reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: blank book / seeking reweights meaning with conceptual cost. Causal chain: invitation find → archive search → blank-book epiphany; each beat follows logically. One minor ellipsis (how she accesses “deepest chamber”) is tolerated at this length. Orientation is clean by 90 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and held.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (damp earth, bread scent, plaque) deepens the stake of “tenuous absolution.” The bread’s reappearance acts as a pattern break that reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is clear by line 4; the single shard satisfies scope. Closure lands as Charged Poise: lantern-lit bread + lavender crystallize options and cost without needing a physical reversal. No因果 breaks; persistent constraint (ivy, ruins) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the transformed slide’s new inscription and lantern-bridge reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—oblivion deferred, duty enlarged. Causal chain is lean but intact: noticing anomaly → lantern activation → library tremor → altered vow → new purpose. One soft spot: the lantern-triggered tremor is accepted without事前 rule-teaching, but the accumulative lens holds. Cost is legible in the final line: “her heart alight,” a price of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is intact—fob left as taunt → Lila interrogates market → confrontation forces thieves to back down—but escalation is verbal brinkmanship only; the actual moonshine never reappears, so the “thwart” is announced, not dramatized. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila keeps the truce by walking away, sunrise sealing the stalemate. Cost is conceptual (trust permanently cracked) rather than felt—no lost resource, no wound, no new obligation—so the repricing is legible but thin. The lens holds; the missing tightening of on-page consequence caps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causal chain is thin: ring tastes sweet → she walks → cloaked infodump → acceptance. No concrete obstacle or reversal tests her stance; the election stakes remain abstract. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“you are one of them”), but the cost is off-loaded to future duty, not felt now.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new canvas and the surrendered lock together reweight her past, and the cost (a decade lost) is legible. Causality, however, wobbles: the forgotten painting+note appears precisely when needed, neither foreshadowed nor constrained, softening the “because” linkage. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of confinement images crystallizes—but the final intensification depends on a late, unearned artifact rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: map fragment → undercity chamber → truth of intentional sacrifice → Elara’s decision to engrave and release. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands on-page: chamber tremor and water trickle are Decisive Change with felt cost—her isolation and civic upheaval now inevitable. Persistent constraint (her candor-dependent craft) shapes tactics throughout; no outline-like "and-then" sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as quiet Charged Poise: the spinning iceberg refracts sunlight, reweighting the premise that wonder must be remade each winter. Causality is lyrical-accumulative; the lens holds, yet the beat where sculpture “takes shape” is summarized, not stepped through, so the cost feels conceptual rather than irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The box opening → miniaturization → emotional flattening chain delivers a clear Decisive Change with a felt price (nostalgia lost). Causality is tight: the magnetic-shift cue prompts the box, the box forces chaos-containment, containment drains memory. One causality bump: “strangely organic” is late-repeated without earlier anchoring, but it does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain holds: locket warmth → curiosity → key reveal → letter → communal sigh. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) rather than a decisive change, but the cost is diffuse—no path is actually foreclosed for Clara. Orientation is clean by sentence four; no lens ambiguity. The mailbox mystery resolves via off-page storytelling rather than earned tactics, keeping it below the 8.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dance decisively awakens the laboratory, reweighting sunken despair into living archive with visible cost—guardianship assumed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of decay → dance → revelation, each image layer tightening stakes without causal gimmicks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by phrase three; no penalty. One minor scaffold: “as the spider completes its web” re-explains time already felt.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt-chamber inciting image and the final “gleaming silence” reprise form a clean Conceptual Repricing: Eli re-enters the same room but sees it as a memory reliquary, not a lab. Causality is lyrical rather than plot-tight—coffee-ground patterns, whale omen, wildflower synapses—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty. Closure is quiet yet legible, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed prophecy creates a lingering vigilance whose cost is conceptually legible. Causality is soft—why this wing, why this brook, why now is elided—but the lyrical lens holds; the final image reweights the premise under an accumulative/textural drive. TheOrientation Test is passed by line 4, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal through-line is clear: meteor→visit→sugar→first knock. Closure gives a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the city’s architecture is now legible, the path foreclosed by her visible act of knocking. Cost is conceptual—she trades isolation for the vulnerability of listening—though not viscerally felt. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry is now inside her and the orchid has dimmed—an image that reweights the premise. Causality is soft: the shell “chooses” her off-stage, so the decisive turn feels handed over rather than earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-scene orientation is cleanly anchored by word 60; the rose thorn and scroll are taught as causal props. The lens is Causal: each stroke of the thorn literally dissolves ink and rewrites possibility. Closure lands with visible cost—the blank scroll—so the Decisive Change is on-page. However, escalation is gentle (one gradual fade) and the “key with no lock” mechanic is asserted rather than demonstrated or constrained earlier; that softens the tightness expected for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pool reweights her premise, showing echoes are deliberate cosmic threads. Cost is present—“quiet resolve” replacing melancholy—but it is felt conceptually, not bodily. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the echo motif intensifies through sensory refrains (“universe hummed”) and charges the final image. Missing early orientation—no concrete anchor of where or how time passes until ~140 words—would trigger −0.3, waived because disorientation pays off in the starlit dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is lyrical-accumulative; closure is a Charged Poise (globe clears, names spoken, dawn light). No causal tightening—dream fragments arrive gift-wrapped; no narrowing options. Orientation anchor late (~130 w), but disorientation is thematic and pays off. Cost is aesthetic, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-seeking density increases via firefly/moon imagery until the final “deliberate whistle” crystallizes stance. Closure is a Charged Poise: options reconfigure, cost is felt (she now carries the whisk and the night inside her). Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 3; no penalty. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs mid-text—pressure accumulates but never narrows options—so escalation stays modest. Still, the final image cleanly reweights prior motifs under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: diamond pulse → letter rearrangement → hidden message → containment ritual. Orientation is clean inside 120 words (who, where, when). Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the stillpoint is forced dormant, storms return, diamond dies. The “prison” twist is foreshadowed by the orchard’s creepy still air, so the reconfiguration feels earned rather than retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal spine holds: radio signal → portico activation → visionary transformation. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; storm & altitude anchor hold. Closure lands a Conceptual Repricing—symbols etched, dawn reframed—visible cost is the portico’s fracture and Elias’s tacit exile in new light. However escalation is单一的：中间段落用“weeks of deciphering”滑过，radio beats未产生递进选项，压力峰值仅靠命令句“Unfold it”推动，因此不具9+的持久约束力度。

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loft feels “emptier, yet fuller,” reweighting the premise that remembering is redemption. The music box’s autonomous spill is the decisive trigger; Elias’s dropped jar makes the cost visible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of capture, pattern breaks, cadence shift—without late convenience. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: vibration → recognition → ascent → key-glow → confrontation → harmonic counter-attack. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses alliance with the intruder and accepts perpetual guardianship under moonlight; the cost is the audible retreat of the ice and her solitary stance. Lens holds causal throughout; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara atop the viaduct, moonlight mirroring her “transformed spirit,” crystallizes the patient revolution she has seeded in others; cost is felt (she is now guardian of a quiet, ongoing responsibility). Causality between moon-tracking, viaduct hum, and internal shift is asserted rather than demonstrated—no beat shows a moment where lunar data forces a tactical trade-off—so the linkage remains soft under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single scene, stable POV, two-shard default met. A tighter causal hinge inside the final beat would push this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: drought-scented tunnel → fissure → hidden compartment → journal → mentor photo → renunciation. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the dawn hit on the grate re-weights all prior tunnel imagery and confirms her rupture from the mentor. Cost is present—the mentor’s betrayal is now irreversible and her career path is altered—but because the mentor is off-page the price feels social rather than visceral. Orientation is secured within 70 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking heart re-weights Elias’s duty and Thomas’s possible innocence, cost felt in the storm-coming image. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of broken→mended objects builds density until the final tick reframes everything. Causality holds: because heart is mended, therefore Elias must carry its moral weight. Orientation clean by 75 words; no prop or knowledge teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the iridescent bell rings, the world listens, Lira grins at chaos ahead—felt reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causality is traced: kaleidoscope transliteration → pattern → bell → call; no causal breaks. Orientation is clean by word 60. Reflection stays under 20 % and feeds present action. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (bell motif) reweights stakes; holds to end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: patch discovery → number pattern → song sync → Limbo folder → lie → offline hack → Mara audio → coordinate revelation → decision to expose. Each because/therefore tightens options until archive lockout forces the lie and offline gambit. Closure lands on-page: she steps out with memorized coordinates and the patch, a visible forfeiture of safety. The orientation anchor arrives inside 120 words (headset, archive, cold case), so no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s radiance reweights empathy-to-action as social cost. Causal chain is thin—fragments magnetize without prior rule—but the lens (Hybrid→Accumulative) holds. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Situational lens: accumulating encounters tighten her stance until the parasol catch under aurora reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation. Closure is Charged Poise—parasol aloft, ice lullaby—cost is the forfeiture of spectator distance she prized. Persistent constraint: frozen marina keeps her physically present for renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece layers vineyard imagery and letter motif until the closing reconfiguration. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she folds the fragment away, accepting “dance with mismatches”—with felt social/emotional cost. The tightening is single and gentle; no meaningful escalation narrows options mid-text, so the beat feels more poetic turn than causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens: consecration → parapet awakens → clearings shift is legible and sequential; the prophet’s arrival supplies the promised pivot, landing a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean within 40 words; spatial anchors hold. Stakes are declared early (“echo of wisdom might vanish”) and tighten to personal legacy, but no fork narrows her options—ritual success is never jeopardized—so escalation is ceremonial, not consequential. No object or rule break; causal chain intact, just low-torsion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each photograph-layer thickens the emotional density toward a Charged Poise at dusk. Closure—“the lavender field whispered its approval”—is a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the ruin-as-wound into ruin-as-resilience, but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized; nothing is relinquished or foreclosed. Causality is loose—Elara could have arranged the photos in any order with the same uplift—so the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-docket thickens the pattern until the crystal’s exhaustion becomes inevitable. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the blueprint for linguistic rebirth is gained at the price of the oracle itself—visible in “the crystal’s final echo lingered in the air.” Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, timeline anchored by “after the last dictionary was printed,” so no penalty. Causality is soft: the decoding method relies on intuitive “humming” rather than a rule-based trigger; the pivot feels more atmospheric than tactical, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk line and driftwood piece thickens the pattern until the hum surfaces. The circle of markers is a Charged Poise that reweights earlier wanderings with a boundary. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (fog garden, Elias alone, present tense). Causality is loose, but that is allowed under Accumulative design; the final vibration is a conceptual repricing of all prior echoes. No teleporting props; chalk and wood states are tracked. Closure cost is conceptual, not dramatic, yet undeniable—the map becomes a snare he steps out of.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the clock hand’s manic spin keeps intensifying the same stake until the pattern breaks with the leaf-sound insight. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: the hand now moves “in harmony,” reconfiguring time from enemy to partner; the cost is the relinquishment of “changeless stillness,” felt in the observatory’s new hum. One minor causality gap: why the earthquake happens is off-stage, but coincidence only complicates; it does not resolve, so the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clear and linear: blood-work clock → Elara summons Claire → reconciliation → deathbed closure. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the Orientation Test is satisfied. The closure beat lands a Decisive Change (mother-daughter reunion) with soft emotional cost, not protagonist cost; the lens is Causal and holds. One tightening turn suffices at this length; no plot amnesia or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is pristine: key → relearning runes → closing loops → noon-void demonstration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—midday shadow physics is rewritten and the key’s new weight is felt. One tightening beat suffices; no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain holds: tooth → maze → fountain → star, each because/therefore link legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone-for-certainty swap reweights her rule-set with felt cost (“lighter and fuller”). The Orientation Test is waived—garden disorientation is taught early and paid off in the mirror-fountain image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the grotto’s moonlit glass becomes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her childhood rule—light without fire—into a portable gift she can now carry to the village. The single shard of memory (mother’s line about cracks) is anchored to present polishing strokes, satisfying BRR; causality is purely Accumulative/Textural, but the final image crystallizes options with felt cost, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden shifts from private refuge to shared “honeyed hush,” reweighting vulnerability from liability to bridge. Causality is accumulative/textural: each moss stroke and icicle tracing thickens the texture of healing until Kai’s notebook catalyzes a crystallized poise rather than a plot twist. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in the final amber-lit silence—she has let another body inside the perimeter she built to survive viral exposure, a social risk made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fragment placed on the glowing tree reweights the premise—she will write, the stories will live—cost is felt in the solemn hush that follows. Causality is thematic rather than plot-level; the nexus “chooses” her, not vice-versa, so agency is passive. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cameos thickens until cadence shift in the final paragraph; lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orbs reconfigure village futures and her purpose, cost legible in the shift from solitary seeker to teacher. Causal chain is thin—singing succeeds because moon + tendril “align,” not because she risks anything撤销le. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of rising luminosity escalates stakes by intensification rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the plate glows and the orchard “hummed,” re-weighting the stake from private ritual to world breath—cost is implied, not dramatized. Causality is accumulative/textural: each sensory layer adds density until the final image crystallizes; no single because/therefore turn is required, but the lack of a visible price keeps the effect gentle. Orientation is clear within 120 words, lens holds, yet the “heartbeat-into-map” promise is never cashed, so the conceptual shift feels partial.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal spine: broken timer → angle study → dusk alignment → hum of harvest. The decisive change is on the page: the cavern fills with audible echoes, reweighting Elias’s reality. Orientation by 120 words is clear and concrete; the ending’s cost is felt (“fragile, like the first snowflake”) yet Elias’s future path stays implicit—cost is more atmospheric than specific, holding short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara turns the weaving method inward, lamp flame steadying to signal irreversible shift; cost is felt in the crack inside her and the foregone hand-off of others’ burdens. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each sensory layer (damp earth, metallic tang, star-mosaic ceiling) tightens the stake until the final cadence lifts. Orientation anchors by line 4, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pass of the chisel thickens emotional density until the finished lion crystallizes a before/after stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reweighted by the carved object itself, with felt cost in the tapering rain. A micro ambiguity: the “here and gone” refrain is stated more than dramatized in the final beat, a hairline slip that keeps it just shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lagoon’s renewed shimmer plus Mara’s forward step reconfigure meaning with undeniable emotional cost. The causal chain (wheel → voice → stand) is tight; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of fragments thickens until the final cadence shift. One scaffold loop (“fractured stillness” twice in four sentences) slightly dulls the final image, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s “living exhibit” reweights the premise that dead infrastructure can still navigate human hope. Causal chain is slim—redirecting air/light is described, not demonstrated to change options—and the sextant never re-enters the final beat, so the reweighting is atmospheric rather than prop-driven. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds. Orientation is clear by word 60. One tightening only, but it is legible and the cost is felt as obsolescence accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the finished clock’s moving hands reconfigure the sanctuary from cage to cradle, crystallizing that peace with the dream is possible without departure. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each whisper, scent, and tick layers density until the blank face is unbearable, forcing the inscription. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (“edge of the world”, “crystal whispering forecourt”, “hidden sunrise”). The cost is felt in the “tender smile” and the sanctuary’s lighter air; no contradiction mars the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sundial reconfigures its markings, Elara physically possesses the journal, and the canal’s “alive with possibility” serves as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—she now carries an accountable truth. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvage layer (debris, chest, journal, sundial glow) deepens pattern and reweights stake without relying on coincidence. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and never slips. One tightening beat—the chest opening—suffices to narrow options. Cost is present yet muted: no tangible loss beyond prior existential weight, keeping this just under the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single scene, single POV, orientation locked before word 120; causal chain is interior but tight—because the traveler witnesses, therefore the widow releases the thread, therefore both women exit the garden reconfigured. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the widow's life path is not physically changed, yet the obituary read aloud forecloses her identity as "the one who waits," and the traveler leaves with doubled thread-cost palpable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of thread, garden shadow, and ship afterglow accumulate until the final image reweights meaning. No artifact touches the cadence of the hymn-like reading.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s faint glow reweights the premise—beauty must be nurtured, not engineered. Causal chain is thin: map → passage → egg → assemble → voice-over; no intermediate choice forecloses an option. The “cost” is abstract (“sacrifice, patience”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on the page. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens holds as Causal, but escalation is single-step, so tension plateaus after the hologram speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: single scene, orienting cues by word 40, one deepening beat (kneeling to coin-and-seeds burial) that reweights the sterile sand into possible soil. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of “scars can sing” humming beneath the final image—earned by iterative pattern (fire ↔ life, coin ↔ foreign hope) and visible cost: she rises “hands stained.”

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the fountain’s reawakening reweights the city’s ontology and her own identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each breadcrumb thickens pattern rather than forcing causal turns—and the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost (“the box now whole in her hands, its light a beacon”). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the migrating-geese pause is named as timeframe but never exploited as ticking clock, so cost is felt but not sharpened by temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift of light-spill substitutes for causal reversals, and the final image reweights the stake (light without burn). Orientation is lyric-cloudy but disorientation is taught early and pays off in the closing glow, so waiver applies. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—“light that did not burn but embraced”—yet the absence of a visible, personal price keeps it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon→butterfly→chisel pattern tightens rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: final stone hums with “stories it now held,” reconfiguring meaning without tidy payoff. Orientation clean by 120 words; greenhouse, dusk, carver, spectral mentor anchored. Cost is felt—she leaves lighter yet carrying permanent migration—but the tightening beat (decision to etch ribbon pattern) is slightly undersold; more stare than struggle, so the 9+ gate not quite cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias’s reframed identity (“pendulum bob himself”) performs a Conceptual Repricing that makes the social cost of communal healing legible. Causality is accumulative/textural: rake-handle inscriptions → small preachings → observable town mending; the final image reweights earlier pattern rather than delivering a new plot twist. Orientation is anchored within first 80 words; single transition (evening pause) is legible. Lens holds without ambiguity; cost is felt in his acceptance of perpetual, quiet labor. Minor slip: escalation is gentle—one deepening rather than tightening—keeping it shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a lyrical reprise—the stars “shimmer brighter”—but the Decisive Change is off-stage (the tapestry is simply understood) and no causal constraint or cost is legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final reweighting is too delicate to satisfy the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: silent kingdom → king’s mandate → quill writes future → scroll becomes call-to-action. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s shadow flips from barrier to gateway, sunlight on the lake = undeniable social cost/promise. One minor causality wobble: the scroll of predictive models is introduced late yet never consulted or contradicted by the magical writing, so its narrative job is unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the glow-spread and lyric fragments intensify atmosphere rather than cause-and-effect. Closure is a Charged Poise—Clara’s stance crystallizes—but the cost is only implied (“quiet determination”). Orientation anchors by line 3, but the pirate signal’s origin and agency remain opaque, blurring causality. One meaningful tightening—the song slows for her pen—works texturally, not tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ash settling reweights the mask and chair, making impermanence legible with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each repetition of “mirage” and “shatter” deepens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael treasures the cog → Lira’s provocation → collapse threat → he surfaces. Orientation anchors by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ruin sunset re-weights the narratives as “threads in the same tapestry,” felt cost legible in Kael’s surrender of underground safety. The chronometer motif threads every beat, constraining his tactics (cannot abandon relics) and charging the final image with time reclaimed, not controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: “subtract noise” strategy → humming ritual → audience silence reconfigured. Orientation clean (who/where/when by line 3). Single scene, one tightening midpoint when hums lock; library transmuted into “living cathedral” is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—arts reclaimed in neglected space. No persistent personal price for Elara keeps it from 9-band, but closure lands cleanly under causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the image of glowing fruit ready to leave the greenhouse reconfigures the world’s possibilities with undeniable conceptual cost—Elara will now be the carrier of inconvenient wisdom. Causal chain holds: seed → celestial trigger → synaptic memories → fruit → shared future. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and again at transition to dawn. No lens ambiguity; the piece ends under Causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: box → key → staircase → orb → vision → surface revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s blackout is re-framed as protective sacrifice, felt cost is the drones’ death and Elara’s new burden of truth. One soft spot: the orb’s “danger too immense” is told, not foreshadowed, so the reprice feels slightly retroactive rather than seeded. Still, the lens holds (Causal) and the final image reweights premise with undeniable social cost—she must speak, and the city may not thank her.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the shard reweights perception and forecloses Elias’s former detachment, with a faint but legible conceptual cost (“the houses… whispering stories he was now ready to hear”). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each displaced object accrues meaning until the final hush crystallizes. However, the middle lacks a tightening beat that narrows options; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so the cost feels diffuse rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s stillness becomes a quiet guardianship of nuance, the garden’s silence now charged with meaning. The causal chain—warning → hesitation → adjusted serum—holds; the conceptual cost is the eternal stasis Liora accepts in exchange for guiding others. Orientation is swift; the underwater garden and telepathic statue are anchored by word 70. One minor loop: “time seemed to stand still” is echoed twice; otherwise beats advance knowledge or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a CR: the staircase rules reprice when Elara accepts irreversible loss as the price of perpetual motion; the three-spot die re-weights the premise. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of rolls + chalk equations tighten until the chipped die is lost and the remaining three re-casts the quest. No causality breaks; the staircase denies back-tracking without warning, a rule taught by the fallen die’s thunder. Cost is unmistakable: “she couldn’t retrieve it; the staircase would not allow her to retrace her steps.”

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight, brush, and canvas build density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—painting becomes bridge, greenhouse air re-prices from smog to jasmine; cost is felt in her spent wakefulness and the irrevocable shift from viewer to vessel. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no因果 breaks. Lacks a persistent constraint that later shapes tactics, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain: honey-bread → lens chime → crowd reawakening lands cleanly; the “after the beekeeper’s last visit” clock is announced early and honored. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—laughter in the grotto reweights memory itself, with no tidy exposition. Minor slack: the lens’s precise causal rules (why it chimes, what it demands) stay off-page, but the final image of emerald light on falling water crystallizes cost without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine holds: yoyo → hunger-stone interface → lighthouse inversion; closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the reversed gears, Elias’s tremble). A micro-turn occurs when the island “itself resisted,” tightening options. The only slack is that the stone’s rule-set is never constrained before it explodes, so the price feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior limits.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the funhouse fades and daylight returns, proving fear’s need for acknowledgment—a legible before/after shift with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is soft: the advisor nudges but Clara’s victory relies on sudden dream epiphany rather than because/therefore stakes tightening; the dream dictionary mechanics are asserted late, not earned through prior tactics. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within first 120 words. Drive lens is Hybrid: situational pressure inside shifting mirrors plus a final causal reveal; lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last swirl of clouds and the hush of sea re-weight the premise with felt aesthetic cost. Causality is loose-lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. The Orientation Test is waived; driftwood and blue-hour cues anchor by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens dominates: each beat (whistle sequence → crack → tunnel → chamber → new quest) is a because/therefore chain. Orientation is nailed by line 3 (“In the city of Valtara…”). Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elara leaves the chamber carrying the living shell and a mission that will expose her to the city’s collapse—price is legible in the shift from watcher-terror to watcher-ally. No prop teleport or timeline warp; mentor’s map pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal chain is present—letter → station → archive → revelation—but each link is thinly motivated. The ledger riddle and loose floorboard feel coincidental rather than earned; the archive discovery resolves the problem it did not help create. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“truth is a seed”), yet the cost is only asserted in the final paragraph. Orientation is clear; lens is Causal, but escalation is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing star-mosaic re-weights the pavilion from drowned ruin to charged vessel, and the inkwell note literalizes that re-pricing on the page. Causality is accumulative/textural—each artifact (journal, ink, mosaic) layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. One soft spot: the rising drawbridge is named twice but never constrains movement or time, so the external stakes feel symbolic rather than causal. Still, the lens holds and the cost (soaked clothes, raw hands, inherited tool now “heavier with purpose”) is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: blackout → isolation → stamp-triggered reveal. The map-readjustment beat supplies the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the city’s founding myth is rewritten. Orientation is anchored by 60 words; no disorientation serves closure, so the test is waived. Closure earns resonance because the stamp’s glow literalizes “honest origins,” but the library’s physical rules (how walls shift, why ink glows) are late-introduced magic; a hairline deduction for convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Kael’s release of the crane-shield reconfigures meaning and the island ascends—Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. Causal lens holds: because he keeps folding grief, therefore the basilica shows him the shield; because he unfolds it, therefore the island rises. Orientation supplied by ~80 words; transitions only one (bench → basilica) and is legible. No causality breaks, no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the crystal image reweights the stake and signals earned seeker identity. Causality is loose—perturbation theory is named late and never shapes tactics—so the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural rather than causal chain. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no caps triggered. Cost is felt but not materially demonstrated in a final action or forfeiture, keeping score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: pilgrim whisper → Kael arrives → drone finds glow → three-piece scavenger hunt → hologram. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“frequency of belonging” reweights the quest—but cost is abstract; no persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics. Lens stays situational/accumulative; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the watch hand swallowed by sand reweights his earlier theft and signals renunciation with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood carving thickens the pattern of erasure—yet the single-scene orientation is late (~140 words) and the causality between “sifting wood” and “I will lie no more” remains metaphorical rather than tactical, keeping the change evocative but not fully inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the drawer pull’s passage crystallizes a new joint stance under the waning moon, cost felt in Kael’s “I do not forgive lightly.” Causal lens holds: Elara’s recycled-mistake rhetoric directly enables Kael’s consent. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One scaffold paraphrase (“tonight is not about victory or defeat… it’s about untethering”) is allowed at this band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass is stowed, poles fade, and a “flicker of hope” reconfigures her stance with felt cost. Causality is intact: failed compass causes pole navigation causes new self-definition. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by sentence three. However, the single meaningful tightening is delivered in summary (“she no longer needed it”) rather than a dramatized beat, and the cost, while felt, is generalized—“backlash of regrets” remains abstract—keeping the story just below the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lost ball reweights “labyrinth” from abstract metaphor to lived circuitry—every past choice now glows in the dark. Causal lens holds: dropping the ball → following it → surfacing with altered stance; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clean within 120 words; cavern, post-procedure timing, and lone POV are anchored immediately. No plot amnesia; memory-wipe premise is respected—fragments trickle, never flood.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure is lyrical Charged Poise: orchard light and her glowing hands reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost (she must “embrace change within”). Causality is loose-associative, appropriate to Accumulative lens, but the fortune cookie drop is a deus-ex-prop that never constraints later choice; its “scent” cue is instantly fulfilled without friction. Orientation anchors arrive ~60 words—safe—yet the orchard’s spatial logic remains dream-float; distances and tree mechanics never guide a tactical decision. The lens holds, but the tightening is one soft epiphany rather than a narrowed path.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a soft, credible CR: the saucer-crack is re-valued from wound to reminder, with clear conceptual cost—time is irreparably fractured. Causal chain is present: missed ritual → glade → card-pull → saucer-light → reframe. Reflection stays within 20% and is anchored to present objects; however, the orientation anchor (where, when) is slightly late (~130 words) and the glade’s spatial rules remain fantastically vague, so the Orientation Test nudges −0.3. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—images accrete until the cadence shift of glowing crack; pattern is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine holds: because she performs shadow-work stitching, the portal opens; therefore she crosses. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—golden dimension mirrors her healed stance—priced by the ship’s recycled solitude continuing. Orientation is clear by word 60; the lens is Causal, held to the end. One soft spot: the “locked dimension” rule is declared, not dramatized, so the seal/unseal feels slightly convenient, keeping it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: releasing the bugs fuses personal symbol with cosmic alignment, reweighting the premise that transformation must be surrendered to, not climbed toward. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the hush thickens density until meaning crystallizes under the arch. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation serves the close, so no penalty. One minor scaffold: "the universe seemed to have other plans" telegraphs rather than enacts the detour; still, the final image pays off the pattern, satisfying the 7+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → cipher hunt → key → cradle → dawn. Orientation is clean by word 80; no penalty. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing—light now “warm, alive” and fort populace “stirred,” a visible social cost. Cost is collective rather than personal; Elara pays nothing tangible, so the price proof test is only half-met, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    A single causal spine—curse-vision → rock math → dust ignition—drives every beat; no teleporting props or knowledge. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world feels friction-less because Kael now senses the weave, a conceptual cost that re-prices normal effort. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from auroral color cadence to final pattern shift, each image tightening density rather than forcing external turns. Cost is palpable on-page: “the world felt different, as though friction itself had disappeared” makes the perceptual price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timer clicks and storm builds density until the map reweights identity. Closure is a Charged Poise—the first uncensored line—whose cost is felt in the same breath that peace is claimed. Causality is poetic rather than plot-based: envelope arrival is unexplained, but functions as mythic summons accepted by stance, not strategy. Orientation is swift; only the hometown bus schedule’s significance stays abstract, a minor waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain is loose: the sundial angles are never decoded on-page, so the final “revelation” lacks a tangible trigger. Closure arrives as a rhetorical flourish (“questions are the answers”) rather than a visible reconfiguration with cost. The half-painted sundial promises a geometry-driven turn that never materializes, breaking the set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts this self and pins his hope to the library walls, a visible forfeiture of perpetual escape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each poem painted adds density until the “glow” reweights the stake. Causality is loose (letters, tin, friendship arrive without trigger) but coherence is achieved through pattern: every fragment literally sticks to the walls. Cost is felt in the final image—“the library glowed”—a conceptual repricing that makes anarchy bearable art.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: the ticking clock and still compasses reweight meaning with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—reel appears on first mention, projector works instantly, film world spits her back without obstacle—yet the final image crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices at this length, but the reel’s deus-ex delivery keeps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    Causal chain is present—dream clue → climb → riddle → seed → plant → tree survives—but every causal node is narrated in summary, so pressure leaks out between beats. The orientation anchor (who/where) appears within the first 120 words, satisfying the test, yet the dream/seed logic is asserted rather than demonstrated, keeping the linkage thin. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (tree = saved memory), but no persistent constraint or price shapes tactics; the victory feels pre-ordained. A single meaningful tightening is present—the riddle moment—but it is rhetorical, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: letters dissolve, compass stills, color released—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (compass, lace, tide-borne letters) accretes meaning until the final cadence reweights the stake. Early orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words) and the single transition (porch→cove) is legible. Minor slack: causal links are poetic rather than sharp; he “understands” rather than chooses, so the Decisive Change is gentle, not irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with dust patterns intensifying in complexity until coalescing into a living butterfly—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights decay as generative. Cost is legible: the greenhouse remains ruined, but meaning shifts from loss to quiet creation. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when), and the single POV maintains coherence. The closure lands with resonant poise, though the transition from observation to manifestation lacks a decisive micro-choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: frost patterns, ledger fragments, and material caches build density toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is solid by line 30; the canyon, stars, and campfire anchor setting and timeline. The final grotto discovery delivers a Conceptual Repricing—truth revealed, apprentice located—with legible cost (ruined studio, captivity). However, the ambush’s mechanics and rival guild remain vague, softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and emotional layering until the dawn climax reweights silence as a canvas. Orientation is immediate: Elara, winterglass conservatory, post-Noise world. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—silence itself holds unshaken marvels—with felt cost in her abandoned quest for sound. The pattern of vibration → heat → color → melody tightens coherently to a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who, where, when) by line 3 and sustains a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and symbolic resonance build toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The lens reassembly functions as both literal task and metaphorical conduit, culminating in a Charged Poise ending where the city’s signal is heard—reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost (centuries of silence undone). One tightening occurs as Elias realizes the lens is incomplete, narrowing his goal. No causality breaks; the closure image (stars revealed) legibly reweights all prior stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated acts of giving build toward a communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bell’s final ring crystallizes shared identity and future intent, with felt cost in the community’s hollowed state and ongoing sanctions. The gathering functions as a decisive intensification, not just thematic echo. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and causality remains intact despite minimal external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: wisteria, sparks, breath, and pendant layer into a resonant crescendo. Orientation is immediate (“twilight,” “viaduct,” “Elara”), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—unused love resides within her now. Cost is legible: the burden of past failure transforms into purposeful compassion. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights time not as decay but as recoverable texture, with the restored photographs embodying undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via sensory thickening and recursive motifs (roots, fragments, geometry), culminating in the vortex vision. The pedestal activation is motivated by prior discovery, and the disintegration triggers irreversible change. One flaw: the hyperbolic geometry claim isn’t dramatized as a constraint, slightly weakening causal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: each beat links via because/therefore (e.g., because the liberator knows the piano code, they can find the vault). Orientation is strong by line 30 (who: chained liberator; where: abandoned carnival; when: hours before wall collapse). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the liberator stands free with seeds, reconfiguring the carnival from despair to hope. However, the chains’ magical disappearance at the end breaks causality—it’s a symbolic convenience that undermines the physical stakes established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara reconfigures the meaning of broken trust from wound to wisdom, with felt cost in the “resonant ache” that echoes through her being. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via color-sound motifs until the aurora-forged climax. Orientation is immediate (“sunken orchard greenhouse”), and the pattern of collecting absences tightens stakes without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the forge’s cooling and her trembling departure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira departs with purpose, the jar’s light mingling with moonlight, reconfiguring her identity without resolving all uncertainty. The causal chain—flower code → reinterpretation → revelation → transfer—is tight, with one meaningful deepening (the jar contains a soul, not just moonbeams). Cost is felt: she accepts emotional weight, not treasure. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the melting ice, glassblowing process, and recurring bookmark building density toward a Conceptual Repricing: safe spaces require embracing fragility. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the bookmark sealed in glass crystallizes Elara’s shift from silence to creation, with felt cost in abandoned control. Orientation is clear by line 3; the single scene coheres tightly. No causality breaks, though escalation relies more on lyrical accretion than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “You are what you choose to be” reweights identity with emotional cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring motifs (seashell, cast, mirrors)—but the causal link between decrypting notes and finding the key feels convenient. Timelessness works atmospherically but weakens narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map of endless night reweights reality itself, with cost legible in the vanished star and the fort’s humming walls. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each story deepens silence into cartography, tightening stakes until only one option remains. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; no causality breaks. Final image crystallizes the oracle’s irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until the violin’s melody triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: Unit-7 surrenders the instrument after gaining insight, and the “faint echo of a melody that would never truly fade” embodies enduring transformation. Orientation is solid by line 3; closure reweights the entire premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (ticket, lens, crystals) culminating in Charged Poise—hands clasped, objects offered, silence accepted. Cost is legible (“honesty they had both been afraid to share”) and the resonant hush crystallizes stakes. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 30. However, the climax hinges on a gesture without tactical consequence, slightly softening the closure’s causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the marbles’ polishing serving as a cadence-shifting ritual that deepens thematic weight. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights “cracks” as markers of survival, not failure, with clear emotional cost (acceptance of decay alongside beauty). The garden’s silent acknowledgment provides Charged Poise—options crystallize without action, yet the cost of lifelong doubt is felt. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality isn’t required under this lens, and none is broken.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean causal drive lens: Elara’s action (pulling the lever) directly triggers escalation (system failure), which forces a corrective choice (re-stabilizing the nexus). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the data proves her theory, but at the cost of station integrity and future peril—making the before/after legible. Orientation is strong early (who, where, when anchored by line 30), and the single-scene structure fits scope. However, the resolution leans slightly convenient; the mentor’s remembered advice functions as a deus ex machina that dilutes full ownership of the fix.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through water stains, silence, and liminal imagery until the melody triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost departs, Clara achieves peace, and the opera house regains resonance. Cost is legible—the antique program dissolves, symbolizing irrevocable loss of the artifact that enabled connection. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens, and escalation occurs via pattern intensification (water stains → sheet music → humming → rippling water). Closure lands with Charged Poise: Clara stands alone, forever changed, in a space now charged with memory.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and recursive imagery until the smudge becomes both rupture and revelation. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s acceptance of imperfect truth-making crystallizes options without neat resolution. Cost is legible in the “auroral sorrow” transforming into resilience—a conceptual and emotional price paid on the page. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear causal drive lens: Mara enters because of her father’s calls, finds the valve wheel, hears the ghost shift, and frees the souls. Orientation is solidly anchored by line 2 (“abandoned train tunnel,” “Mara,” present tense action). Closure is a Decisive Change—the machine activates, souls are released, weight lifts—but the cost is emotional only, with no tangible sacrifice or irreversible consequence beyond catharsis. The “ghost shift” premise resolves cleanly but lacks friction that would make the outcome feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira accepts impermanence, foreclosing her old detachment with felt cost (the library’s decay now “a reminder,” not a burden). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (swan, river, silence) until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the journals filled with unwritten entries and the refuge’s erasure. Minor deduction: the map’s sudden appearance borders on convenient, though its cryptic folds justify it just enough.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (curl, eclipse, roots) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: magic is redefined as perception, not spectacle. Closure lands with Charged Poise—the sun returns, but Finn’s worldview is permanently altered. Cost is legible in Finn’s abandoned telescope and Elara’s relinquished private relic now serving communal wonder. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: atmosphere, objects, and ideas layer toward a resonant reconfiguration (CR) at closure—the world dreams again. Orientation is strong early (silo library, Elara, post-dream era), and the ritual provides a causal spine within the accumulative frame. However, the climax is summarized rather than dramatized (“she closed her eyes… slowly the axis shifted”), robbing the decisive change of visceral tension. Cost is implied (centuries of silence) but not felt through Elara’s body or choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story lacks causal linkage: the microdot specs grant sudden omniscience without setup, and the lighthouse appears only in dreams with no spatial or temporal grounding. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) but cost is asserted, not shown—no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice. Orientation is clear early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous (Hybrid attempted, never stabilized), weakening escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the anchor’s silence shifts from muffled to understood, dissolving the possession by exposing its foundational assumptions. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through rhetorical loops and black-palette imagery until the final cadence shift reweights stillness as clarity. Cost is legible in the priest’s solitary endurance and the void he must inhabit. No causal breaks; orientation is functional despite early abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the writer’s act of whispering into the shell triggers the harp’s symphony, after which they collapse—but the mirrored horizon endures, reconfiguring meaning with palpable cost (exhaustion, surrender of control). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: memory mapping, dawn’s approach, and shell inscriptions build density until the cadence shift at the harp’s activation. Orientation is immediate (“glass spire by a frozen lake”), and causality flows via emotional pressure rather than plot mechanics. Cost is legible in the final image: the shell slips, the body slumps, yet the dream persists—felt sacrifice without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered selves and shifting runes until the closure crystallizes meaning. The labyrinth structure is taught early, transitions between shards are legible, and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost: Elara accepts multiplicity instead of seeking conquest. However, the “procedural generation” mechanic is named but never shown to constrain tactics, weakening causal integrity. The tablet’s dimming/brightening provides rhythmic escalation, but the drop/ripple timeframe lacks tangible pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps into the world reborn, not by regaining hearing but by embracing vibrational aliveness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory detail and reversed-song motif intensifies until the tear marks irreversible change. Cost is felt: years of isolation crystallize in that single tear. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality holds despite minor implausibility in phonograph tinkering.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: the message tube leads Elias to the quarantine zone, which explains the storms, culminating in his decision to act. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—he redefines integrity as action, not isolation, with felt cost (loss of sanctuary). However, the follower vanishes without consequence, creating a dangling thread that weakens causality. The ending lands with thematic weight but leaves one setup unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts grief rather than avoids it, with visible cost in years of emotional isolation now released. The mosaic structure (shop → greenhouse → hospital → backyard → shop) is taught early via the vial’s glow and transitions coherently under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the “crystal shadows... softening”—a resonant reconfiguration of his sanctuary’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time isn’t discovered but written—a resonant shift reweighting all prior action. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density builds via pattern recognition (rope, walls, beings), culminating in the mirror’s tripartite vision. Cost is legible in Elias’s relinquishment of the rope (symbol of past trauma/freedom) and his lighter step into uncertainty. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30, and the grotto’s logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence thickens, symbols accrue, and music builds density until the hush reconfigures into expectant stillness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the land exhales, Elara departs with purpose—carrying conceptual cost: she accepts imperfection as beauty. The mendicant’s bowl seeds and shapes this shift, and the greenhouse setting evolves causally with her actions. No causality breaks; pattern is taught early and paid off precisely at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights “half truths” from professional currency to existential necessity, with conceptual cost legible in Elara’s quiet satisfaction (“closest one could get to the whole”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory details (amber light, static hum) culminating in the petal’s dissolution, which crystallizes stakes without causal turns. Orientation anchors are immediate (“amber grotto at dusk”), and the transformation’s completion tightens pressure by forcing Elara’s decisive act. Cost proof: “joy, like all emotions, was transient” reframes Kael’s request with irreversible emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (locket, envelope, library) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end—two women recognizing shared lineage under stars. The mistaken envelope initiates the pattern, not resolves it, satisfying situational pressure rules. However, the symphony’s role is ornamental; time isn’t a live constraint, and the transition from concert hall to library lacks causal linkage, weakening structural cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs—the arbor, Echo’s tags, marsh-reed sculptures—until the final tag on Lira’s sculpture crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: Lira’s luminescent ache softens only after months of searching, implying time, emotional labor, and vulnerability. Orientation is flawless by line 3 (“crystalline orchard… Lira worked silently”), and causality remains intact via motivated ellipsis—each shard of Echo’s art deepens her understanding. The closure lands with conceptual weight: belonging is woven, not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time is recast from river to tapestry, with cost felt in Mara’s relinquishment of control. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (pendant, canal, cadence) until the final reweighting. Orientation is clear by line 3; the giant’s nap functions as a taught temporal constraint. The staircase descent and pool encounter dramatize the turn without summary, though the transition into the cavern risks slight elision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each discovery (glass eyes → mosaic alignment → journal → synthesis) follows a motivated chain of inquiry. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that emotion’s mathematics is about harmony, not control—which reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (the peril of tampering acknowledged, yet transcended). The orchard’s brighter glow provides resonant, non-literal payoff. Cost is legible: Elara inherits her mentor’s burden and risks his fate, yet chooses to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dweller reconfigures invisibility into purposeful visibility, with conceptual cost felt in their cached memories lifting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory fragments builds to a cadence shift at dawn. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality is maintained through methodical discovery. However, the tape’s “humming to life” borders on convenient magic without prior mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s stance shifts from resistance to acceptance, the nursery reconfigured as “a living, breathing entity,” with felt cost in her drenched, lighter frame and dissolved leaf. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory rain, plant whispers, and spatial rearrangement until the final sunlight image reweights control as surrender. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the leaf’s dissolution and her relinquished order.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s role shifts from painter to keeper of stories, reweighting her entire artistic premise with undeniable cost—the surrender of personal expression for custodianship. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through sensory density (rain trails, bioluminescence, amber warmth) that crescendos into thematic revelation. The map and brooch function as coherent patterned artifacts, not deus ex machina. Cost is legible in the charged poise of her final brushstroke—no longer chasing shadows but channeling archived truth.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cave’s music intensifies, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where magic is redefined as immanent in the ordinary. Closure lands with Charged Poise—Elara steps out transformed, the pearl’s essence a “silent promise”—and cost is legible in her relinquished need for foresight. However, the inciting touch of the pearl feels coincidental rather than earned, and the “unseen forces” resolve tension without prior causal groundwork, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elara’s final note reconfigures the harbor from ruin to promise, with felt cost in her isolation and inherited duty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns of water, symbols, and sound intensify toward resonance. Early anchors (Ivory Harbor, post-rain, exile’s end) orient cleanly. The valve’s activation and the woman’s appearance feel motivated by prior sensory deciphering, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating symbolic density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the fortress dissolves, revealing that maps are made of courage, not ink. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the safety of known paths is irrevocably surrendered—and the shifting symbols, arrows, and mirrors cohere into a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30; the lens is taught early via the phantom punch’s uncanny properties and holds through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns deepen through sensory and symbolic layering until the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the tile’s magic reframes memory, connection, and cosmic harmony—with felt cost in Elara’s surrendered solitude. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the whale migration anchors time meaningfully. Yet the escalation relies on passive discovery rather than active pressure, softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story opens with immediate orientation: Elyr, immortal, in the prismatic escondite—anchored by vivid sensory cues within 50 words. Causality follows a tight Accumulative/Textural lens: the solar storm unearths the fragment, which Elyr manipulates via magnetic fields, escalating pressure until reality fractures. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the void becomes a “spark of purpose,” reconfiguring his eternal stance with palpable cost (the mutiny’s irreversible chaos). The final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution, satisfying all closure criteria with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Clara’s handling of the ink pot triggers a perceptual shift that enables her confrontation with her father, which in turn alters their trajectory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): they walk out together, foreclosing the path of lies with visible emotional cost. The funeral home setting and ink pot are causally integrated, not decorative. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits the scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the hum’s intensification serving as a pattern-break that reweights stakes. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara carries the forest’s silence into the waking world, crystallizing her role as keeper. Cost is felt—the trembling hands, the intensity—but not visibly paid; still, the final image makes conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: fragments coalesce into thematic resonance rather than causal chain. Orientation is strong by line 30 (who: nameless wanderer; where: shipping container labyrinth; when: present, tide-governed). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that “the act of remembering itself” constitutes memory’s texture—with conceptual cost (lives poisoned by neglect). The archive discovery deepens stakes, but escalation relies on revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure, slightly softening the tightening required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and recurring motifs until the cello’s hum triggers a Conceptual Repricing: the riddle is to be lived, not solved. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the abandonment of proof-seeking—and the final image (wind carrying her “into the whisper of closing pages”) crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of memory-as-navigation pays off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: graffiti patterns build density toward the Festival climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the stone placement crystallizes communal identity with conceptual cost (resisting erasure). However, key beats like Lira’s decoding process are summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal pressure. The timeline (“before privatization”) sets stakes but lacks a live clock that tightens decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures past dawn despite mission control’s calls, foreclosing timely extraction with visible cost (risking terraforming arrival). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and patterned motifs (hourglass, dawning hush), culminating in a Charged Poise where legacy outweighs protocol. The chemical message’s timing is causally sound within established lore. Cost is legible in her clenched fist and the fading summit.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through sensory density and recurring motifs (water, mist, hummingbird). Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elara’s restored drone harmonizes with the depot’s sounds as the ship departs, crystallizing her role as a quiet anchor in motion. Cost is legible—the traveler’s relief confirms emotional weight—and the final image reconfigures repair as spiritual stewardship. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the river’s hidden source reweights Elara’s lifelong quest from cartographic precision to embodied witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the condensation pattern, falcon’s return, thinning ice all layer into a resonant final image. Cost is legible: decades of intellectual pursuit culminate in silent acceptance, foreclosing further searching. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact despite lyrical pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through rhythmic repetition and sensory layering. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell’s chime signals restored harmony, and Elias’s earned stasis as guardian feels legible. However, the cost is implied rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, exhaustion, or irreversible loss grounds the renewal. The rhythm deepens, but escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or knowledge shift that would push this into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (“gathered hush,” “ephemeral”) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: Maya revalues solitude as sacred rather than isolating. But causality falters—the vial’s power appears deus ex machina, with no prior rules established. The cave-in creates stakes, yet resolution hinges on passive receptivity, not active escalation. Cost is implied (abandoned distress signal) but never viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elias descends because he seeks truth; learns the hush consumes seekers; chooses to reject it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he stands at the threshold, no longer defined by his father’s lie, with the lighthouse behind him as challenge, not prison. Cost is legible—the three vanished guards are offerings he refuses to repeat—and the journal revelation directly motivates his ascent. Orientation is solid by line 30, and causality holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic resonance until the bead’s glow triggers a Charged Poise closure: the greenhouse shifts from prison to threshold, and hope emerges amid collective sorrow. Cost is legible in the “mournful elation” and the unspoken price of confronting others’ pain. However, the inciting incident (bead’s awakening) feels slightly abrupt—its mechanics aren’t grounded in prior cause, leaning on atmospheric buildup over causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (plate, orchids, sleepwalking paths) until the canyon transforms—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is legible: Elara’s labor and solitude, though abstract, are felt through atmospheric shift from sorrow to hope. However, the lack of a decisive narrowing of options or tangible sacrifice limits escalation; transformation occurs via lyrical accretion, not causal pressure. Closure lands coherently but without visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (roots, bones, sundial) until the tomb’s discovery crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“catacomb orchard,” “Elara,” “diaspora returnee”). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elara’s placement of the sundial base reconfigures past/present with conceptual cost (centuries of fracture overcome). No causality breaks; the pattern is taught early and pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pattern recognition builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the letter reweights the past as urgent and meaningful. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who/where/when). However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening; the chalk clue leads directly to the mailbox without obstacle or cost. The ending offers CR with conceptual cost (remembering what’s lost), but no felt or visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because the flame pulses, Elara notices shifting constellations; therefore Lira arrives; because they synchronize, the chart reveals a path. Closure is Charged Poise—the completed tapestry crystallizes their mission, with the cost being the loss of innocence about the coup’s true nature. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who: Elara; where: cobalt observatory; when: autumn twilight, pre-coup). The only flaw: Lira’s entrance borders on convenient, though her dialogue retroactively justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s act of reading the unsent letter transforms it from burden to bridge, with felt cost implied in her long silence and the spirits’ hush. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through layered messages, condensation maps, and intensifying shard-light until the final crystallization. Cost is legible in the “fierce tenderness” that replaces years of absence. The structure teaches its lyric logic early and pays off every motif without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ocean’s song becomes a reweighted symbol of resilience, charged by Elara’s decryption work. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory layering and recurring motifs until the final line crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the anesthetic’s fading numbness and the child’s vanished presence. Orientation is anchored cleanly by 120 words; no causality breaks or disorientation penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira reclaims her artistic purpose through action, not declaration, with visible emotional cost (tears, months of disuse). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the fog, film, and light accumulate into a charged final image. Time’s fluidity (“within the fold of a daydream”) serves the lens and pays off at closure. Minor deduction: the knowledge network’s sudden functionality lacks prior causal setup.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sound-wave density intensifying until Elara’s hum triggers transformation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: art isn’t permanent but alive through participatory curiosity, with the cost being her certainty. The garden’s “pause between question and reply” crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, stakes legible. No causality breaks; every escalation stems from sensory accumulation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes stakes (“stand together… against the encroaching darkness”) with felt cost (infiltration, imminent danger). The Causal lens holds—Elias’s deciphering triggers Krane’s reveal, which escalates to urgent mobilization. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who/where/when). Minor deduction: the greenhouse “warping” feels atmospheric rather than causally integrated into the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated lullabies, fraying postcard, and deepening resonance within the shell create density that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing—“blossom armistice” reweights pain as harmonious rather than something to overcome. Orientation is clear by line 30; the shell, poet, and postcard anchor time/place effectively. Closure lands with Charged Poise: the poet steps out transformed, the shell exhales gratitude, and stars “wink”—a resonant reconfiguration with implied emotional cost (years of insomnia, worn postcard). Yet the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where sensory density and recurring motifs (wind chime, Vessel, glass orchids) intensify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes part of the library’s memory. Closure lands with undeniable cost—her heart heavy yet triumphant—and the shattered chime marks irreversible change. Orientation is flawless by line 30, and the echo-to-song progression tightens pressure organically. The only hairline flaw: the museum’s sudden appearance lacks transitional cueing, slightly marring seamlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the symphony’s glow reconfigures their relationship with undeniable emotional cost (months of silence, fractured mentorship). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via layered promises that deepen thematic density, not causal chain. Inkwell activation hinges on earned interior shifts, not coincidence. Cost is legible in Kael’s sorrow-hope expression and Elara’s lightened heart—a resonant before/after crystallized in the archive’s awakened voices.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal undertones), building pressure through sensory density and symbolic accretion until Elias’s Charged Poise at the amphitheater’s center crystallizes options into a workable compromise. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—is legible: he endures doubt to forge unity, with cost felt in his tremors and the villagers’ relief. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“dormant volcano,” “Elias,” “surveyor’s chain”). Minor deduction for the envelope’s adhesive analysis functioning as near-exposition rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the dust motes’ evolving patterns serving as both motif and map. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s realization that “the dust was not chaos but a map” reweights her entire enterprise, crystallizing options with felt cost—the surrender of protective lies. The inciting letter (“The songs are in the dust”) functions as a pattern-break that tightens pressure without coincidence resolving conflict. Anchors (attic, skylight, pigeons) are clear by line 30, satisfying orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights the meaning of thresholds from mystery to sacrifice, with clear conceptual cost (accepting her father’s necessary departure). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—light, memory, and codes layer until the final insight crystallizes. Orientation is strong by line 3 (“drifting prism terrace,” “Elara,” “after the butterfly effect”). The logbook’s late-revealed code functions as a patterned intensification, not a deus ex machina, because it emerges from prior tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines belonging not as location but as attunement, crystallized in the Charged Poise of her final glance at the fireflies. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through light motifs until the sunrise pierces the dome, making cost legible (abandoning the symphony she briefly joined). The alarm provides coherent pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira accepts that paths disappear to be rediscovered, crystallizing her stance with emotional cost—the memory remains fleeting, yet she finds peace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; patterns in glass and seeds accrue meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the vanishing path and her earned lightness. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality flows via emotional density, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias’s act builds density through mirrored movements until starlight crystallizes meaning at closure. Orientation is immediate (“tidal arcade,” “Elias,” “tonight”), and the climax delivers a Conceptual Repricing—randomness reweighted as art—with felt cost (his exile from monotony). One tightening suffices: the bishop’s convergence with the skylight forecloses passivity. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira’s outstretched arm reconfigures silence into defiance, with conceptual cost (erasure risk) made legible in the glowing verse. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory gaps, starlight ink, and garden rhythm—and intensifies cleanly to the sentinel’s pause. Orientation is immediate (“twilight garden,” “Lira”), and causality holds despite lyric design. The sentinel’s retreat feels earned by the verse’s power, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of light, water, and mist build toward a Conceptual Repricing—Elias resees the bay and himself as a “keeper of light.” Closure lands via Charged Poise: his crystallized purpose is legible, though the cost remains abstract (no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path). Orientation is clear by line 2, and the single scene adheres to scope. However, the “shift coming” lacks concrete stakes or consequence, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure escalating through sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights his pain from burden to bridge, with clear cost in the scars that “glow faintly” and the relinquished isolation. The moonlit ridge setting and porcelain box function as taught motifs that converge meaningfully at the end. No orientation issues; anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns intensify, the tide’s rhythm deepens pressure, and the final realization reweights everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—hope as lived pattern, not solvable equation—with clear cost in the erasure of her designs. Time and place are anchored early; the grotto’s fluid temporality serves the closure. One tightening (tide threatening patterns) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: walls dream not of the past but of being remembered, reweighting the entire premise. The film strip’s transformation from talisman to key, paired with the mirror-window, delivers undeniable conceptual cost—her purpose shifts from extraction to stewardship. Causality is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory detail builds toward the resonant final image. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and sensory layering until the mirrors’ transformation crystallizes as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost—Elara’s fading heartbeat—is legible in the final image (“her hands trembled slightly,” “borrowed heartbeat ticking away”). Orientation is clear by line 3, and the bell-timed structure tightens pressure without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density (jasmine, celestial bodies, ink-stained clipboard) intensifies toward a Charged Poise closure where silence reconfigures meaning. The ancient terrace anchors orientation early, and the treaty signing delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (“peace was fragile, imperfect, and precious”). Yet the negotiation’s off-stage progression (“hours turned into days”) softens causality; the pivotal shift hinges on Elara’s monologue rather than earned dialogue-driven turns, weakening pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rain after burial reweights Elara’s entire enterprise from exploitation to fragile redemption, with the cost legible in her isolation and vulnerability. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring salt, cracks, and silence until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“vast salt flat,” “Elara Voss”), and the single-scene structure holds. Minor deduction for the manufactured drought’s causality being off-stage, slightly weakening linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory and symbolic layering until the sanctuary opens—a Conceptual Repricing closure where the city’s awakening reweights the premise of passive peace. Orientation is immediate: “silver courtyard under snow,” Elara’s role, and her mission are anchored by line 30. The final image—snow carrying echoes—makes the cost undeniable: complacency is shattered, and Elara’s identity is irrevocably altered. Every beat tightens around the central act of untangling, culminating in a resonant, earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory density and recurring motifs (stick, dome, puppets) until a cadence shift at dawn crystallizes purpose. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias reweights his storytelling ethics—but the cost remains abstract (no forfeited relationships, venues, or tools). Orientation is clear by line 3; however, the argument’s stakes are summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shifts (e.g., “interrupted cadence,” monarch absence) deepening thematic pressure. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elara’s spiral structure crystallizes memory and loss, with the moth and monarch wings reconfiguring transience into resilience. Cost is felt in the silence of missing butterflies—a conceptual and emotional void—but the stakes never narrow into a decisive fork; the ending resonates without foreclosing a path. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic resonance until the melody erupts—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence as potential music. Orientation is immediate: “icebound sanctum,” Elara, aurora—all anchored by line 3. The closure lands with undeniable cost: Elara finds her own name among the forgotten, implying reconciliation with loss. No causality breaks; the rope’s glow follows logically from reweaving, and the aurora’s pulse mirrors her effort without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: symbols intensify, light shifts, storm builds, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (paths choose walkers via resonance). Closure lands with felt cost—wafer seal dissolves, mission ends—but the “decisive change” is purely internal with no foreclosed option or tangible sacrifice. Orientation is strong early; however, the climax’s insight feels declared rather than dramatized through prior causal steps.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the inciting discovery (tile in courtyard) relies on passive luck—brushing a hidden compartment—not causal pressure or character-driven alignment. The “deciphering” in the observatory is summarized, not dramatized, weakening escalation. Cost is conceptual (“devotion and sacrifice”) but never rendered as tangible loss or irreversible choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Situational lens: pressure crystallizes Kael’s stance without causal escalation. Closure is Earned Stasis—he accepts grace—but the cost is abstract (“carry the weight of your resentment forever”) with no on-page forfeiture or tangible tradeoff. The sanctuary’s reality-bending premise isn’t leveraged to constrain choices; it functions as a mood backdrop. Orientation is clear early, but the lack of meaningful tightening (one dialogue exchange resolves everything) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands at the threshold, boundaries thinned but not erased, with the cost being the surrender of either/or thinking. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—fog, breath, glass, and light accrue meaning until the final image reweights “boundaries” as permeable. Time blurs organically, reinforcing thematic dissolution without causality breaks. Every beat tightens toward the climactic alignment of breath, instrument, and vision.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara redefines mending as creation from fragments, not restoration. The “deciduous vow” concept crystallizes into action with visible cost—her enduring regret—and the final image (glowing ribbon in tree) makes before/after legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the compass’s sentience borders on convenient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: motifs deepen, perception sharpens, and the cameo’s meaning accrues until the bathroom breakthrough crystallizes the theme. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the orchard is “her destiny”—with legible cost in the form of lifelong disquiet now embraced as purpose. However, the woman’s appearance verges on deus ex machina; her exposition resolves mystery without Elara earning it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (diary → chrono-blossom → library) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara gains knowledge but accepts balance-preserving terms. However, the labyrinth’s resistance feels decorative, not causally integrated, and Kael’s urgency (“time is collapsing”) isn’t dramatized as a tightening constraint—it vanishes after setup.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory decay and narrative threads to reweight the stake of memory. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the garden is revealed as a state of being, not a place, with cost legible in Elara’s acceptance of incompleteness. However, the transition from reading threads to the mist-door lacks causal linkage—it’s associative, not pressured. The foggy bay and ship are well-anchored early, avoiding orientation penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (seal, rope, door, chimes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the “fables of absence” become recoverable stories. The closure is resonant and earned, with a felt shift from confusion to clarity. However, the causal link between reconfiguring the rope and unlocking the door relies on unexplained magical logic, creating a slight softness in escalation despite strong atmospheric cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: arrival of chaos → quest for bloom → activation → resolution. Orientation is immediate and vivid, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—is on-page, decisive, and carries felt cost (Lira’s weariness, the caves’ restored song). The inferred lens is Causal, held consistently, with each beat motivating the next. No causality breaks or retroactive patches mar the progression.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “coincidence” as “thread in a tapestry,” transforming chaos into pattern with felt cost (erased memories). The Causal lens holds—each action follows from prior knowledge (texts → stars → sacrifice). Orientation is immediate (“glass humming pavilion… Elara, the beacon-tower custodian”), and escalation tightens via the ritual’s memory price. Cost is legible in the fading memories and the prism’s reformation, though the shard’s mechanics border on deus ex machina without deeper constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring images (shadows, fog, crystals), and cadence shifts build toward a Charged Poise closure—Elara’s quiet resolve to keep listening. Cost is felt in the “deepening hush in her heart,” implying emotional burden, though it’s conceptual rather than dramatized through action. Orientation is clear by line 3; the pattern of memory-as-environment is taught early and pays off cohesively. However, the climax relies on passive reception rather than earned causality, slightly undercutting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress shifts from symbol of decay to beacon, with visible cost in the people’s hollow eyes now alight—a Charged Poise where hope is rekindled but fragility remains. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chants, light, mosaic build density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the smoldering rag knot—light persists, but effort endures.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights her method not as deviation but as essential cartography of time’s texture, crystallized in the cicada’s transformed carvings. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases via layered temporal fragments (laughter, storm, whisper), culminating in a cadence shift where the cicada’s hum syncs with her heartbeat. Cost is legible: her earlier isolation and Kael’s criticism are reframed as necessary pauses. The grotto’s silence evolves from setting to participant, charging the final image without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: silence textures deepen until the inversion climax reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“bunker builder’s claustrophobic child,” “xenial trellis above the clouds”). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara returns changed, the gilded hush now powerless—carrying conceptual cost (she can’t un-know true silence). The gravity-inversion premise risks whimsy but pays off because it’s treated as literal cause, not metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building silence as both setting and emotional medium. Closure arrives via Earned Stasis: Mira achieves internal calm, and Elias reaffirms his purpose—both legible with felt cost (Mira’s prior anxiety, Elias’s stewardship burden). The storm glass catalyzes the central turn, and the train whistle’s echo frames the temporal cadence. No causality breaks, though the emotional shift leans slightly on assertion (“for the first time in weeks”) rather than fully embodied unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: each discovery (murals → waterfall cavern → archway) logically enables the next. Orientation is immediate (“hidden orchard,” “lore keeper Lira”), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the throne isn’t for claiming but understanding—with legible conceptual cost (abandoning individual power). The ruby flake’s consistent behavior and timed sunrise frame ensure no causality breaks. Only minor deduction: the stairway ascent lacks tangible obstacles, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira severs a scar-bond to stabilize the threshold, paying a tangible emotional price that forecloses a path (reconnection with that soul). The causal chain—darkness encroaches → ring activated → scar sacrificed—is tight, with stakes signaled early and pressure escalating coherently. Cost is legible in the cracked ring and “hollow ache.” Orientation is clear by line 20, and the Situational lens (pressure forcing crystallized stance) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “quantum promise” becomes tangible, reweighting Elara’s worldview with hope-as-diamonds. However, the portal transition and machine activation rely on coincidence (glitchy texts, bolt fitting perfectly) rather than causally earned steps. Cost is implied (“pressures of her past”) but not dramatized—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Lens reads Hybrid (Causal/Textural), but escalation leans on external cues over protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory density and recurring motifs building toward a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty’s curse is internal, not external. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Eleanor’s quiet acceptance reconfigures her role from ender to keeper, with felt cost in lost legacy. The bridge vision functions as a taught pattern, not disorientation, so no Orientation Test penalty applies. However, the transition to the bridge lacks causal scaffolding—it feels like dream logic rather than earned escalation, slightly weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Alaric redefines allegiance as commitment to possibility, crystallizing options with visible cost (abandoning knight identity). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns intensify until the marionette-without-strings image reweights reality. Orientation anchors instantly (“alchemical orchard greenhouse”), and the murmured phrase pays off causally. Cost is legible in the vanished program and lighter air.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s choice to write reconfigures the room from “sorrow” to “sanctuary,” with conceptual cost in the unsent letter and unkept promise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the dust patterns, button, ribbon, and letter accrue meaning toward this shift. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the cause/effect chain (button → name → letter → narrative act) tightens stakes coherently. Cost is legible in Clara’s sacrifice and Liam’s unknowing loss.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because she deciphers the map, therefore she enters the lagoon; because enforcers arrive, therefore she broadcasts. Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure is Charged Poise—Mara vanishes into rebellion, reconfiguring her role from ghost to beacon—but the cost (capture? loss of physical archive?) remains abstract, weakening the felt stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs (broadcast over escape), satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy dissolves, the grotto exhales, and tranquility returns—but at the cost of the saxophonist’s effort and lingering solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, moss, and atrium evolve in resonance with the melody, culminating in a decisive cadence shift. Orientation is strong by line 3 (who, where, when). However, the “prophecy” remains vague, weakening causal specificity in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual, seed-sorting, and monument-making until the moonstone speck triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elara stands transformed, with new purpose legible in the final image. However, the inciting discovery lacks causal friction—the speck appears without obstacle, and no path is foreclosed. Cost is implied (“something had shifted forever”) but never embodied or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tinkerer redefines time not as something to control but to celebrate, with clear conceptual cost—he relinquishes his lifelong identity as a fixer of clocks. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through recurring images (swirling leaves, erratic needle) that cohere into pattern, not randomness. Every beat flows because of prior texture, and the final act (crafting a new device) crystallizes this shift without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coin’s meaning shifts from mystery to personal emblem, reweighting “names” as active choices, not labels. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—visions layer into thematic density, culminating in a crystallized final image (stars as “fragments of a greater whole”). Cost is legible in softened regret and ongoing search. Structure tightens once via furnace entry, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s final climb into dawn light reconfigures her purpose with visible cost—the ache in her chest, the spent relic—and the gorge’s approval signals earned transformation. The causal chain is clean: pursuit → listening → confession → release → integration. Orientation is immediate (“hidden sunrise,” “Echo Gorge,” “Elara”), and the single-scene structure fits scope. Minor deduction: the soul’s backstory arrives as exposition rather than dramatized memory, softening causality’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic recurrence until the final Conceptual Repricing crystallizes: mercy isn’t formulaic but relational to pain’s purpose. Orientation is immediate (“ultraviolet forest,” “anesthesia”), and the closure—mask sinking, light enveloping—carries undeniable emotional cost. The forest-as-mirror motif pays off cohesively, with the disorientation of emergence resolving into rootedness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reclaimed narrative reweights forgotten histories as worthy of light. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory detail and recurring motifs until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is conceptual (buried stories restored) but legible in the fragment’s fading glow. However, the map discovery feels slightly convenient, leaning on coincidence rather than earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s repair seals the cracks and releases the ghosts, offering Earned Stasis for Marcus. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds sensory and spectral density until the mainspring insertion triggers reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the fading whispers and healed façade, implying emotional release rather than tangible loss. Orientation is immediate and maintained; causality flows through object-based ritual, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: frost patterns, bottled whisper, and cloud voices layer into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is Charged Poise—Elara returns with new understanding, the library now alive, her role crystallized. Cost is conceptual: she abandons rigid order for malleable truth, legible in the final image of her smiling at the humming press. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality flows through pattern recognition, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the civilization’s truth is validated, reweighting Elara’s entire worldview with undeniable cost—her unhealed wounds despite external vindication. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (shard, mirrors, light storms), culminating in a cadence shift at the storm’s peak. Orientation is immediate (“baroque asteroid, Zahir-7...”), and causality holds—her ritual directly triggers the vision. Cost is legible in the final whisper: “even the most broken things could still hold light.”

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “mending what isn’t torn” redefines restoration as truth-reclamation, with visible cost—the spent philosopher’s stone chip, now dull. The Causal lens holds: each discovery (tether, map, covenant) follows from Elias’s skilled action. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“village of Elmsworth… workshop in oak roots”). The riddle pays off precisely at climax, with no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building sensory and conceptual density until the lagoon reconfigures reality itself. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the world above is “smaller now,” while mystery becomes infinite. Cost is legible—the compass is lost, and Elara relinquishes tangible proof for intangible truth—and the grandfather’s note pays off cleanly without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns intensify (slide pulses → chamber lights → merged map), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—Mara reweights her art as intergenerational stewardship. Orientation is strong by line 30 (who, where, when anchored). Closure lands with conceptual cost: she accepts a legacy that demands lifelong service, though the physical/emotional toll remains abstract. A tighter link between her driftwood practice and the ancestral carvings would deepen causality.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory and emotional density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—“flowers bloom at night because even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be seen.” Cost is legible in the weight of history and personal sacrifice (time, solitude, emotional labor), crystallized in the mural’s completion. However, the journey lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses a live alternative; Elara never faces a real choice that risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story lacks causal escalation: the lagoon figure appears coincidentally after Elara’s ritual, not because of a chain of motivated choices. The closure is a Charged Poise (hope replaces doubt), but cost is vague—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Orientation is clear early (zeppelin, dunes, diary), yet the Drive Lens is ambiguous; it flirts with Accumulative/Textural but defaults to Situational without coherent pressure forcing irreversible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s departure crystallizes her stance—creation over replication—with the cove reborn and the bottle vanished. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lanterns, light, laughter accumulate to reweight the ghost town into life. Cost is legible in the bottle’s disappearance and her refusal to stay—a conceptual price for her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s declaration crystallizes her role as inheritor, fulfilling the garden’s purpose with conceptual cost (she now bears its memory). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of symbols, silence, and sensory detail reweights the stake at sunset. The foghorn’s absence isn’t coincidence but a taught pattern that pays off. Every beat tightens toward the orchard’s sigh of relief, making before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “borrowed time” shifts from abstract inheritance to tangible responsibility, with the final image of wild serenity reweighting decay into renewal. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (acorn cap, feather, vortex) culminating in thematic resonance. Cost is felt implicitly in Elara’s solitude and burden, though not dramatized as concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and patterned stillness until the bell’s ring crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the rope isn’t a relic but a conduit—and cost is legible in Elias’s irreversible shift from technician to “keeper.” The Orientation Test passes cleanly by line 3 (“Elias… storm siren tester… windblown sanctuary above the clouds”). Zero hour lands as revelation, not storm, fulfilling the thematic promise with resonant, earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (lantern, falling stars, cleaning) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: stillness as generative. Closure lands via Earned Stasis—Lira endures and integrates the lantern’s lesson, foreclosing her prior spiritual restlessness. Cost is legible in the lantern’s dimming and her quiet relinquishment of its guidance. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-shard structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory fragments, symbols, and whispers accrue until the ritual crystallizes meaning. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s Earned Stasis as guardian—charged by the ghosts’ dissolution and the oasis’s renewal. However, the box opening “though he had no memory of touching it” introduces unmotivated magic that slightly undermines causality under this lens. Cost is felt (his solitude redefined) but not viscerally rendered in a specific image or sentence at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with patterned imagery (urn fragment, chronometer symbols) building toward a Conceptual Repricing: time regains rhythm not through force but restoration of memory and connection. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the silo hums, Elara feels belonging, and the urn fragment reweights the entire narrative as a vessel of timeless bonds. Cost is legible in the silo’s prior instability and Elara’s isolation, now replaced by purpose and partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the kite’s ascent reweights their understanding of brokenness, with cost felt in the wanderer’s reclaimed attention and the poet’s shared vulnerability. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (feather, kite, “woven dawns”) until the final image crystallizes meaning. The inciting snap of the string cleanly initiates pressure, and the single scene holds spatial and temporal coherence. No causality breaks, though the wanderer’s arrival borders on contrivance without undermining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (copper wire, diary, stone pillars) deepen into revelation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—Elias reframes the orchard as communal legacy, not personal domain. Orientation is immediate and stable. Closure lands with conceptual cost: his mortality forecloses future stewardship, yet his act reweights human-nature relations. No causality breaks; every discovery flows from tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “chemistry of homecoming” shifts from solvable formula to felt experience, reweighting all prior inquiry. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density via recurring motifs (amber, footprints, tower) until the summit crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Elara’s softened skepticism, a visible surrender of her defining trait. Orientation is clear by line 30; pattern taught early and paid off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (seed pods, bird calls, twilight) that deepen thematic weight. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the jetty shifts from symbol of loss to testament of hope, with cost implied in the coachman’s solitude and the dead reef. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern is taught early. The final image reweights all prior material without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (leaf, grooves, distance/closeness) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the wasteland reframed as a site of connection. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is maintained through Elias’s active choices. The closure image—walking together under the leaf’s glow—carries conceptual cost (abandoning isolation) without over-explaining. Every beat tightens the thematic coil toward this earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (compass rose, stars, sketching) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: true north as dynamic, not fixed. Closure lands with Charged Poise—Elara’s resolve crystallizes options without physical action, and the cost (isolation, burden of vision) is legible in the final image. However, the “shutdown” backstory arrives too late to shape present tactics, and the tightening lacks a decisive narrowing of choices—pressure accumulates but doesn’t constrict. Orientation is clear by line 30, satisfying early anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Kael ascends because the sky is wrong, solves trials because he must, and wins by playing chess because that’s the spire’s test. Orientation is immediate and stable. Closure is a Decisive Change—the sky heals—with conceptual cost implied in regained wonder. However, the chess game resolves too neatly; the “unseen opponent” lacks resistance, making the climax feel like ritual rather than earned struggle. The pocket sundial lid’s true function is revealed without prior clues, risking retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (whispers, pawns, walking) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the interregnum’s uncertainty reframed as generative potential. The closure—a Charged Poise where Elara departs transformed yet unresolved—is legible, with cost felt in her relinquishment of performed identities. Orientation is strong by line 30; causality is maintained through sensory and symbolic continuity. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; every beat accrues meaning toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (feather, stone, thunder) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: home as internal harmony, not place. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“labyrinthine bookstore that occupied an entire mountain”), and closure lands with felt cost—the relinquishing of escape via reality-substitution for integrated selfhood. The “hidden thunder” crescendo effectively reweights stakes, though the transition from discovery to epiphany compresses psychological causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara exits with steady hands and resolve, having foreclosed the path of perpetual self-punishment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (frayed threads, platinum reflections) until the labyrinth’s message crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in her relinquished guilt and altered posture. Orientation is clear by line 30; time-frozen village and thunder lull functionally disorient then resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: Lira’s poetry intensifies, the mist refracts, echoes multiply, and the spire awakens—all building density until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: “Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal.” Cost is legible in the surrender of a “shard of her heart,” made undeniable by the dissolving shadows and parted mist. Orientation is strong from the first sentence (“towers of bone… canyon of endless echoes”), and the single-scene structure adheres perfectly to 600–800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (pockmarks, charm, acid sea). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights brokenness as strength, with cost implied in the workshop’s fragility and the fleeting memories. However, the “dire enchantment” surge and statue activation rely on unexplained mechanics, creating a minor causality gap at the climax that slightly undermines the otherwise coherent pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and reflective beats that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: eternity as a fleeting moment. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the detour functions as a taught pattern that pays off in closure. Cost is legible in Elara’s emotional shift (“heart lighter”) and reengagement with the world, though the physical act of painting lacks material stakes. The closure image—displaying the work on the quay—successfully reweights her isolation into connection.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s stance crystallizes around quiet intentionality, foreclosing doubt with felt cost (his earlier isolation). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—scent, vibration, and light accrue meaning without causal breaks. Orientation is clear by line 30; the single transition (lighthouse to grove) is legible. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the cork’s function remains mysterious but thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of signal, moonlight, and building intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands—the beacon works, the lost return, and Mara accepts cyclical labor—but cost is implied rather than dramatized (e.g., no sacrifice shown when the moon wanes). The cryptic calls function as setup/payoff, though their origin remains unexamined, risking convenience. Orientation is solid by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias chooses to return the eye, foreclosing possession of truth, with clear emotional cost (loss of autonomy, regained peace). The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore (find eye → speak truth → seek Mara → perform ritual). The orchard’s “exhale” and truffle discovery provide legible before/after. Cost is visible in the weight lifted from his chest and the eye’s transformation to gray.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, gaps, and fragmented memories layer until the journal crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias accepts stewardship of borrowed memories, foreclosing anonymity at the cost of permanent entanglement with another’s unresolved past. The final beam cutting through mist reweights the lighthouse from duty to legacy. Cost is legible: “the stranger’s borrowed memories had found a home within him”—a quiet but irreversible absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens: the chip → ants → passage → archway → new world → map forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “doorway of decisions” reweights maps from relics to instruments of agency, with cost implied in Elias’s burdened promise. However, the creek’s rise and recede functions more as backdrop than causal pressure; time doesn’t tighten decisions. The figure’s exposition slightly softens the climax’s earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the queen accepts responsibility, foreclosing her prior disengagement with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory and imagistic density (fireflies, bleeding starlight, lacy menace) until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens. Cost is legible in the vanished fireflies and softened grotto glow—symbols of lost innocence now charged with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: twilight deepens, the shell glows, perception thickens—culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the world is “revalued.” Closure lands via CR: the shared secret becomes a “living, breathing thing,” reweighting presence itself. However, cost remains abstract—the “gift” of density lacks concrete loss (time, tool, relationship strain). The inciting whisper triggers action, but escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options or raising stakes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “The story is not in the past or future—it is now” reframes Elara’s entire struggle with undeniable cost—the surrender of nostalgic fixation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through sensory density (birch bark, kerosene lamp, cloud-sea) and patterned recurrence of “soar,” culminating in a crystallized final image. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3. No causality breaks; the dream sequence functions as motivated ellipsis under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details, recurring objects, and thematic echoes deepen until the birthing screw reweights the entire narrative. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara’s realization that miracles reside in the ordinary—charged by the final image of fog lifting and the screw resting beside the repaired clock. Cost is legible in Elara’s enduring loss, now reframed as perceptual strength. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single transition (Mira’s return) tightens emotional pressure without disrupting flow.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and rhythmic cadence until the rain’s arrival forces a crystallization crisis. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara endures the storm by confronting fear, foreclosing reliance on superstition with visible cost—the scars reinterpreted, not erased. The floating platform, quill, and breath motif cohere spatially and temporally from the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test without penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: peace earned through relinquishing control, not mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory echoes (scent, sheet music, rustling leaves) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: miracles are redefined as cracks that let light in. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the orchard will fall, the grandmother is gone—but Elara’s reconciliation is resonant and earned. The hush before demolition functions as both temporal pressure and thematic frame, and the archive-to-orchard movement creates a coherent two-shard structure taught early. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR): the witness becomes “a participant, a unifier,” reweighting their role from observer to agent—but the cost is abstract (“etched into their soul”) with no on-page forfeiture or visible price. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies via dictionary glow, mural pulse, and temple tremor, yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; events happen *to* them. Orientation is strong early, but the causal chain relies on passive revelation, not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Clocks did not measure time; they measured the moments that defined existence,” reweighting the entire premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the density of silence, ticking, and ritual builds to a cadence shift at “one,” triggering discovery. The parchment’s message crystallizes stakes without retroactive patches. Orientation is immediate (“horizon measurement station… Elias”), and causality flows through embodied actions (counting, inserting key) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through bioluminescent imagery, permeable barriers, and whispered philosophy until the final image reweights everything as Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear by line 30; the ripple, footprints, and figure escalate pressure coherently. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible cost—abandoning intrusion detection for connection—but the transformation hinges more on lyrical resonance than causal chain. Cost is felt (“work had only just begun”) though not yet paid in action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (lantern, scrawls, rain) until the midnight cadence shift crystallizes Elara’s Charged Poise: she accepts contradictions as guides. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the reweighting of “lucid contradictions” from obstacle to compass—with conceptual cost (inherited unresolved grief). The library setting anchors orientation early; no disorientation penalty applies. Cost is legible in the final image: the mica pane’s fragility mirrors her vulnerable but steady commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated calls and a deepening melody until the glass disc becomes a bridge across temporal loops. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli renounces isolation by dialing a personal number, with felt cost in his exhaustion and the disc’s warmth signaling irreversible change. The loop structure pays off coherently, and the inciting incident (first hum) directly seeds the climax. Cost is legible in the final image: “I’m ready to begin” reconfigures his entire stance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery and thematic echoes rather than causal plot turns. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant’s meaning shifts from artifact to living practice, with cost implied in the fading light and Elara’s quiet commitment. However, the inciting incident (the stranger delivering the locket) is under-dramatized and borders on convenient exposition, weakening early causality. The ending crystallizes stakes effectively, but the middle lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options or raises tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs, and cadence shifts reweight loneliness as something created, not found. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image redefines reciprocity as active weaving, not passive receipt—with conceptual cost legible in Elara’s altered stance. The clock’s activation lacks causal groundwork, but as a lyric device within this lens, it functions. Orientation is clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: ultrasonic hum, musical notes, and emotional resonance build toward the stillpoint. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara internalizes the stillpoint, and her compass needle stills. Cost is conceptual (the end of searching) but legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 20, and the pattern is taught early, though escalation lacks tangible pressure or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a Causal lens: planting seeds → anomaly → Elara’s intervention → stabilization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she accepts uncertainty while restoring balance, with conceptual cost (history altered through understanding, not force). However, the climax lacks concrete stakes—her “writing” has no visible consequence beyond ambient stabilization, weakening causality at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (moonlight, silence, gestures) until the camera’s inexplicable click triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: silence is reweighted from emptiness to meaning. Cost is legible in Elara’s bittersweet smile and the acknowledgment that “none of it had mattered”—a conceptual price paid for her final act of creation. Orientation is immediate and stable; closure lands with Charged Poise as she departs, leaving behind a harbor now “alive with meaning.”

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: a trail of artistic artifacts builds density toward a Conceptual Repricing—the scroll reweights the civilization’s demise as an act of love, not loss. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who, where, when). Closure lands with conceptual cost (the promise’s recovery reframes history), though the “unmarked door” and “ethereal glow” verge on convenience. No causality breaks, but escalation relies on discovery rather than narrowing options or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and rhythmic patterning build to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara reinterprets entangled memories as connection, not corruption. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the burden of collective sorrow transformed into shared creation—and the auric lagoon’s hum directly catalyzes this shift. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-scene structure fits the word count perfectly. No causality breaks; every beat feeds the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story opens with strong orientation: port city, labyrinth, Eli’s role—all anchored by ~80 words. It follows a Causal lens: because Eli finds the coin/map/key, they pursue the center; because Mira appears, stakes crystallize; because Eli turns the key, the path opens. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth is revealed as a test where whispers hold power, with the cost being the surrender of solitude for connection. The map’s self-unfolding and storm’s timing serve motivated pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stranger’s posture shifts, hope flickers, and the guardian’s task concludes—all with felt emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterns build via shutters and reflections, culminating in a constellation-like image that reweights darkness/light. Orientation is clear by line 30. Minor deduction: the “half-spoken secret” stakes aren’t tested causally—resolution comes through atmosphere, not choice-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the structure lacks meaningful escalation—events unfold as a sequence of summaries rather than pressure-driven beats. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (“forest of second thoughts”), yet no visible or felt cost is legible on the page; success arrives frictionlessly. Orientation is clear early, but the “hush where past meets prophecy” remains a poetic phrase without narrative function. Closure lands thematically but without causal or emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s island encounter crystallizes her choice to embrace vulnerability, foreclosing her prior guardedness with felt cost (the scrimshaw’s loss). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the whale’s call, scrimshaw warmth, and island emergence build density until the final release reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“dock worker… sublittoral fringe”), and causality holds: each step follows from embodied perception, not coincidence. Cost is legible in the final image—freedom through acceptance, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces mandated happiness by preserving grief in silence, with visible cost (emotional void, isolation). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through recurring images (flowers, turbines, whittling) that reweight meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: the heart beside brittle flowers pulses “faintly,” embodying suppressed emotion. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the poet’s identity dissolves into landscape, reweighting “sacred” as permeable space, with conceptual cost—the ban’s lifting now demands continual boundary-crossing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via quartz hum, ice shards, cobalt light, culminating in cadence shift at poem’s end. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30 (“frozen lake,” “cobalt atrium,” “cloud-shadow poet”). Cost is legible in the final image: the lake is “no longer the same”—irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (glass shards, rustling leaves, humming reed) intensifies until the concertina’s melody crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias redefines beauty through imperfection—with cost legible in his renunciation of color replication. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“In the glassblower's courtyard…”), and the single-scene structure fits scope. The phoenix backstory is efficiently tethered to present stance via tactile cues (molten sand, ashes), satisfying BRR without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sounds layer into thematic density, culminating in Conceptual Repricing at closure—progress must integrate memory, not discard it. Orientation is solid by line 30 (lab, Elara, post-grid-stabilization). The pilgrimage lacks causal “because/therefore” links but deepens via cadence shift and emotional spectrum. Cost is legible: exhaustion and the burden of rediscovery charge the final image of renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs (vine, origami, coordinates) layer until the curtains’ illumination triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible—Elara’s hollow stasis gives way to renewed purpose, foreclosing passive mourning. The closure image (crafting the seed pendant) crystallizes stakes without over-explaining, though the “curtains of intention” mechanism borders on convenient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural + Causal), weaving symbolic cards with forensic data toward a Conceptual Repricing: the crash as engineered control. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the mural of ink and data reconfigures meaning with palpable hope amid ruin. Anchors are clear by line 30; causality holds. Yet the “blueprint” leap risks slight over-articulation without dramatized verification.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until the pattern of absence triggers closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is earned: Elara reconfigures her relationship to the past, with felt cost (“erosion of innocence”) legible in the final image. Orientation is solid by line 30; the archive’s shifting nature is taught early and pays off in the erased-tile revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s act crystallizes meaning without resolving all mystery, and cost is legible in her “triumph and sorrow.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (stone, shadow, blooms), culminating in the sculpture. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact though escalation relies on pattern deepening rather than narrowing options. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost: forgotten dreams demand witness.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (tail tip, stars, mist) and a cadence shift toward stillness. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s quiet realignment reconfigures meaning with felt cost—her shattered trust—but the “con” remains off-stage and vague, weakening causal grounding. The workshop setting holds the emotional weight, yet the betrayal’s mechanics are never dramatized, relying on reflection over action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring images (hourglass, tunnel, coffee rings) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the merging hourglasses enact Earned Stasis with visible cost—the fading scars. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the tunnel descent functions as a taught pattern. Closure lands with conceptual and emotional cost, though the “displaced miracle” remains under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increasing through layered letters that merge into a conceptual whole. Closure arrives via Charged Poise: Elara’s choice crystallizes stakes (“it didn’t have to stay that way”) with legible emotional cost. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when). A minor flaw: the projector’s magical function isn’t cued early enough as a rule, risking slight causality softness—but the lyric mode absorbs this.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory density (aurora’s song, astrolabe tremors, shifting archway symbols) culminating in Charged Poise—Lira’s readiness to follow the stars, crystallized at the archway with felt cost (years of solitude, fading village). Orientation is clear by line 30; closure lands with conceptual cost (creativity remains unreclaimed, but commitment is forged). One tightening occurs: the astrolabe’s needle trembling as stardust calls, narrowing her path to action. No causality breaks; the lens holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara shifts from passive carrier to active protector of divergence, with the ticking clock marking restored time. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through recurring objects until the archive reactivates. However, cost is implied rather than dramatized: the archive was dying, but we don’t see what Mara sacrifices to revive it. No path is foreclosed; her role expands without tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (gear, hum, translocation) until the machine’s activation delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the rainforest as mind. Cost is legible in Eamon’s persistent disorientation and the forfeiture of certainty for revelation. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3 (“mechanical rainforest… Eamon”), and closure lands with Charged Poise—the light envelops him, crystallizing his role as explorer/guardian. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the star stamp transfers from ticket to self, reweighting “unused courage” as internalized agency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the mist, twilight, and ridgeway accrue meaning through sensory repetition and cadence shifts. Cost is legible in the relinquished ticket and broken leash; the vigil ends with irreversible self-recognition. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence builds as texture until the bolt’s revelation reweights it conceptually. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the fortress guards fear, not tranquility—and Elias’s final act transforms silence into “frostbitten hope.” Cost is legible in the weight of the bolt and the burden of truth. The faint stain inciting discovery is subtle but sufficient for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rune of drift shifts from symbol of deception to one of renewal, reweighting the entire narrative. The causal chain—messages provoke responses, escalating to confrontation—is tight and motivated. Cost is legible in the pretender’s public unmasking and Elara’s enduring solitude. Constellations frame time without disrupting causality, and the library setting remains spatially coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images—the atlas page, tapping rhythms, vanished coastlines—until the final Conceptual Repricing crystallizes meaning. Closure is achieved via CR: the watermark revelation reweights the past as a cautionary archive, not just loss. Cost is legible in the conceptual burden of inherited choices. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-shard structure fits the length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (opera glasses, hum, stars), and cadence shifts build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the stone circle’s hum functions as both pattern and pivot. Cost is legible in Lira’s renunciation of passivity—she steps out “barefoot,” accepting vulnerability as agency. The only flaw: the rebellion’s lull is stated but never dramatized as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows because/therefore logic—Mara decodes the script *because* the plants guide her, the guard relents *because* of silent pressure, the unsealing succeeds *because* symbols align. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the embryo cracks open, redefining “tradition” as rebirth, not preservation. Cost is legible in Mara’s breathlessness, the vanished guard, and the regime’s looming threat. Orientation is clear by line 30; the drive remains coherent through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and recurring motifs until the photograph’s near-loss triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is Earned Stasis: Zara doesn’t heal but chooses to carry pain while creating art—a Charged Poise crystallized at the bench. Cost is legible in her shaky lines becoming purposeful; the lighthouse keeper’s legacy reframes endurance as active. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene adheres tightly to scope.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance shifts from despair to acceptance, with the cost being her surrender of perfectionism and the broken box left behind. The library’s spatial and emotional expansion mirrors her internal shift, and the lighthouse’s enduring light validates her new perspective. Every beat contributes to this accrual, and the ending crystallizes options without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: Elara’s search → drone leads her → confrontation → revelation → reconfiguration. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: time isn’t controllable but must be understood, with felt cost in her relinquished hope of rewriting the past. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who/where/when). The only flaw: the drone’s sudden evidentiary role at climax lacks prior demonstration of its recording capability, creating a minor causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore progression: letter arrives → curiosity overrides duty → access network → copy data → flee. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara stands at the threshold of irreversible consequence, cost legible in the library’s judgmental silence. However, the inciting letter’s origin remains unexplained, creating a minor causality gap, and the “blink that follows surprise” timeframe isn’t actively used to tighten decisions—it’s stated but not dramatized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Situational lens: coherent external pressure (father’s enemies) forces Elara’s stance crystallization. Closure is Earned Stasis—she refuses to abandon her farm despite threat, with visible cost (taking up a weapon against belief). The desert rose farm and airship scrap anchor setting and motif cohesively. However, the stranger’s arrival feels slightly convenient; causality leans on coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density in sound, silence, and celestial disorder culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s restoration via Kael’s Earned Stasis. The rail spike’s transformation into a tether provides on-page conceptual cost—the echo remains, but the goddess departs—and the constellations’ realignment signals a decisive reweighting of cosmic order. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality flows through pattern disruption and lyrical accumulation without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: Eleanor investigates because the journalist called, uncovers evidence, confronts the director, and intervenes. Closure takes the form of Charged Poise—her act of redirecting the telescope crystallizes her stance with symbolic cost. However, the journalist’s disappearance and the surveillance plot lack on-page verification; stakes remain abstract, weakening the felt consequence required for higher-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure building through layered sensory and emotional density rather than causal turns. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights silence not as erasure but as listening, crystallized in the “meteor hush.” Cost is legible—the irreversible loss remains, but its meaning shifts—and the amber, letters, and firmware all evolve cohesively toward this reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the grotto’s whispers, mist, and mandala patterns building density until the tile flake triggers a cadence shift into silence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: meaning is not found but created through engagement with silence. Cost is legible in Elara’s trembling hands and persistent “lilac unease,” now reframed as guidance. The pattern is taught early (“whispering grotto,” “emergent hush”) and pays off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and mosaic reassembly, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—mercy reframed from aberrant to essential. Orientation is clear by line 3 (plaza, post-fire, Elara alone). Closure lands via Charged Poise: the plaza becomes a “beacon of hope,” with cost implied in the labor and historical weight. However, the retrocognitive flashback halts momentum without altering present tactics, and the “shifting” mosaic edges into magical realism without prior cueing, slightly undermining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic resonance until the climax reweights the dominant stake: hope versus despair. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the garden’s healing and the woman’s departure crystallize a new possibility with felt cost (Mara’s bittersweet solitude). The fractured timeline is legible as pressure, not just motif, and the dawn capping the scene provides temporal and emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the light painting reweights telepathy as innate connection rather than pill-induced fracture, with undeniable conceptual cost (lost minds, severed pathways). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through light, geode, static—and the final image crystallizes options without tidy resolution. Cost is legible in “jagged edges where thoughts had been severed,” satisfying the gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional density builds through recurring patterns (heat-maps, fossil hums, floating) until the chamber revelation reweights everything as Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear by line 30; closure lands with Charged Poise—the glowing carvings crystallize meaning without resolving all mystery. Cost is conceptual (the burden of being “the voice of the unknown”) and legible in the final image. No causality breaks; escalation tightens via fossil-led deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern (buttons, echo, warehouse) until the chorus swells into revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the echo reweights “prophecy” as “possibility”—with conceptual cost (wisdom must be carried, not merely received). Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3. The final image of Elara walking away crystallizes Charged Poise: stakes and path are legible, burden felt.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara chooses to move forward without using the pill, reconfiguring her relationship to courage. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through recurring motifs (pillbox, snow codes, mist) culminating in the letter’s revelation. Cost is legible: she forgoes the safety of the pill and embraces uncertainty. Orientation is strong by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the palimpsest promise reframes reality not as something to be found but perceived. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through fog, needle, ticking gutters, and ambient whispers until the final reweighting crystallizes. Cost is legible in the cessation of the rain’s rhythm and the coachman’s irreversible shift in perception. Orientation is strong early, and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: light patterns, glass vibrations, and pottery forms layer meaning until the final Conceptual Repricing—kindness as temporal glue—is legible with emotional cost (the oasis’s loss and slow restoration). Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure lands via CR with felt cost, though the transition from solitary study to community action lacks a decisive on-page beat showing Elara’s choice to engage villagers.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic resonance toward a Charged Poise closure: the shared silence on the dock reconfigures isolation into connection. Cost is felt—not in action but in vulnerability (“protected vulnerability,” “piece of me”) and the relinquishing of solitude. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. The rhythm of oars and final petal serve as patterned motifs that pay off in the ending’s hush.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (sundial, hum, brittle light), and cadence shifts build toward a Conceptual Repricing—Elena realizing the Theraliths *are* the library itself. Closure lands decisively: she becomes the bridge, transforming isolation into interdependence. Cost is legible in the final image—her heartbeat synced to the orb’s pulse implies surrender of individual autonomy for symbiotic stewardship. Orientation is flawless by line 30; the tidal library, twin suns, and mossy stones anchor who, where, and when without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images (rain, lotus, nest, installation). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “thread that connected all things” shifts from metaphor to lived reality, with Elara’s lighter heart implying conceptual cost. However, the installation’s sudden activation via the spiral feels unearned—a late rule change not cued by prior mechanics. The groove “she hadn’t noticed before” introduces convenient discovery rather than causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story opens with strong orientation (who, where, when by line 3) and follows a causal drive lens: Elara observes → interprets → acts → succeeds → faces new social fallout. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she chooses vigilance despite deepening chaos, crystallizing her role as guardian. Cost is legible—the community fractures, sponsors flee, peace is “strange” and temporary—but the final image lacks a concrete, irreversible forfeiture that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density (stone scent → shifting symbols → organ reverberation) reweighting the dominant stake: confronting spatial mutiny as personal liberation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the chamber expands as Elara embraces fear, making a before/after legible with felt cost (her claustrophobia). The compass and organ motif pay off cohesively, though the father’s backstory remains abstractly anchored rather than altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, ribbon, quarry, and charcoal strokes layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where empathy is reimagined as artistic witness. Orientation is solid by line 30; causality isn’t required, but pattern intensifies meaningfully. Cost is legible—the vanished evidence, the void-like figure, the unsolved case—but the final “shift” lacks concrete consequence beyond internal poise. Closure lands with conceptual weight, though the cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara chooses to restore balance, and the world shifts with legible cost—the exile ends, legacy is reclaimed, but the station’s transformation implies irreversible change. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows from prior discovery (journal → map → ritual). The copper nail’s activation and whispered name form a decisive, earned climax with conceptual and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pixelated images coalesce into a map through sensory layering and landscape alignment. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“pixelated amnesty” transforms from abstract phrase to physical sanctuary—with luminous disbelief as conceptual cost. However, causality between beats is associative, not pressured; the hitchhiker’s method (“scaffold wrap flutters”) appears only at climax without prior testing or failure. No false moves or dead ends dilute narrative tension, making resolution feel discovered rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated motifs (train, money, calm) deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing—“some paths circle back… to teach us.” Closure lands with resonant clarity and emotional cost (accepting his father’s legacy). However, the journal discovery functions as convenient exposition rather than earned causality, softening pressure. Still, the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (stars, telegram, burdens) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: shared vulnerability as strength. Closure lands with felt cost—Elara’s solitude ends, replaced by cosmic witness—but the “decisive change” hinges on passive observation rather than active choice. The pattern is taught early and pays off coherently, though escalation lacks a true narrowing of options; insight arrives via alignment, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (glowing waters, scent of fruit and decay) and recurring motifs (seed, mirrors, unbending) build toward a Conceptual Repricing—truth lies beneath surfaces, revealed only through vulnerability. Closure lands decisively: Eira’s admission “I failed” triggers the seed’s transformation, healing the vortex. Cost is legible in her shattered reflection and surrendered defenses. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact despite lyrical delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterned imagery (clipping, scars, glade whispers) intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. However, causality is soft—Elara’s success hinges on passive receptivity rather than active choice that forecloses alternatives. Cost is implied (“scars,” “fractured world”) but never concretely dramatized as a trade-off in the climax. Orientation is strong early, but escalation relies on atmospheric thickening over decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara reaffirms her binding to the orchard, foreclosing personal freedom with tangible cost (“until there’s nothing left of me”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered images (roots, card, carvings)—and culminates in a Charged Poise where the final act (turning back to carve) reconfigures her debt as choice. Cost is legible in the closing image: the burned card now signifies agency, not obligation. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, recurring motifs (speaker cloth, echo valley), and rhythmic cadence shifts that reweight the central stake—purpose after loss. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps into sunlight with “faint stirrings of something new,” foreclosing retreat into fact-based insulation with felt cost (the void remains, but he chooses to fill it). The quarry setting and flickering lights anchor orientation early; no disorientation penalty applies. However, the inciting incident (auction failure) is summarized, not dramatized, slightly weakening causal pressure despite strong textual accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through symbolic resonance until the seed’s sprouting reweights everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the physics of transition was not just a theory to be studied but a truth to be lived.” Cost is legible in Eliara’s relinquished torment and the irreversible commitment to growth. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“floating sanctuary,” “cuneiform translator”), and causality flows via analogical insight rather than mechanical plot.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: identity fragments accumulate like seaweed, runes pulse and rearrange, and Elara’s ledger records shifting patterns. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—identity is redefined not as fixed but as process—and the cost is legible in the stabilized-but-changed townspeople and Elara’s quiet acceptance. The whisper (“By accepting contradictions…”) pays off thematically and structurally. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality is maintained through ritual logic rather than linear cause-effect, which fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts her role as bearer of collective hope, crystallizing options without physical action but with legible conceptual cost—the burden of carrying others’ abandoned dreams. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterned sensory details (radiance, hush, whispers) intensify toward the climax. However, the “heartbeat of hesitation” timeframe isn’t leveraged causally—it’s atmospheric, not tactical—missing a chance to raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (accordion, maps, graffiti) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s shift from chronicler to seeker. The closure—“the first steps of her path”—is Charged Poise: options reconfigured, cost felt (raw ache of memory), but not yet paid. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality isn’t required here, but pattern coherence is flawless. One tightening occurs when she chooses to trace her own map, foreclosing passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library reweights from sanctuary to living archive demanding voice, with the parchment’s pulse signaling irreversible change. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the hum, symbols, and watch coalesce into a cadence shift that deepens stakes without causal turns. Cost is legible in the watch’s silence and the library’s dimming, though the “fateful letters” timeframe lacks on-page pressure to fully charge the ending’s inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (perforated destiny, mulberry ache, plant whispers) until the violin’s song triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis. Cost is legible in the opaque, lifeless violin and Elara’s enduring ache. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality holds—every beat tightens toward the balcony climax. Closure lands with conceptual and emotional weight, satisfying all criteria for high-band publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara abandons her method to embrace stillness, with visible cost—the relinquishing of her life’s work. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterns in static give way to silence, deepening stakes without causal turns. Orientation is immediate and vivid; no disorientation penalty. The emerald’s arc pays off cleanly, and the aurora’s shifts mirror internal change without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and symbolic layering (hairpin, shell, lake) build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The map revelation and lake vision function as earned intensifications, not coincidences. Cost is legible in Elara’s emotional shift (“for the first time in years, she felt whole”), though the physical/emotional toll of her journey remains abstract. Orientation is solid from the opening line (“umbral grotto, perched above the clouds…”), and the two-shard structure (garden → lake) transitions cleanly via the shell’s touch.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (mirror shard, chimes, lighthouse). Closure takes the form of Conceptual Repricing: doubt is revalued as fertile ground, not paralysis. However, cost remains abstract—Mara’s transformation is off-page, and Elias pays no tangible price. The wind chime “code” functions as deus ex machina rather than earned insight, softening causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s act of speaking reconfigures her lifelong stance of withholding, with visible cost in the “heavy but unburdened” heart and the charged final image of brighter starlight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ripples deepen from vague patterns to sharp truth—and the magnetic grotto’s rules remain consistent. The flashback to her older self teaching silence functions as motivated reflection, not exposition, and directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: bird patterns, bone towers, and layered dust coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing where the arrowhead shifts from relic to compass of being. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Kael’s earned stasis carries conceptual cost (foregoing physical quest for inner navigation). Orientation is clear by line 30; time fluidity serves theme without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Eli’s manual spellcasting → journey to spire → trap activation → mist walking → keystone contact. Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the keystone redefines “impossibility” as perseverance, with conceptual cost (his methods remain outdated). However, the trap resolution leans on a deus ex machina—the harness works perfectly on first use despite prior failures, weakening causal integrity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through luminous imagery until the library scene crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias reinterprets sky lanterns as “luminous vows,” reweighting the premise with emotional cost (his unspoken desire now named and bound). Orientation is clear by line 2; causality isn’t required under this lens, and the pattern pays off cohesively. The hatch discovery leans on mild coincidence but doesn’t resolve conflict—it deepens mystery, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: static bursts, coins, and prophecy accumulate meaning toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the backwards prophecy becomes a roadmap, reweighting contraction as rebirth. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Lira; where: ambered observatory; when: post-contraction). However, the climax hinges on a machine emitting “deafening and silent” light without prior mechanics, creating a minor causality gap. Cost is conceptual (stellar doubt → quiet certainty) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara reclaims her role not by reversing loss but by redefining it through naming, crystallizing meaning from scattered light. The cost—enduring grief transformed into stewardship—is legible in her knelt posture, the weighted parchment, and the scythe no longer forgotten. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds via whispers, runes, and sea monsters until the final cadence shift (“she would carry these names”). No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell’s faint chime triggers the first wave, reweighting cosmic imbalance with tangible consequence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the dripping rates pattern intensifies to a cadence shift at climax. Cost is legible: the bell’s scar remains, and restoration is partial, not magical. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: photographs and the sapphire label accrue emotional density until the town square exhibit crystallizes collective memory. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the wind chime’s return signals communal reawakening, with conceptual cost in recovered identity. However, the trail’s discovery feels slightly coincidental rather than earned by Elias’s prior actions, weakening causal pressure. The pattern is taught early, transitions are legible, and the ending reweights the past without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the crystal reweights from object to symbol of harmony, with Elara’s identity shifting to “weaver of wonder.” Cost is felt through foreclosed solitude—she now carries balance into the world—but the flame’s origin and function lack causal grounding, leaning on coincidence. The starlings’ guidance works texturally but not causally; under an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation via sensory deepening holds. The orchard’s sigh at the end risks sentimentality over earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the seeker completes the mission but carries the burden forward, with cost implied in the “soundless echo” and dawn imagery. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition intensifies through sensory density and cadence shifts. However, the “pattern finally revealed” climax lacks concrete stakes or irreversible consequence; the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early (no penalty), and the arbor setting holds cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story opens with strong orientation (floating rock dojo, Kael meditating) and maintains a single scene with coherent spatial logic. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Kael shatters the jar, merging with the brain and lifting numbness—cost is felt as emotional vulnerability replacing detachment. However, the causal chain falters: the brain “responds with movements that mirrored Kael’s own” without established mechanics, relying on inexplicable connection rather than motivated action. History rewriting outside serves atmosphere but doesn’t pressure choices, weakening escalation under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seed reweights the entire premise from puzzle-solving to stewardship of enigmas, with the hidden chamber crystallizing Elias’s purpose. The causal chain is tight—seed → key → door—and each turn arises from protagonist agency under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the irreversible commitment to guardianship, charged by the “silence closing around him like a promise.” Orientation is immediate, stakes coherent, and escalation hinges on one meaningful deepening that transforms understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sound, echo, and wind until the tunnel exhales—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is strong by line 30; time (“after the final grain”) functions as a poetic trigger, not a causal clock. The closure lands with felt cost: laughter returns tentatively, not fully restored. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—pressure intensifies, but tactics don’t meaningfully shift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under a Situational drive lens: coherent pressure (the pendant’s offer vs. library’s survival) forces stance crystallization. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s decision to wait reconfigures options with legible cost (ongoing exile, deferred return). Orientation is strong from the first sentence; the frozen garden, mist, and Elara’s role are anchored by word 30. The single tightening—keeper’s revelation of the pendant’s price—narrows options cleanly and escalates stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density (ash, ember, crystallized petals) intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—vivification redefined as awakening dormant life, not resurrecting death. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance shifts, the crozier becomes seed, and cost is legible in the charred tree’s replacement by a fragile sapling. Orientation is clear by line 30. One flaw: the chant lacks causal scaffolding—it works because the narrative demands it, not because prior alchemical rules support it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as generative space, with felt cost in Elara’s relinquishment of control. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—static coalescing into melody, city stirring—and lunar perigee tightens the frame. Orientation is clear by line 30. Cost is legible in the shard’s dimming/faltering, demanding renunciation of finite-tool assumption.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: Mara survives but is “forever changed,” and the glowing hourglass signals irreversible transformation. The causal chain holds—interconnected patterns guide her into the rift, and resetting time resolves the ferry’s limbo. However, the mechanics of timeline merging remain vague, and the resolution leans slightly on conceptual assertion (“time began to rewind”) rather than dramatized causality. The lens is Hybrid (Causal/Textural), and it holds through closure with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara achieves Charged Poise—she endures, carries the tangled thread, and perceives reality as “sharper,” implying irreversible change. The cost (potential self-fracture) is legible in her trembling choice to continue weaving. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies via sensory density and memory eruptions, culminating in a decisive deepening. Orientation is functional disorientation taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of light, geometry, and navigation build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the stars and depths are reconfigured as parts of one map. Orientation is immediate (“benthic city,” “Elara Voss,” “harbor”), and the ending delivers Charged Poise: Elara stands ready to navigate, the chain vibrating, horizon “unfolded.” Cost is legible in the Council’s threat and cultural erosion, though the resolution leans optimistic without tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and emotional weight through sensory layering rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the photograph reweights silence into legacy, with conceptual cost (the woman’s forgotten story) made legible. The hearing aid’s fading pulses and warm photograph provide a charged poise that crystallizes Elara’s mission. However, the “dead call” premise isn’t fully dramatized—it functions more as mood than mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with tidal shifts, flickering light, and rising water creating rhythmic pressure that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: the cables are bridges to something ancient, not tools to control. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elena accepts limits on knowledge, and the crashing hush becomes a promise. Cost is legible in her relinquished need for answers and enduring fear. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and symbolic density intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines existence beyond bureaucratic erasure. Orientation is immediate (observatory, snow, death certificate), and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the ghost becomes part of her future—is charged with conceptual cost (erased timeline, lost self). The inkblot’s transformation into data and the shard’s glow cohere causally within the established logic. One hairline slip: the radio voice emerges without prior auditory setup beyond “static,” slightly weakening linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: echoes intensify, patterns coalesce, and sensory density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands decisively—the language is etched into the canyon, the diamond shatters, Lira survives weakened but fulfilled—with tangible cost (her vitality). Orientation is immediate (“towers of bone,” “canyon of endless echoes,” “Lira”), and the single POV remains anchored throughout. The only flaw: the flock of birds’ sudden narrative utility feels slightly coincidental rather than fully foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory density and recurring motifs (arrowhead, phone, “harmony untamed”) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s shift from bitterness to “frostbitten hope.” Orientation is clear by line 3; causality isn’t linear but pattern-coherent. Closure lands via Charged Poise—her stance reconfigured, cost felt in the silent, heavier phone. However, the cryptid’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient buildup, making the climax feel slightly conjured rather than accumulated.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara’s music reclaims the orchard, dissolving statues and restoring color, with the locust shell’s glow marking irreversible change. The causal lens holds—each escalation (melody falters → heartbeat sync → roots awaken) follows because/therefore logic. Cost is legible: the shell becomes inert, and the mechanical order is permanently broken. Orientation anchors (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) are clear by line 30, and the drive intensifies coherently to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Causal (drone flight, chase) fused with Accumulative/Textural (recurring motifs of fracture and mending). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elias watches unity bloom but retreats, carrying unhealed grief. Cost is legible—the temporary truce doesn’t recover his sister—and the storm bottle’s release reweights the sky metaphor with tangible consequence. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality holds without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as fertile ground. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: silent carpenter; where: abandoned circus train; when: misty morning). The closure—a restored carousel and pendant-worn hope—lands with resonant reconfiguration and conceptual cost (the burden of renewed purpose). The “wrong turn” functions as a patterned motif rather than causal link, which fits the lens, though the wind bells’ guidance borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (scarf, geometry, books) until the library’s transformation crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara accepts her role as guardian, with the scarf’s restoration signaling conceptual repricing of memory’s value. Cost is legible—the fading realm requires active protection—but the patrons’ disappearance lacks explicit consequence, slightly softening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory and imagistic density rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes in a luminous moment where past and future converge, and cost is legible in her relinquishment of chasing the old dream. The pulsing light and whispering islands function as pattern-taught motifs that pay off at closure. Minor deduction: the inciting anomaly (pulsing light) arrives without prior groundwork, slightly weakening escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and symbolic recurrence (hair, star, key) build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the world feels different after the idea’s release. Orientation is anchored early (“shadowed nexus,” “first star of twilight”), and the vault’s living nature justifies its shifting locks. Yet the ending’s transformation remains abstract; no concrete consequence or reconfiguration of options is shown, only asserted (“everything around her felt different”).

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: motifs (constellations, fairy rings, shipwrecks) accrue meaning until the locket discovery triggers a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara stands beneath aligned stars, poised to reclaim memory—with felt cost (decades of void). The missing mushroom imprint functions as a taught pattern that pays off cleanly, though causality leans slightly on coincidence (locket placement).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard-mirror transforms from prison to portal, and Elara’s quiet resolve crystallizes a Charged Poise where cost (years of isolation, emotional labor) is felt without being stated. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through sensory layering and symbolic recurrence, culminating in a twilight shift that reweights silence from emptiness to expectancy. The library’s aliveness at the end is earned by her annotation act, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (seed, hush, weaving) until the sprouting seed delivers a Conceptual Repricing: wonder is not lost but transferable. Orientation is solid by line 30 (Elara, parapet, waterfall, heirloom seed). However, closure lacks a legible cost—nothing is sacrificed, only restored—and the ritual’s success arrives without resistance or complication, softening stakes. Time distortion (“hours or minutes”) dilutes urgency rather than deepening thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence deepens, knots tighten, whispers accumulate, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara understands her purpose. Cost is legible—the sanctuary feels “lighter,” her heart “heavy but at ease”—and the prism light reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30. However, the escalation lacks a true narrowing of options; resistance from the net is atmospheric, not tactical, weakening causal pressure under even an accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands alone as guardian of silence, the chapel’s rediscovery reweighting history and her role within it. The causal chain—video discrepancy → excavation → wooden beams—is clear and motivated. Cost is felt in reverence and solitude, though physical stakes remain low. Orientation is strong by line 30; lens is Causal with Accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (snow globe, unfinished narratives) until the final Conceptual Repricing: “letting the snow fall where it may” reweights the entire premise. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise—the library’s silence shifts from tomb to lullaby—as Elara internalizes release. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of the globe, a tangible symbol of her pursuit. Orientation is immediate (“sunken ship library,” “Elara,” “snow globe”), and the single shard structure serves the lyric escalation flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes—she accepts her role as conduit for the unseen—with conceptual cost (ongoing solitude, endless work). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds via shifting graffiti, pulsing bolt plate, and storm cadence until the ghost coheres. The “between lightning and thunder” timeframe tightens pressure credibly. Cost is legible in the silent bolt plate and her solitary resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: each floor adds symbolic weight, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (“Joy is not the absence of anguish...”). Closure lands with emotional cost (grief transformed into purpose), though the elevator’s mechanical progression risks feeling like a checklist. The pattern is taught early and pays off cohesively, but the lack of a true reversal or narrowing of options limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through cloud imagery until the glowing cumulus triggers a Conceptual Repricing: the sky as memorial. Closure lands decisively—the gondola is repaired, Elara returns transformed, and the theory is proven—with conceptual cost (her isolation, the burden of guardianship) legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate (“sky gondola hung motionless”), and the pattern of emotional cloud-categorization pays off in the climax. No causality breaks; the “broken string” functions as inciting pressure, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “stillness” shifts from oppressive to beautiful, reweighting the premise with emotional cost—she risks collapse to complete her work. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with density increasing through sensory and symbolic layering (coin, constellations, hollow tree). Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains intact despite lyric pacing. The building’s collapse provides tangible stakes without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterns intensify (starlings → board → luminance), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the map redefines discovery as perseverance. Closure lands with Charged Poise—the hatch opens, the map is found, and Elara’s mission crystallizes. Cost is implied (Thorne’s absence, her solitude) but not viscerally dramatized on the page; a sharper consequence (e.g., airship damage, lost time) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (gears, mirrors, ticking) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: repair is not mechanical but relational across time. Orientation is immediate (“frozen library above clouds”), and the closure—a Charged Poise where Elara returns with clarity and purpose—carries conceptual cost (the weight of infinite selves). The unseen clock’s ticking evolves from ambient sound to narrative heartbeat, tightening stakes without causal breaks. One flaw: the door’s sudden appearance lacks foreshadowing, though it serves thematic inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs build toward a resonant reconfiguration (RR) via the bell’s ringing and nebula’s return. However, causality falters—Elara’s chalked message triggers action without resistance, and the clapper’s recovery relies on convenient memory, not struggle. Cost is implied (dwindled butterflies, dull wings) but never felt in protagonist choices; the climax resolves via orchestration, not earned consequence. Closure lands visually but lacks tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts fragility and continues her work despite inevitable future breaks, with visible cost in blood and doubt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the nested patterns intensify through sensory and emotional density, not causality. Orientation is clear by line 3. A decisive deepening occurs when the hush “breaks” into whispers, reweighting the stake from repair to resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara redefines her role not by breaking the curse but by asserting agency within it. The nut-driven map enables a decisive navigation that weakens the curse—a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (ongoing vigilance, mechanical birds’ warning cries). Causal lens holds: because the nut leaves impressions, therefore she assembles a map, therefore she rescues the traveler, therefore the orchard responds. Cost is legible in the trembling ground and persistent patrol.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: river foam, chrysalis, and polymer metaphors layer into a Conceptual Repricing at closure—separation as bridge, not barrier. Cost is legible in Elena’s shift from isolation to integration, though the “atonement” stake lacks concrete on-page testing. Orientation is clear by line 3; the single-scene structure fits scope, and the final image reweights prior motifs without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the blank book becomes a vessel for integrated fragmentation, reweighting the library’s very function. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and patterned imagery (moonlight, glass, paroles)—culminating in a resonant final image where stories float “eternal and ever-changing.” Cost is legible in the empty vial: purpose fulfilled but glow dimmed. Orientation anchors are swift and vivid, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara dissolves the pavilion by subsuming its remorse, emerging lighter but aware it will return—foreclosing permanent escape at the cost of enduring cyclical sorrow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with tidal pool analysis → corridor navigation → central shard forming a coherent pressure arc. Cost is legible in the melting pavilion and dawn-lit departure. Orientation is immediate (“desert fortress after rain”) and never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community’s reconnection is legible, and the astronomical clock’s revival symbolizes renewed unity. However, causality is weak—the clock responds magically to song without established rules, and the townsfolk’s shift from fragmentation to harmony occurs off-stage via summary rather than dramatized choice. The inciting action (singing) lacks opposition or risk, flattening escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: memory shards, lunar imagery, and thematic echoes build density toward a Conceptual Repricing—human dreams are not lost but retrievable through reassembly. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stance crystallizes (“keeper of memories”), and the stars “seem closer,” implying renewed agency with conceptual cost (abandoning pure engineering for custodianship). However, the “modification” lacks causal mechanics—it happens off-stage—and the before/after shift hinges on assertion rather than dramatized consequence. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because Elara deciphers the doodle, she enters during inversion, which enables access to the chamber. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the seed reweights knowledge as vigilance—but the cost (“responsibility”) isn’t dramatized with tangible consequence. Orientation is solid by line 30; gravity inversion is well-signaled. However, the manuscript slipping and being caught adds no pressure—it’s a decorative near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (cracks as music, silence as vessel) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpture’s transformation reweights silence into song. The porcelain insulator’s late prominence risks convenience, but its early introduction and charged reprise in the climax justify its role. Cost is legible in Elara’s trembling and the hedgehog’s cyclical witness—endurance with visible exhaustion. Orientation is immediate and precise; causality flows through sensory logic, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the eclipsed covenant is reframed from burden to growth opportunity, with Alara’s toppled king symbolizing earned stasis. The magnetic nexus functions as a causal amplifier, turning internal reflection into externalized pattern. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who/where/when), and the single-scene structure fits scope. Cost is conceptual—exile redefined as purpose—but lacks tangible, on-page sacrifice beyond symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through sensory detail and thematic layering rather than causal turns. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: empathy is redefined as honoring silence, with emotional cost implied but not dramatized (e.g., no sacrifice, regret, or altered future action). The diary opens via mystical intuition, not earned causality, weakening pressure escalation. Still, the ending image reweights the premise with quiet conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory details, journaling, and floral motifs layer toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The “turning of the tide’s thought” provides a functional temporal frame, and the corpse flower’s sprout triggers the final insight. However, the escalation lacks a tightening that narrows options—Elara never faces a concrete dilemma where she must choose between ambition and presence. Cost is implied (emotional emptiness) but not made visible through action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure: the echoes’ restoration reweights the premise of planetary memory as resilience. Causality is mostly sound under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the holographic map appears without prior signaling of such capability. Cost is legible—fading echoes threaten collapse—but the resolution leans slightly on convenience (arrow tip fits stone groove perfectly).

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s silence reweights “foresight” from aspiration to indictment. The drive lens is Causal—wind patterns → funnel effect → crash—but causality hinges on exposition, not dramatized discovery. The patch’s discovery lacks investigative friction; it functions as a prop, not a pivot. Cost is felt (“fragility of human systems”), though not viscerally paid by Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: stillness is redefined as “presence of possibility,” with aurora-fueled resonance charging the final image. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory density and cadence shifts—and holds coherently to the end. Cost is legible in Elara’s lifelong burden and the precise timing constraint, though the sculptor’s chisel remains off-stage. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because she failed before, she seeks the flute; therefore, she plays it to learn. Orientation is solid by line 30. Closure is Charged Poise—Elara steps into the unknown with lessons in hand—but the cost remains abstract (no tangible loss or foreclosed path on the page). The canyon-to-realm transition is earned, though the “lessons of her past” resolve feels slightly declarative rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias emerges with altered understanding, the halo dimmed, dawn arrived—options reconfigured with conceptual cost (loss of borrowed masks as armor). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density intensifies through sensory layering and rhythmic prose until the climax. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who, where, when). Cost is legible in the final image: the workshop “transformed,” Elias carrying only a “faint glow”—a quiet but earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s understanding shifts from courier to chosen carrier, reconfiguring her relationship to wonder, relics, and the fade. The aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant vibration cohere under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence and sensory density intensifying toward the end. Cost is legible—the loss of Alaric’s steadiness is replaced by uncertain purpose, felt in “she knew she’d return.” Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact despite lyrical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s realization that objects hold “truthful lies” reweights her entire premise with conceptual cost—knowledge now burdens her with responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with mist, quartz hum, and frost patterns building toward the charged poise of the final image. Cost is legible in the “heavier” air and her changed stance. Orientation is clear by line 30, and escalation tightens via resonance discovery, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps onto the bridge, reconfiguring silence from unraveling to weaving, with clear cost (“the weight of her sacrifice—the life she had left behind”). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering, patterned motifs (bead, puzzle, loom), and cadence shifts. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten orchard… bamboo forest”), and the final image makes conceptual cost undeniable. One tightening (leaving home) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clear causal drive: Eli accepts the bargain → descends the mines → weaves the silk → triggers renewal. Orientation is immediate (“heart of the orchard planet,” “meek blacksmith named Eli”), and closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost: Eli’s altered selfhood. However, the mine descent compresses days into summary, weakening beat-by-beat escalation; the climax is dramatized well, but the journey lacks tactical friction that would heighten cost. The lens (Causal) holds firmly through to the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory impressions build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure (she is a guardian). However, the transition to the alien forest relies on passive reception (“pulled, not physically”), weakening causal agency. The orb’s appearance resolves stakes too neatly, and the repair bay’s transformation lacks on-page consequence or cost—closure lands conceptually but without felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring objects and cryptic signals. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines the lighthouse’s purpose and his role within it, with cost felt in the relinquishment of ambiguity for duty. The hidden compartment and letters function as patterned payoffs, though the causal link between stone-stacking and mechanism feels slightly convenient. Orientation is strong early; all key elements converge coherently by dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam redefines reality, revealing a green dawn and interdimensional beings, with clear conceptual cost—the Herald’s role shifts from solitary keeper to cosmic guide. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through rhythmic description, patterned light imagery, and cadence shifts that culminate in the fog’s response. Orientation is immediate (“quiet hours,” “emerald lighthouse”), and the beam’s loss of control at midpoint tightens stakes without breaking causality. The final image reweights all prior routine as sacred preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sun trails, iridescence, and whispered stories layer toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate and stable. The blue morpho wing’s reappearance reconfigures meaning, and the final image crystallizes Kael’s purpose with conceptual cost—he must keep bearing others’ storms. No causality breaks, though escalation relies more on atmosphere than pressure; still, the cadence shift at sunset tightens focus effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth and sextant heal not through plot mechanics but through accumulated dream fragments reweighting sorrow into resilience. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of dream-images intensifies until moonlight realigns both object and space. Cost is legible in the “weight” Elias feels and the silence that shifts from oppressive to resonant. The pin-drop bookends create a precise temporal frame that tightens meaning without causal contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (mica, songs, dawns) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse shifts from tomb to cradle via Elara’s song. Orientation is immediate—“alchemical orchard greenhouse, shrouded in endless night”—and the mirror-world transition is cleanly taught. Closure lands with conceptual cost: unity is restored, but the price of collective forgetting remains implicit in the rekindled light. No causality breaks; every beat deepens the texture toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the blank book reweights “wisdom” as active seeking. Cost is legible (“no longer alone,” implying prior isolation) and the midnight timeframe tightens beats. However, the conclave’s dissolution decades prior weakens causal urgency; the invitation’s arrival feels fated rather than earned through Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (bread, soil, plaque) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the sacred is in the ordinary. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the closure lands with legible conceptual cost—the acceptance that meaning persists amid decay. The stone plaque discovery functions as a resonant reconfiguration, not a deus ex machina, because it echoes Elara’s prior actions. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; pressure deepens atmospherically but not causally.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s role reconfigures from preserver to conduit, with the library’s softening hush and brighter slides signaling conceptual repricing. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via luminous vows weaving into a tapestry, culminating in the transformed slide that reweights all prior fragments. Cost is legible: she trades archival detachment for charged responsibility. Orientation anchors instantly (“frozen library above the clouds”), and causality holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story lands a valid Charged Poise closure: Lila reconfigures power through words, not violence, and the truce holds—but fragilely. The “sound of trust breaking” crystallizes as a quiet, irreversible fracture, with conceptual cost legible in the dawn-lit stillness. Orientation is solid by line 30; the causal lens holds via Lila’s agency driving each turn. However, the thieves’ capitulation lacks on-page resistance, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and symbolic density toward a Charged Poise closure: Elara accepts her role without overt action, but the cost—abandoning pure skepticism—is legible in her steady voice amid inner turmoil. Orientation is clear by line 30; the aurora, bluff, and election frame anchor time/place. However, the “forests hold elections” premise remains abstract, and the figure’s exposition-heavy dialogue flattens causal pressure. The ring’s guidance drives progression, but the convergence lacks a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and symbolic recurrence until the cave’s silence becomes unbearable. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s final stance crystallizes with visible cost—years of suppression acknowledged, the lock shattered as metaphor. The glimmer behind crystals functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence, and the note’s reappearance reweights prior stasis. Cost is legible in the “auroral sorrow” of the finished painting—a visual reckoning with lost time.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: truth revitalizes the city, symbolized by returning water. The causal lens holds—each discovery (map, plate, chamber) leads to deeper knowledge and decisive action. Cost is legible in the betrayal Elara absorbs and the societal lie she must confront. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single-POV two-shard structure (studio → undercity → return) fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: truth intensifies through sculpting, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elara accepts transience. Cost is conceptual—the fading of wonder—but legible in the dimming light and wrapping of the fragment. Orientation is solid by line 30; however, escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure accumulates atmospherically but doesn’t narrow options or force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density builds toward the box’s opening, and the final image reweights the desert roses as emblems of endurance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara forecloses emotional access to preserve the farm, with visible cost (“memories... now felt distant”). The magnetic north shift functions as atmospheric pressure, not causal engine, but the pattern holds coherently. One tightening occurs (box opened → fears materialize → miniaturization enacted), sufficient for length, though causality occasionally softens into mood.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details, whispers, and objects accrue meaning toward a Conceptual Repricing—listening as restorative act. Closure lands with cost (emotional resonance of unclaimed forgiveness), though the locket’s key feels slightly convenient. Orientation is clear by line 30; the mailbox mystery tightens stakes once. However, the causal link between Clara’s identity and the resolution lacks friction—she’s chosen because she “listens,” but we don’t see her earn that role through failure or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density, recurring motifs (dice, journal, spider), and cadence build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—knowledge resurrected through embodied code. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens. However, the climax lacks a felt cost: the laboratory “awakens” without consequence, and Elara’s triumph carries no tangible price, weakening closure’s emotional or conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: memories aren’t lost, only misplaced. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—Eli’s understanding reweights reality—and the salt chamber’s resonance validates the shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; the whale backstory is anchored to present action via the wildflowers. One meaningful deepening (the gravity fluctuation) tightens stakes without false causality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence deepens, the wing glows brighter, prophecy resists, then is sealed. Closure is Earned Stasis—Elara endures, foreclosing chaos at the cost of eternal vigilance (“balance was fragile”). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality flows via resonance, not logic. However, the climax lacks a decisive physical or psychological rupture—the “final surge” feels rhetorical, not dramatized, softening the cost’s tangibility.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s knock reconfigures her stance toward community and memory, with visible cost (years of isolation acknowledged). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory detail, linguistic metaphors, and meteor shower cadence. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in “the journey had begun,” crystallizing stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the garden shifts from beauty to metaphor for memory transformation, with felt cost in Elara’s absorbed radiance and silent shell. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory and emotional layering, culminating in tapestry imagery. The last-star-to-morning-light frame tightens causally, and the seashell’s resonance structures evolve meaningfully. No orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s act of erasure reconfigures her relationship to pain, crystallizing a stance that forecloses revenge with felt emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the drip rhythm, aurora light, and thorn’s action build density until the final blank scroll signifies liberation. Cost is legible in the “chain breaking within her soul” and the sanctuary’s held breath. Orientation is clear by line 2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery and echoing motifs rather than causal chains. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elara reinterprets echoes as intentional cosmic threads, shifting from personal longing to universal understanding. Cost is felt emotionally—the dissolution of her melancholy—but remains abstract; no tangible path is foreclosed. The pool vision delivers insight without dramatized resistance, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through dream fragments that coalesce into narrative clarity. Orientation is immediate (“Arctic,” “wreck-diver ghost whisperer,” “candle-lit shrine”), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the snow globe clears just enough to reveal the village, reweighting loss as preserved memory. Cost is legible in Elara’s whispered names—a charged poise where connection is achieved but physical restitution is foregone. The pattern of dream shards is taught early and pays off cohesively at dawn’s light.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (fireflies, moon paths, the whisk) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: Elara realizes hidden patterns exist within herself as well as the world. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—though the “cost” remains conceptual rather than visceral. No causality breaks, but the tightening lacks a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara endures vigilance, foreclosing ignorance at a felt cost—the return of dust storms and the burden of secrecy. The Causal lens holds: each discovery (letters, diamond’s function) triggers the next action. However, the climax’s chant-and-scream resolution leans slightly on unestablished ritual mechanics, risking a minor causality soft spot. Cost is legible in the final image: truth preserved, peace lost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because Elias hears the voice, he activates the portico, which reconfigures reality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the dawn symbolizes a new beginning shaped by his choice, with cost legible in lost sanity, relationships, and past stability. However, the climax (“fracturing into a thousand shards of light”) leans on summary over dramatization, slightly dulling the decisive act’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sounds and repeated motifs until the music box’s autonomous eruption reweights everything. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s identity crystallizes into “keeper of memories,” with tangible cost—the shattered jar—and emotional legibility in his wistful smile. The wind’s pause and the loft’s transformed emptiness charge the final image with earned weight. Orientation is clear by line 20, and causality remains intact through sensory accumulation rather than plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: vibration → threat → confrontation → revelation → defense. Closure takes the form of Charged Poise—Elara endures as guardian, foreclosing surrender of the key—but the cost remains abstract (no physical, emotional, or tactical loss shown). Orientation is solid by line 30, though the climax leans on summary (“channeled the key’s energy”) rather than granular action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building rhythm through recurring images (moon, viaduct, ice), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: patience reweights the world’s rule-set. However, the cost is abstract—no visible or felt sacrifice is made; Elara simply “feels completion.” The magnetic viaduct’s pull and moon-tracking never generate concrete stakes that narrow options or force trade-offs. The ending resonates lyrically but lacks the decisive pressure required for high-band publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: each discovery (scratches, journal, symbols, photo) logically drives the next action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara emerges with crystallized agency and visible cost (ruptured mentorship). However, the inciting fissure-to-compartment sequence lacks tactile causality; the hidden chamber feels discovered rather than deduced. Cost is legible but not deeply felt in the body or relationships beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias departs “ready to face” the storm, with the ticking heart reconfiguring his options and moral stance. The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (Thomas’s request → Elias’s doubt → Alistair’s insight → resolve). Cost is legible in the “weight of his task” and years of Thomas’s imprisonment. Orientation is crisp by line 30; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (bell, acid sea, gears) until the kaleidoscope reveals the bell shape—a pattern break that triggers closure. The holographic bell’s appearance and vanishing constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world responds, Lira’s quest is validated, and the echo remains as conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp by line 30, and causality within the accumulative frame holds without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a causal drive lens: each discovery leads logically to the next, culminating in Elara’s Charged Poise—stepping out with coordinates memorized, ready to act. Orientation is solid by line 20 (who, where, when). Closure is resonant: the “sensed absence” becomes a mirror for the crew’s void, and cost is legible in her risk of exposure. Minor deduction for the system lockout feeling slightly convenient, though it serves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: each mirror adds density and deepens the thematic pattern, culminating in reconstitution. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who: Elara; where: lighthouse orchard/vintage store; when: present tense). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the restored crystal ball reweights the premise of empathy-as-action—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The escalation is coherent but lacks a tightening that narrows options or forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with lyrical density building toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “endings” as life-affirming rather than morbid. The closure lands with emotional cost—the lifted weight, tightened grip on reality—and the parasol’s evolution charges the final image. However, the inciting shift (“waking up changed”) isn’t causally tested; it’s asserted, then passively resolved by ambient epiphany rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density through vineyard imagery and the recurring letter fragment. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights “destiny” as “learning to dance with the mismatches,” with felt cost in her solitude and relinquished idealism. The amber pavilion and final bus provide temporal and spatial anchors early; no orientation penalty applies. However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—pressure remains static, relying on reflection rather than rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s act crystallizes the parapet’s renewal and the prophet’s arrival, making before/after legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—whispers thicken, stones glow, clearings awaken—but cost remains conceptual (“imprints erased”) without visceral or irreversible loss. Setup and payoff cohere, though escalation lacks narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images and sensory detail. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara departs with quiet hope, the ruins transformed by vines and memory. Cost is felt—her grief is acknowledged, not erased—and the lavender field’s “whisper” crystallizes meaning. Orientation is solid by line 30, and the pattern of photograph-as-puzzle-piece pays off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory echoes until the pattern coalesces—a valid RR (Charged Poise). Closure lands with conceptual cost: the crystal’s energy drains as knowledge is gained, making loss the price of restoration. The “suspended hush” lifts only after decoding, tying atmosphere to resolution. One tightening suffices: the shift from fragmented noise to legible blueprint narrows his path to irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds coherently: fog, chalk, and driftwood accrue symbolic density until the pond-circle closure crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“fog sculpture garden,” “Elias”), and the final hum delivers Conceptual Repricing—the sound of aging redefined as interstitial vibration. Cost is legible in Elias’s relinquished chalk and abandoned search, making before/after states undeniable. A hairline slip: the driftwood’s reappearance feels slightly convenient but doesn’t undermine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara doesn’t stop time but moves with it, redefining constancy. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (leaf, spinning hand) until the cadence shift at dawn reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the “warm glow” replacing the “luminous ache,” implying surrender of control. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara facilitates reconciliation, foreclosing isolation with visible emotional cost (Claire’s tears, years of estrangement). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory and melodic layering, not causality—and the final image reweights the vinyl fragment with resonant meaning. Blood work establishes urgency, but time pressure isn’t actively dramatized in tactics, slightly weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: because Elara relearns runes, she can activate the key, which resolves the shadow mystery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—shadows go to a void during awakenings—and carries mild conceptual cost (the mentor’s absence, the burden of knowledge). However, the “loops” mechanic is asserted, not dramatized causally; transitions between shards (workshop → precipice) lack pressure linkage, weakening escalation. The ending lands with clarity but minimal felt consequence beyond revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps into the unknown with the tooth-star as promise, reconfiguring certainty into possibility. The causal lens holds—each action follows from prior choice (tooth placement → stone offering → transformation)—and cost is legible in the surrendered stone symbolizing control. However, the changeling’s stakes remain vague, weakening the “mend what was broken” payoff; the fountain’s rules feel slightly expository rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory detail and memory until the sea glass awakens as a symbol of transformed pain. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Lira steps into the world with her light, foreclosing isolation at the cost of vulnerability. The grotto’s mist, moonlight, and polished glass coalesce into a final image that reweights her vow without mechanical resolution. Cost is legible in her relinquished solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (icicle patterns, moss, amber light) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: vulnerability, when protected, can bloom. The closure is earned—Elara’s realization is legible in the final image of shared silence—and cost is felt through her prior isolation. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene structure fits the word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers intensify into stories, the shell glows, mist parts—all deepening thematic density. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: writing becomes an act of solemnization that reweights forgotten hopes into permanence. Cost is implied (emotional burden) but never made concrete on the page—a missed opportunity to ground the CR in a visible sacrifice, such as abandoning her original novel concept.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density, lyrical cadence, and recurring golden imagery intensify toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The vine’s transformation into remedy-orbs constitutes a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the sacred knowledge is restored but now requires active dissemination. Orientation is immediate (“verdant arbor at dawn”), and causality is maintained through embodied ritual rather than plot mechanics. A hairline slip: the moon’s lingering presence at dawn slightly strains realism but serves thematic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building density through ritualized actions that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the safekept starlight is spent, the orchard transformed—but the “tremor” that signals the world exhaling feels decorative rather than causally earned. The pattern-to-map transformation is visually resonant but lacks a decisive narrowing of options or irreversible consequence beyond mood shift.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (light, reflection, echoes) until the timer’s activation crystallizes meaning. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias holds repaired wonder, foreclosing despair with felt cost (years of labor, sleepless nights). Orientation is solid by line 30 (“marble cavern… Elias crouched…”). However, the “wounded season” timeframe exerts little causal pressure—it’s atmospheric, not tactical—slightly weakening escalation under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara doesn’t abandon her role but reconfigures it to include herself, with cost legible in the "crack" within her soul and the relinquishing of pure self-erasure. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the grotto’s sensory density intensifies until the figure’s arrival breaks pattern, reweighting Elara’s purpose. Orientation anchors firmly by line 30 (who: Elara; where: bronze grotto; when: after first snowmelt). Cost is crystallized in the kerosene lamp’s steadier flame—a visual proxy for recalibrated burden.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts grief’s impermanence through creation, crystallizing peace with visible cost—loneliness transformed into art. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; rain, tools, and wood grain deepen pressure without causal turns. Orientation is immediate and precise. Cost is legible in the final image: the lion embodies both loss and resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with closure achieved through Charged Poise: Mara’s reconfiguration of regret as guidance crystallizes options without resolving them. Cost is legible in the “weight of her regret” and the irreversible act of collecting fragments. Orientation is anchored early (“kinetic lagoon above the clouds”), and the pattern of fragment-gathering tightens meaningfully toward the ending image. The voice-loop revelation functions as a motivated intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of air, light, and memory build toward a Conceptual Repricing—hope as resurrection through attention. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Eli leaves with the sextant, the terminal “alive” in illusion, foreclosing its practical reuse but affirming symbolic renewal. Cost is conceptual (abandoning utility for meaning) and legible in the dawn-lit transformation. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara chooses to integrate her dream into her duty, foreclosing escape but gaining peace, with cost legible in the “emptiness” now filled. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the story builds density through recurring sensory motifs (rain, crystals, silence) until the cadence shift at completion lightens the sanctuary. Orientation is clear by line 30; the frozen clock’s blank face anchors both past and present stakes. The whispering crystals’ evolution from nostalgia to directive (“bear”) to affirmation (“home”) tightens pressure coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story establishes setting and character quickly, anchors time and place by line 30, and follows a single POV in one continuous scene—meeting scope defaults. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elara stands at dawn with journal and sundial, reconfiguring decay into possibility. But the cost is implied, not dramatized—an on-page forfeiture (e.g., abandoning another quest, sacrificing safety) would make it undeniable. The causal chain is clean, though the inciting action (finding the chest) leans on instinct over obstacle, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (knots, fulgurite, fog) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the rope is revealed as a map of woven time. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—the world “approves” as Elara completes her task—and cost is legible in the quiet sacrifice of solitude and obscurity. Orientation is anchored immediately (“golden dock,” “Elara,” “snow”), and the single scene tightens coherently toward revelation without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woman’s tears and gift of thread reconfigure hope into memory, with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory layering and recurring motifs (thread, ship, garden), culminating in a cadence shift at the reading. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “absence a thread in the tapestry.”

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Kael’s discovery → descent → assembly → revelation forms a tight because/therefore chain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“beauty must be nurtured”—with undeniable cost: he accepts the flawed genesis rather than reversing it. The blue-lit cavern and machine’s voice crystallize stakes without deflation. Orientation is clear by line 30; the drive lens holds through to the Charged Poise ending where possibility replaces certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s planting reconfigures meaning, with cost legible in her stained hands and enduring whispers. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (black sand, coin, kelp) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty. The grafting act crystallizes stakes without false resolution, satisfying the Global Drive Lens with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s choice reconfigures the city’s forgotten heart, with visible cost in unstuck memories and revived fountains. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—breadcrumbs intensify density until the cascade at the climax. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“city of forgotten fountains,” Elara’s attic). The box’s mechanics are consistent, and the final image reweights all prior stillness as anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (petals, gear, light). Closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara redefines “light” as connection rather than combustion, with the garden’s transformation signaling irreversible change. However, cost remains abstract—the “weight of generations” is asserted but never concretized as sacrifice. The gear’s activation lacks causal friction; it responds instantly to thought, removing tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (butterflies, ribbon, glass panes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: grief as migration, not monument. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—Elara shifts from seeking a static “shape” to embracing creation as the shape itself. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of closure-as-solution and acceptance of ongoing carrying. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the greenhouse setting functions as a coherent microcosm.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (pendulum, inscriptions, obsidian ridge) until the final Charged Poise: Elias as pendulum bob. Closure is valid—a Resonant Reconfiguration where timekeeping becomes emotional stewardship—and cost is legible in the relinquishment of solitary precision for communal vulnerability. The “breath of time” pause functions as both structural hinge and thematic fulcrum. However, the middle section’s ripple effects (“a fisherman… a baker”) are told, not dramatized, softening escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, patterned imagery (“uncharted echoes,” stars mirroring constellations), and rhythmic cadence rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the tapestry reweights death as continuity of intention—with undeniable thematic cost. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Elias; where: cemetery; when: twilight). The chess clock’s freeze symbolizes time suspended for revelation, not a functional constraint, but this serves the lyric mode without harming coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds until the quill’s autonomous writing triggers transformation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the map becomes a call to action, reweighting the kingdom’s frozen reality with hope. However, causality falters: the quill “as if it had a mind of its own” introduces external agency that undercuts Ignorance’s earned authorship. Cost is implied (doubters ahead) but not felt in the moment of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sensory layering and the radio’s escalating glow until the broadcast crystallizes meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Clara’s stance reconfigures the room into a threshold, with cost felt in the silence left behind. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality isn’t required under this lens. One tightening (the song’s tempo slowing for transcription) suffices, though a second pressure point would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ash-scattering reweights “safety” as illusory yet meaningful, with cost legible in Elara’s weariness and the mask’s silent witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (mask, chair, ash) until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies. The rocking chair’s stop functions as both temporal anchor and emotional fulcrum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered reflections and recurring motifs until the Charged Poise of the ending reconfigures past/future as complementary. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the collapse inciting incident tightens stakes credibly. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “threads in the same tapestry” reweights the central conflict with conceptual cost (abandoning purity of preservation). However, the transition from sewer to ruins lacks causal friction—Kael’s shift feels narratively convenient rather than wrestled from prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes generative. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image reweights noise/silence with conceptual cost (the choir replaces indifference with resonance). Orientation is strong early; the library, autumn light, and rosette anchor setting and stakes cleanly. However, escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—growth is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, celestial timing, and symbolic pruning, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—hope as collective memory made edible. Orientation is immediate (“rusted greenhouse… chef named Elara”), and the closure lands with undeniable cost: Elara’s quiet labor replaces grand spectacle, foreclosing louder forms of rebellion. The celestial alignment functions as a taught constraint, not deus ex machina, and the seed’s growth responds directly to her intention. One flaw: the fruit’s effect is summarized rather than dramatized through another character’s changed behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s understanding of the drones’ sacrifice reweights the entire premise with social cost. The causal lens holds—each discovery (box, key, orb) follows from prior action—and the ending crystallizes Elara’s role with Charged Poise. However, the riddle’s sudden legibility and the orb’s instant vision delivery flirt with convenience, slightly softening the earnedness of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned discovery of displaced objects builds density until the shard’s glow binds them, culminating in Conceptual Repricing—Elias reweights forgotten things as sacred. Cost is legible in the final image: he now carries the burden of listening to hush, foreclosing ordinary indifference. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the closure crystallizes his stance without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the empty ampoule buried in the garden reweights the entire premise—certainty yields to nuance, and fragility becomes wisdom. The causal lens holds: Liora’s warning directly triggers Elara’s hesitation, which leads to adjusted testing and eventual success. Cost is legible in Elara’s fractured certainty and Liora’s quiet burden of connection. Orientation is immediate and vivid, with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights perpetual motion from physical obsession to philosophical ideal, with clear cost—the irreversible loss of the chipped die. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; density increases via recurring dice imagery and equation-laced walls, culminating in a cadence shift at the three-roll that crystallizes her renunciation. Orientation is anchored by line 3, and the staircase’s logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: lunar motifs, brush sensations, and smog-to-clarity shifts build density until the painting becomes a “bridge.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—the canvas remains glowing amid returning smog, crystallizing Elara’s new purpose with conceptual cost (the burden of remembering). Orientation is immediate (“rooftop greenhouse,” “Elara, an insomniac painter”), and the single scene holds spatial coherence. However, the inciting vision arrives via passive daydream rather than causal choice, slightly softening agency under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density (bioluminescent fungi, humming honey, emerald lens) builds until the communal tasting crystallizes change. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as laughter and song return, reweighting memory with undeniable cost (“as long as they remembered, they would never truly be displaced”). The lens’s chime and the bread’s effect are causally consistent within the established magical realism. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elias’s method (yoyo reverse-engineering) directly triggers the hunger stone’s activation, leading to a Decisive Change—the lighthouse gears turning counter-clockwise—and a Conceptual Repricing of time itself. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“rocky island,” “lighthouse,” “Elias”). Closure lands with Charged Poise: options are reconfigured (time bends), stakes crystallized, and cost implied (“no going back”). However, the yoyo’s mechanics aren’t dramatized mid-process, slightly weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through layered images (mirrors, clocks, luminance) rather than causal turns. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Clara redefines fear as needing acknowledgment—and cost is legible in the shattering mirrors and fading funhouse. However, the advisor’s late softening lacks sufficient motivation, and the transition from dream to resolution blurs causality. The pattern is taught early and pays off, but the lens wavers near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Leeward achieves Earned Stasis through musical interpretation, transforming restlessness into “restless euphony” with felt conceptual cost (the burden of perpetual listening). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and rhythmic cadence—but the fractal-cloud payoff arrives without prior mechanics, slightly undermining causality. Still, the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gate’s rust symbolizes systemic imbalance, not mere neglect. The voice reveals turtles are dying under the city’s weight—a reweighting of the world’s rules with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns intensify until the shell cracks, revealing truth. The inciting crack beneath Elara’s feet is perfectly timed and spatially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights noble lies not as pure tools of control but as human responses with cost, crystallized in the final image of the bare rosebush. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (rose, letter, ivy), culminating in a cadence shift at the archive’s discovery. Cost is legible: she abandons absolutism, bearing the weight of ambiguity. Orientation is anchored early; causality remains intact despite minimal external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (brine, silt, pulsing mosaic) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing—absence revalued as potent presence. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Elias’s note-sealing and the pavilion’s glow reconfigure memory as active restoration, with cost felt in his raw hands and soaked clothes. Orientation anchors immediately (“shore surveyor,” “lagoon,” “drawbridge”), and the single shard structure fits scope. The journal discovery tightens stakes by transforming abstract legend into urgent obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s truth reweights history, and the blackout’s end underscores earned revelation. However, causality leans on coincidence—the blackout “just happens” to enable discovery, and the stamp’s activation feels convenient rather than earned through prior mechanics. The map’s sudden appearance lacks setup, weakening the because/therefore chain under a Causal lens (inferred by midpoint). Cost is implied but not viscerally legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael renounces transformation-as-escape and embraces grief’s weight, foreclosing his old method with visible cost—the unfinished lantern, months of futile work. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist, light, and folded paper accrue meaning until the crane’s unfolding reweights everything. Cost is legible in “the first genuine smile in months”—a quiet but undeniable shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring crystal imagery that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: Zara redefines survival as active seeking. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who: Zara; where: observatory; when: post-strike). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the circuit breakers’ return marks a reconfigured stance with felt cost (loss of innocence, wedding, world). However, the “perturbation theory” pivot feels asserted rather than integrated into causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (find three pieces → activate chip), but escalation lacks narrowing stakes or foreclosed paths—each discovery is frictionless. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing (“fragments of himself”), yet cost is asserted, not shown: no visible sacrifice or irreversible loss on the page. Orientation is solid early, but the pilgrim’s offstage role weakens causal grounding. The lens is Causal, but pressure doesn’t tighten—it accumulates without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias returns to the terrace having crystallized his stance—no more lies—with the cost felt in his trembling body and the reclaimed watch sinking into sand. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with sensory density (cobalt tiles, sieved hush, driftwood carvings) intensifying toward the memory surfacing at the cracked clock carving. Orientation is clear by line 3; cause/effect flows through pattern accrual, not logic chains. Cost is legible in “the fractured pieces of his own soul” reflecting in the tiles.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawer pull passes hands, symbolizing a reconfigured stance where both nations occupy neutral ground without dominion. The moon’s waning phase and storm-worn parapet serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics. Cost is legible—Kael’s wounded pride endures, Elara’s hope is tempered by realism—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density builds through mist, object, and dialogue cadence until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated images (compass, poles, water) deepen in resonance rather than drive causal turns. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—as Mara tucks away the compass, accepting imperfection. Cost is legible in her “scarred” hull and “wobbling” legs, though the final hope feels slightly untethered from prior despair. Orientation is solid by line 30; the dawn launch anchors time, place, and POV without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density and symbolic layering build toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is solid by line 30 (“underground bioluminescent lake,” “after the procedure,” “Elias”). The baseball’s submersion triggers the pivotal deepening, and the final image reconfigures meaning with felt cost—Elias cannot return to who he was. However, the “labyrinth” metaphor arrives late without prior causal scaffolding, slightly weakening linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (spices, moonlight, fruit) builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elara accepts inner transformation. The closure lands with conceptual cost: she relinquishes the literal bond for self-reclamation. However, the guardian’s exposition (“the bond you desire is not what you remember”) borders on declarative guidance rather than earned discovery, slightly softening causality. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and symbolic recurrence until the saucer’s glow crystallizes lost moments. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: the crack transforms from wound to reminder, reweighting time’s fragility with felt cost (her nephew’s untouched hand). The glade’s early disorientation serves closure by mirroring Elara’s psychic state, waiving orientation penalties. Every beat tightens around the central stake—reclaiming presence—with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned imagery (tears, stitching, light) builds toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the portal’s opening relies on symbolic action without causal consequence—Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as deus ex machina, not earned mechanism. Cost is implied (“sorrow,” “scars”) but never dramatized as a tangible forfeiture tied to Elara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara becomes “the prophecy itself,” reweighting her role in the cosmos with felt cost (surrendering her cherished object). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory and celestial patterning until the archway moment crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clear by line 30; the detour functions as a taught deviation, not disorientation. However, the whispering hush resolves too cleanly, bordering on deus ex machina without prior causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a tight causal chain: blackout → sundial anomaly → key discovery → confrontation → activation. Orientation is immediate (“luminous fort at twilight,” “Elara… lock sentinel”), and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing via the cradle’s light as awakening, not weapon—lands with felt social cost. However, Thorne’s hesitation lacks sufficient groundwork, slightly weakening the climax’s inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Kael reweights reality itself—“all things were connected”—with felt cost (years of obsession, sanity’s edge). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density intensifies via aurora, eels, rocks, and dust until the climax reconfigures meaning. Orientation is solid by line 2 (“tidal bluff,” “Kael,” “aurora”). One tightening—the rock sequence as key—narrows options and crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, escalating through sensory density and symbolic layering rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes when they begin writing, reconfiguring silence into voice with felt cost (confronting scars). The storm, timer, and map cohere into a legible before/after, and the cost—returning to the self they fled—is embedded in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the overture redefined as the journey itself, with cost felt in Elias’s relinquishment of destination-seeking. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of prismatic light, brook sounds, and coded angles coalesce into thematic cadence. Sundial and needle card function as taught constraints, not late reveals. No causality breaks; every beat tightens toward the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of poetic imagery and thematic resonance builds toward a Charged Poise closure—the rooftop moment where rebuilding is affirmed as meaningful. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the coffee tin’s discovery functions as a micro-turn that deepens stakes. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive tightening—no option is foreclosed, no irreversible cost incurred. The ending reweights meaning (“patching is how we rebuild”) but doesn’t crystallize altered choices or legible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts fate not through reversal but reframing, with the ticking clock and stilled compasses signaling legible change. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and symbolic recurrence, not causality. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of control (“not with an encore, but with a new song”). Orientation is immediate, and the film-reel transition, while fantastical, is taught early and paid off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Elara seeks the seed because memory is fraying, climbs because of her dream, answers correctly, and plants the seed before the monsoon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the tree stands firm as memory is preserved. Cost is conceptual (risk of dissolution) but legible in the final image. However, the inciting urgency (“villagers misremembering”) isn’t dramatized, weakening causal pressure at the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (compass, lace, tides) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the “color of unspoken apologies” is revealed as something to release, not find. Closure is on-page, with visible cost—Elias leaves the compass and lace behind, lighter but forever changed. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality flows via pattern accrual, not event chain, which is valid for this lens.
