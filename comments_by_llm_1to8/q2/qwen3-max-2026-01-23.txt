  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (decision to encase rather than destroy), but the cost is asserted conceptually—no on-page forfeit, social price, or tactical narrowing dramatized in the canyon scene itself. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (frost → memory → resolution), yet the final transformation is told as intention rather than shown as a constraining act. One tightening occurs (from flight to decision), meeting minimal length requirements, but visible cost at closure remains absent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern (tuning fork ritual, heat-mapping) deepens until Liam's arrival reweights the stake from solitary translation to shared catharsis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes their silent communion with felt cost (permanent withdrawal from sound). Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara extends her method to another survivor, narrowing her solitary path and opening a relational one. The cost is legible: they trade the possibility of restored noise for connection in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through density and pattern (shard placement) culminating in a final radiance that reweights the library's silence into earned peace. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias achieves his vow with the cost legible in decades spent and the fragile equilibrium now stabilized. Orientation anchors (underwater library, bioluminescent fungi, Elias) arrive early. One weakness: the mechanical crab delivery and the lens's arrival feel convenience-plotted rather than causally seeded, but the ending transformation holds under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through repeated midnight runs, the motif of "amplified quiet," and the bell's transformation from silenced relic to covenant symbol. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the single chime and whispered declaration crystallize the community's new covenant with felt cost (the bell will not ring again for celebration). Orientation is clear by the arbor description in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena steadies Lin, shifting their dynamic and enabling the covenant moment, which reweights the runs from necessity to ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with breathing cycles deepening the obscura's revelations. Orientation arrives promptly (artist, viaduct, twilight, post-memory). However, closure rests on a conceptual repricing—"unused love is not a debt, but potential"—that is stated rather than dramatized through a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The golden light dissolving "like dandelion seeds" offers a pretty visual but no felt forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The resonance is asserted in the penultimate paragraph rather than landing through action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory texture, mystical objects, and geometric imagery toward a final repricing where "time's texture" is felt. Closure occurs on the page—the halo fragment disintegrates, releasing memory—but the cost is conceptual rather than decisively felt; Elara's transformation is delivered by external magic, not protagonist agency. Causality is present but relies on mystical mechanics introduced and resolved in one extended sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by line 26 (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through imagery (dust, bulldozer shadow, keys as celestial map) and cadence shifts rather than because/therefore causality. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vault's revelation transforms the crew's stance and crystallizes Elara's purpose with felt weight. However, the cost is largely asserted ("chains had never been a prison but roots") rather than enacted; no on-page choice forecloses a tangible path. The final image reweights prior material but does not show a visible sacrifice or trade-off, lowering closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by line 23; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through collected absences and sensory layering. Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (the coil pulse and epiphany reweight the stake). However, the cost is asserted ("a tear traced her cheek") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. The forge's glow and coil emergence feel convenient—no established constraint is overcome—and the final ascent declares change without showing what path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the moonbeam jar reweights the floral code, shifting from "Abandon this path" to "Follow the thorns to find your light." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure moment—Elara walking toward the forest path—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual ("no longer merely a thief") rather than felt as a visible forfeiture or trade-off. The reflective final paragraph ("reinterpreted not just a floral code, but her entire life's narrative") tells the transformation instead of letting the forest-path decision carry it alone, blunting the closure image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's glassblowing ritual layers sensory particulars and reflective beats toward a final image—the bookmark under the dome—that reweights brokenness as beauty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her stance and the piece explicitly names the cost ("had woven grief into purpose"). However, the cost feels asserted rather than viscerally paid; we're told her chest feels open and her thaw is complete without a scene-level trade-off that forecloses a path. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first 120 words, and the single-scene frame with one character fits scope defaults. The lens holds, but the closure image doesn't make the emotional or relational price undeniable on the page—it's narrated as already resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly and the causal lens is clear through the midpoint. The closure lands on the page—Elara modifies the shell, lures Silas away, and embraces vulnerability—but the cost remains asserted rather than viscerally felt: no forfeited path, no visible trade-off, only the declaration "we were brave together." The shell modification lacks mechanical specificity (how does etching a reverse star-path alter a tracker signal?) and Silas's defeat happens off-page, softening the decisive change. One meaningful tightening occurs when the journal reveals the shell's function, but the final image reconfigures options more through statement than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around intensifying density—gravel settling, meltwater drip, wolf cry—building toward the completed map as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (ridge fort, storm aftermath, oracle at work). The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost (the map as testament, warm weight against heart), and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (the cartography itself) is sufficient at this length, though the cost remains felt rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation by ~100 words and teaches its loop structure early. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Unit Seven accepts repetition as pedagogical sanctuary with "serene clarity" and newfound purpose. The cost is conceptual—forty-three loops spent to learn that "thoughts emerge from amalgamation"—but the final image of standing sentinel under freely flowing time reweights prior material. The decisive shift from temporal prison to sanctuary of presence lands on the page, though the price feels abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through nightly ticket-gathering, lens use, and the climactic projection that transforms the forecourt into "a gallery of shared vulnerability." Orientation anchors (Elara, forecourt, post-verbal era) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael's gesture and the subsequent ticket exchange constitute Earned Stasis (isolation renounced) with felt relational cost. However, cost legibility is soft: Kael's "fortress of isolation crumbled" and Elara's realization ("honesty was not about perfect clarity") are told rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical constraint. The ending deepens the pattern (tickets as seeds, crystals hum agreement) but the conceptual price—what Elara or Kael visibly sacrificed—remains oblique, capping closure strength.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is solid (who, where, when by the opening beats), and the causal lens is stable: Elara's polishing ritual frames the confrontation, and the maze's response to Kael's closed heart follows from established lore (the Great Frost backstory, prior marbles). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the maze knows her name, honoring the covenant—with a conceptual cost legible in the contrast between her "scars" and Kael's cracked meter. However, the cost at the ending remains largely implied; the final paragraph ("every crack…beautifully, completely mended") tells more than it shows, and the maze's sentient agency arrives late without prior on-page demonstration. One meaningful tightening (the confrontation) is present, but the turn lacks a second beat of Elara choosing under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric density builds toward a cadence shift at the hologram activation, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes Kael's stance and the zephyrs' communion with visible conceptual cost (surrendered doubt, acceptance of listening over proving). Orientation anchors are present early (ridge, station, Kael's role). The closure effect lands on the page with felt cost, though the cost is more contemplative than action-driven. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hologram reveals the lattice and the zephyrs respond, reweighting Kael's relationship to his work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: water-stain images accumulate meaning until the final fermata symbol crystallizes the ghost's acknowledgment, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (acknowledgment as shared moment). Orientation anchors who/where/when early and the closure lands on the page with a felt shift from "void of loss" to "bridge of understanding." However, the cost remains largely asserted rather than dramatically visible—Elias does not sacrifice a concrete option or endure a legible price; the warmth and peace arrive without trade-off. The escalation is more atmospheric than causal, and the final beat's transformation is told more than shown in a decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: perception fragments accrue density until the smudge revelation reweights the dominant stake (guilt over Kael's death). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara's acceptance of the margin, transformed fault-tolerance, and embodied grief constitute a stance crystallization with felt cost (the stone of remorse becomes an anchor). Orientation anchors promptly (weather station, post-fever dawn, alone). The causality is clean: fever strips certainty → peripherally aware gaze finds smudge → memory surfaces → tear clarifies hidden bud → aurora witnesses transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds throughout: phone confession → recordings → Eleanor's description → tunnel discovery → wheel触 → truth understood → resolve to speak. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding shifts from blame to grace) with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors quickly (Leo, tunnel, post-confession). One meaningful deepening occurs when tactile contact crystallizes understanding, narrowing his stance from skepticism to witness. The backstory block is substantial but changes present resolve, meeting BRR expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is present (who, where, when), but the piece lacks an on-page closure with felt cost. The tremor signals a journey, the journey occurs, Elara observes the refuge, inscribes a line, and returns—no decision alters options or forecloses a path. The sapling's appearance and the inscription are observations, not decisive changes or renunciations with visible price. Under an inferred Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image would need to reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; instead, it restates the premise ("transformation's gentle, inevitable flow") without cost. The structure is a travelogue: descent, witness, return, with no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds through music, shared silence, and the eclipse's atmospheric shift to reweight the therapeutic encounter. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (therapist, oak, Liam). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Liam's wonder reawakened), but the cost is nearly invisible—Elara gives away the curl temporarily with no felt sacrifice, and retrieves it moments later. The "link" remains abstract; we see Liam's response but not what Elara forfeited or risked to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory fragments (laughter, argument, Elara's diary) and the tapestry to deepen the resonance of the silo's archive. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the displaced axis had shifted the world, but stories, like dragons, could mend the sky in memory" crystallizes the stakes and reweights the archive's purpose with conceptual cost (the dream-space must be tended against oblivion). However, the cost is more asserted than viscerally legible on the page—no forfeited path or visible price paid in the final beat. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by line 3).

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas shifts from orchestration-by-cipher to honest vulnerability, and the final image (Elara's hand, the stone, the apology) reweights the entire premise with visible relational cost. The drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid: Silas's plan and its undercutting by Elara's early arrival follow clear because/therefore links, though the microdot's irrelevance is a micro turn rather than a full reversal. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (lighthouse study, after last orders). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara arrives holding the wrapper, revealing the open secret's power and collapsing Silas's hidden-image strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early: looped voice, decorated silence, rhetorical scalpels build density until the palette's hidden latch clicks open—a micro turn that earns Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph without delay. The cost is legible: Elara's solitude-as-strength assumption shatters on the page, and the mixing of crimson into cobalt is a before/after with felt price. One escalation beat (dimensional static, window flicker) tightens time pressure, satisfying the one-meaningful-deepening threshold for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: memory-mapping gathers density through the nautilus ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the mirrored horizon reveals the barn and hawk, reweighting her homesickness as resource rather than wound. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who: Elara; where: glass spire/frozen lake; when: pre-dawn). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost—she will "change" the fortunes, altering her daily practice—though the cost reads more as affirmation than sacrifice. One minor slip: the "dizziness warned her—exhaustion neared" beat signals a tightening constraint that never meaningfully restricts her final mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is absent past 120 words: who Elara is beyond her ability, where the viaduct exists in space or time, and when this occurs remain unclear throughout. The closure—releasing the tablet with acceptance—arrives as a stated shift ("I accept all that I am") without prior dramatized cost or a visible trade-off that would make the before/after legible. The fractured timelines are described repeatedly but never constrain a specific on-page choice; the procedural generation functions as narrated scenery rather than a mechanism that alters tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and the drum's vibrations layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara moves from numbness to aliveness). Closure is on the page and the cost is felt emotionally, though the mechanics arrive late (phonograph method introduced past the 40% mark) and the final image leans heavily on assertion ("no longer defined by absence") rather than a concrete action or choice that forecloses a path. Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when vibration bypasses deafness, but the turn is delivered to her rather than earned through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 3). The drive lens reads as Causal with Situational coloring: the crimson clay token prompts her intuition, which narrows her options to lateral encoding rather than flight or silence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she transforms intrusion into opportunity, the courtyard deepens into "fortified calm," and the final "anchoring" image crystallizes her stance with felt cost (ongoing exposure, no safety). One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the clay is a probe, not a threat, reweighting her tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words; the grotto, starlight, and post-energy-beings timeframe are clear. The accumulative lens holds: each paragraph deepens sensory and temporal layers until the conceptual repricing lands. Cost is legible—he foregoes the descent and physical proof—but the price feels more conceptual than viscerally felt. The piece teaches its pattern early (uncovering layers) and pays it off, though the closure leans heavily on whispered assertion ("Time is the scar and the suture") rather than image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered imagery (bowl, violin, greenhouse, shipwrecks) toward a final reconfiguration where silence becomes "companion holding space." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the chronic hush transforms from enemy to companion), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page choice was foreclosed, no tactical option narrowed. The ending reweights the premise conceptually but lacks the felt price required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (who/where/when by the opening lines). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through static-buzz intensification, petal handling, and the twilight→night transformation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Kael is "remade," his work will change), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, relationship loss, or tangible price paid on the page. The final paragraph ("he was a bridge") summarizes the shift instead of showing a before/after in action or stakes. The ending lands coherently under the accumulative lens but the felt cost remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the garden paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of gratitude seeded → note drafted → cycle initiated). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights Elias's career through the "compassion as cargo" metaphor and the note en route. Cost is conceptual (decades overlooked) rather than felt in the moment, and the piece teaches the pattern early. One weakness: the mistaken address functions as setup coincidence but does not constrain later choices—it triggers the meeting but then vanishes, reducing causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through shared search and converges at the obsidian arbor discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's dedication and Kael's acknowledgment ("The graft has taken root") crystallize belonging with felt cost (decades of solitude, her prior rootlessness). However, the cost is more asserted than dramatized—Kael's tear and Elara's kneeling are gestures, but no prior choice or renunciation on the page forecloses a live option or visibly alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words, meeting the test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered world-detail and metaphor until the cage-breaking moment, then reconfigures via the echo's release and Elara's vow to illustrate memory. However, closure cost is asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, injury, or foreclosed option appears; the pendant cools, the city wakes, and she rows home enriched. The final image reweights the premise conceptually (echoes liberated, canals singing anew) but the felt cost required for CR or RR remains invisible on the page, failing the Cost Proof Test by ~0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts Kael's integration into the orchard rather than pursuing further conjuring, and the drop's return signals continuity. Cost is visible—she relinquishes the search for discrete answers and accepts transformation over retrieval. One deduction: the vision sequence summarizes Kael's choice rather than dramatizing a present discovery that narrows Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elara steps from shadow into dawn light, crystallizing the cost of visibility after twelve years of isolation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sense memories and spatial detail, culminating in a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first ~100 words. The cost is legible: she forecloses her hidden sanctuary to extend connection, and Evans' recognition makes the visibility irreversible. One meaningful tightening occurs when Evans lifts her gaze and names Elara, forcing the final step into light.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara shifts from "commander to companion." The closure lands on-page with a felt cost (releasing control, awaiting storms with curiosity rather than dread), and the final image reweights the opening mossy trellis. One meaningful deepening occurs through the linden-leaf insight that alters her tactics (leaving damage, planting with change). The lens holds, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The rain-trail pilgrimage accumulates density through layered images (cairn, unearthed foundation, brooch exchange, heartstone) that converge at the painted closure where Elias understands memory as "a current...meant to carry it only for a season." Orientation is clear (tidal island, post-water-wars painter). The ending lands Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: insomnia as vigil fulfilled) with visible cost (seventeen years of wakefulness exchanged for first sleep). One concern: Elara's sudden appearance at the convergence site reads slightly coincidental, though her thematic role as historian carrying legacy forward justifies her presence under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece offers an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's acceptance of unknowing). Orientation is late: who Elara is and what she seeks emerge gradually through exposition rather than anchored action by ~120 words, though the cave setting anchors early. The closure moment—"she had not seen it coming, and in that surrender, she found deeper magic"—lands as a conceptual repricing, but cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the "before/after" legible with felt consequence. The pilgrim's arrival and the pearl ritual proceed without a meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative lens: Elara restores fragments and distributes them in staggered intervals, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where her method is affirmed by Elder Lin and she commits to the next fragment. Orientation anchors quickly (Ivory Harbor, post-exile, archivist role by ~80 words). The closure lands as Charged Poise—she has not erased absences but navigated them, and the child's drawing awaits—yet the cost is largely conceptual and Elder Lin's affirmation feels more like validation than friction. The meaningful tightening occurs across the week of offerings, but the final beat could press harder against resistance or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cracks → booth → punch → map-hole accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening third. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the fortress is revealed as internal—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture crystallizes what Elara loses by accepting this truth. The map's surrender could have been irreversible (a real letting-go), but its careful folding afterward softens the price. One meaningful deepening (arrival at booth, punch moment, realization) satisfies length, yet the final image doesn't land with undeniable pressure because the transformation is told rather than shown through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory intensity builds through the tile vision, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the transcription on the wall and Liam finds solace. Orientation anchors (tower, night, whale migration) arrive promptly. However, the closure cost is conceptual and relational rather than viscerally felt on the page—Elara's tears and the "palpable warmth" are asserted more than shown through a decisive forfeiture or tactical shift. The tile's cooling "its purpose fulfilled" reads as convenient resolution rather than a price Elara pays.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (prismatic imagery, magnetic field metaphors, memory flashes). Orientation anchors appear early (who/where). However, closure arrives as told revelation ("This was the after") rather than a dramatized beat that reweights prior material. The amulet "dissolved," the tear "sealed," and Kaelen "stood again"—all passive summarized outcomes with no visible cost on the page. The "library woven from solidified light" is described but not tested; no choice is made there, no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ink pot, prep room atmosphere, and reflective writing accumulate toward a conceptual repricing where "fair trade" is redefined as integration rather than subtraction. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. However, the closure unit—Elara's proposal and promise to honor complexity without inheriting deceptions—is more told than dramatized; the cost (leaving her father's world, facing credible threats) is declared but not felt in a concrete image or forfeited action on the page, reading closer to summary than a charged final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: dawn charting becomes the frame for invented histories, and the final gold-leaf forest image reweights the opening labyrinth with undeniable resonance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise: "every leaf whispered a story waiting to be charted") lands with conceptual cost—silence transformed into continuous creative obligation—but the cost reads as affirmed devotion rather than a visible forfeiture or narrowing of options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-taught layering of fragments toward a final reconfiguration). The piece signals its method early—collecting and layering—and the poison label arrival at the midpoint deepens the protagonist's archival practice by adding Dr. Aris Thorne's story. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist finds rhythm and purpose in witnessing, the final image crystallizes his stance. However, the cost is oblique—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page, only the assertion that he has "found his rhythm." The tidal structure provides temporal scaffolding, but the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off that would elevate closure into high bands. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: memory, hum, shell, and cello accumulate toward a thematic reweighting. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, present-day quest) land early. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"love is the true ephemeral compass"—but the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page marks a before/after with felt price. The piece teaches its reflective, lyric pattern and the final image reweights prior material, satisfying the lens. However, the grandfather's voice returns too cleanly via the cello's hum without dramatized friction or cost, reducing closure sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the graffiti network builds density through the night, culminating in community adoption at dawn. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Kael's balance of dual allegiance and the community's encoded resistance before OmniCorp's noon arrival—with felt cost (fragile hope, vigilance demanded). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The cost is present but somewhat muted; "fragile hope" and "weary yet certain" soften what should land as undeniable pressure at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the night vigil, the dawning hush deepens the stake, and the final image reweights prior material. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the photograph is secured, the old world ends, the new begins—with felt cost visible in "the crater… would not outlast the relentless progress of the coming day." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The single meaningful tightening (moon dips → dawning hush → first light) is sufficient for this length and coheres under the chosen lens. Cost is legible on the page in the final contrast between Kael's endurance and the crater's imminent destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens through the water-basin ritual. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: her covenant with her method persists), but the cost remains conceptual and retrospective rather than legibly felt on the page. The repair succeeds without complication, and the final image recycles the opening's "magnetic calm" and water symbolism without a decisive reweighting or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation pattern, falcon flight path, and phrasebook converge to reweight Elara's understanding of river origins. Orientation anchors quickly (outpost, frozen lake, after falcon returns). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—"she would drill" crystallizes intent, and the final footnote image reconfigures her cartographic project with conceptual cost (rejecting "settled science," accepting solitude). The cost is felt but oblique; the story stops at commitment rather than consequence, which keeps it shy of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonant images (water drop, phantom ember, translucent figures) toward a final reconfiguration where "shared balance was restored." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the town revived to "serene sanctuary"), but the cost is asserted ("collapse averted") rather than shown through a visible forfeit or altered option on the page. Orientation anchors are present early (Elara, archway, ghost town), and the pattern of footfall-driven restoration is taught and held, but the final beat lacks a concrete price paid—no choice forecloses a path, no tangible loss appears.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Aris surrenders with the memory preserved, foreclosing his survival with visible cost. The causal lens holds throughout—descend, unsnarl with patience, secure vial, accept death. Orientation anchors quickly (underwater temple, failing oxygen, distress beacon). One meaningful tightening occurs when the oxygen alarm forces him to override instinct at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, Kael, present moment) land within the first ~100 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: copperlight imagery, scuff-lattice motif, and the son-of-wolf legacy build density toward the final reconfiguration. However, closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (trust restored, barrier fallen) but the felt cost—what Kael forfeits or endures on the page—remains abstract; "the real barrier had already fallen" is asserted rather than shown through a legible trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: the ghost bride performs resonant awakenings in sequence, building toward the Heartwood climax. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, winter fields, dying Elias) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (her dissolution as debt repaid, Elias stepping into the transformed orchard), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—she smiles in "profound peace" and scatters into light without visible struggle or foreclosed alternative. The extensive backstory (betrothal, poisoned cup, alchemist's vow) provides causal setup but the present-tense sequence functions more as ritual execution than pressure-driven escalation, weakening the tightening required for the accumulative lens to charge the ending fully.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara enters the labyrinth, follows her sleepwalking paths, and sews the thread to completion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure—tying thread to the resilient orchid—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reverence earned through embodied action), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("broken precedents were alchemized") rather than felt on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the sewing proceeds as planned from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (roots/bones, sundial fragments, shadow alignment) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at noon when the shadow touches the tomb door. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure—Elara's acceptance and her decision to tend the orchard—lands on the page with felt cost (exile transformed into return, broken ritual made whole), though the cost is more asserted through metaphor than dramatized through a specific forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is (pseudonym creator), what she's doing (finalizing a signature), and why it matters emerge gradually across the first third without concrete stakes. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the chalk code simply hands her a solution. Closure is a Conceptual Reprising (the margin speaks), yet cost is absent: she feels "lighter," the letter is mailed, and no path is foreclosed. The ending reconfigures meaning thematically but lacks visible or felt price on the page, failing the Cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 50; the Drive Lens reads Causal (discovery of Vega misplacement → thread divination → corrected chart → delivery to captain). One meaningful tightening occurs when the thread reveals the conspiracy's full scope (lines 139–172), narrowing Elara's options from "raise alarm" to "silent correction." Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps into the mist carrying truth toward justice, the cost felt in her solitary risk and the observatory's sigh of relief. The candle's final dip provides resonance. No causality breaks, though the midnight-to-dawn compression elides the captain-delivery beat, leaving closure one step before full consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and motifs (spirits, shard, condensation) toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (emotional healing via witnessed forgiveness), but the cost is abstract—"weight vanished" without a visible forfeiture or path foreclosed. The shard's mechanics (heals in moonlight, evokes memory) are asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (vision of Lena's waiting love), sufficient for length, but the "already forgiven" revelation arrives without prior friction or protagonist agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (Anahera, atrium, sleeping Leo, cast) and builds density through interleaved memory and present decryption. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): placing the coral beside the cast and whispering comfort crystallizes her shift from armored wound to connective purpose, with the cost felt in her acknowledgment of "every anxious soul she'd ever failed to comfort." The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical change, but the final image reweights her solitary Pacific grief as "a fragile, unbreakable cord" to Leo's urban fear. One modest deduction: the climactic whisper and coral placement are stacked with interpretive summary ("This was the lotus-hearted ache…") that slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered imagery (fog, light, fresco) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words (orchard district, fog, Elara as artist). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the daydream's luminous resurrection and the fragment's placement create a charged final image that reweights her relationship to loss. Cost is present but oblique—she leaves the fragment embedded, a gesture that closes the circle but does not foreclose a competing desire on the page. One meaningful deepening (the fresco blooms) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds. The cost could be more visceral to elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is adequate (who/where anchored early), but the closure unit reads as summarized epiphany rather than decisive change with on-page cost. The three nested awakenings are recounted sequentially in exposition ("This was the first awakening... A second... A third"), not dramatized as causal turns that narrow options. The final act—returning the nickel and writing three words—feels declarative rather than a moment where a path is foreclosed with felt price. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-led revelation), but the pattern is asserted, not built through concrete beats that reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through botanical cipher, cicada calls, and converging members. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("defiance was not a solitary act, but a garden tended together"), but the final image relies on assertion ("the entire city would feel its warmth") rather than a concrete on-page change or felt cost. The gourd seed's maturation and the moonrise "warp" are setup but not paid off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who, where, centuries-long when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shell's light bloom acknowledges his longing and the poet rests in acceptance), but cost remains oblique—what path is foreclosed, what is sacrificed for this peace? The escalation relies on mystical resonance triggered by his song rather than prior causal pressure or a tightening choice. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the shell transforms from refuge to living archive), but the final image's cost is felt rather than concretely legible, keeping this in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dawn triggers the chime, orchids capture names—but no meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual completes exactly as planned with no reversal, complication, or visible cost. Closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the protagonist simply continues her routine tomorrow. The ending offers theme assertion ("remembrance...is the highest form of love") rather than an on-page cost or reweighted image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elara's method (interconnected promises via moonstone ink) unlocks the Codex, which provides the translation that repairs trust with Kael. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—trust restored and paths converging—with felt relational cost (the ninety-seven days of silence, the weight of impending division). One minor causality slip: the ink "said to glow when tracing a sincere promise" functions more as convenient magic than earned constraint, but the piece teaches this rule early and applies it consistently, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly and follows a causal chain: discover envelope → decode cipher → place vents → mountain exhales → success. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the surveyor's chain left behind, two factions reconciled). The middle deepens when the architect's message reframes the task, and the vents' success validates Kael's synthesis. Minor orientation debt in the opening (caldera/amphitheater spatial relation takes ~50 words to settle) does not obscure the arc, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust motes, paper trails, and the meteorite accumulate meaning across the piece. Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elias," "vintage bookshop attic," and his pigeon-trainer past only through embedded backstory, arriving past the 120-word mark without spatial grounding (−0.4). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): writing truth and deciding to share with Clara reweights his solitude with conceptual cost, though the cost is asserted more than dramatized. The accumulative pattern holds, but late orientation and abstract cost language prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of necessary distances), but cost remains entirely abstract—no on-page action, forfeiture, or altered tactic demonstrates what Elara gives up or what path she forecloses. The piece is retrospective meditation rather than present-scene pressure; the logbook entry and mother's disappearance anchor the reflection, but no causal turn tightens options in the present. Orientation is clear (who, where, when by the opening), but the drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative texture competes with a causal framing that never delivers because/therefore linkage in the present scene. The final image ("fractured hush settled around her like a blessing") reweights prior material conceptually but without felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (underwater facility, sextant, burnt feather). The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image (anemones, kelp, fireflies) and a cadence shift at sunrise. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara releases the feather and recognizes belonging as practice—but the cost is asserted ("no longer a relic of loss, but a promise of release") rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or narrowed option. The firefly reprise reweights prior material, yet the final insight reads more like thematic summary than a legible on-page alteration of stance or circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early—sensory density, pattern recognition, and image recursion—and holds it through closure. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who: Elara; where: crystal geode cave; when: present urgent investigation). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image of "seeds of memory traveling to nourish tomorrow" reweights the opening mystery with felt cost (her acceptance of transience). One meaningful deepening occurs when the wedding-feast path dissolves into sparks, shifting her understanding from loss to release. The causality is motivated through her method (seed planting + glass testing), though the bird's early return feels slightly convenient as validation rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through precise environmental detail, ritual placement, and the payoff when starlight hits the bishop at the predicted moment. Orientation anchors clearly (tidal arcade, between acts, Corbin on bench) within the first paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the man's transformed gait and Corbin's reinforced conviction), with the cost felt in the bishop's permanent departure and the validation of his "quiet life's work." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the coincidence of the man finding precisely what he needs edges toward convenience despite the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (twilight garden, Elara, post-ban world) and delivers an on-page closure: Elara's spontaneous anchor dissolves after she completes the verse, and Kael departs with resolve—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the cost is felt in Elara's solitude and purpose fulfilled. However, the lens is ambiguous: the opening suggests Accumulative/Textural (gaps, poetry, observation), but the closure reads more Causal (act completes, anchor releases). The release itself lacks visible friction—no moment where Elara resists or mourns the dissolution—so the cost reads asserted rather than dramatized. The drive coheres loosely but does not tighten under a single method.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the pond ritual gathers meaning through layered perception (rings, light, prism colors) and ends with Elara carrying "a silent, luminous truth" into the waking day. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the shift from contemplation to active grace, but cost remains oblique—her purpose is "renewed," not altered or foreclosed. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), and the lens holds, but the final image reweights prior material only softly; no visible price or constraint emerges on the page. One tightening occurs (sun piercing mist, atrium revealed), sufficient for length, yet the reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where early (firefighter, ridge path, moonlit night); the dominant stake—fulfilling the bargain by understanding innocence—is signaled and pursued. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece deepens through layered reflection and the porcelain box's symbolic weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (enlightenment and acceptance that innocence transforms rather than remains pristine). However, the cost is felt primarily as conceptual repricing rather than a visible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page; the final walk down with the box "secure against his chest" reweights meaning but lacks a sharp before/after with tangible sacrifice. The closure is legible but soft, relying on thematic assertion ("bargain fulfilled") more than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout the grotto scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers decorative pattern → lucid observation → gauge reading → journal notation in a recurring ritual cadence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: "Tomorrow, new shells, refined equations, the same lucidly watchful dedication would return"), but the cost is asserted rather than shown on the page—no choice is foreclosed, no tactic altered by prior failure. The final image restates the opening premise without reweighting it through a dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through discovery beats (passage → fireplace → diaries → film negative) that layer meaning toward a thematic reconfiguration at the end. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; when is signaled ("after the climate shifts") but remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—legacy shifts from sorrow alone to honoring both joy and grief—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation makes the weight tangible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative reweights the diaries' despair, satisfying minimal escalation for this length and lens, but the felt price is asserted ("heart heavier yet clearer") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates imagery and mirrors transform sequentially, but the closure lacks visible cost—the painter fades "with the gentle inevitability of sunset" without any on-page trade-off or reweighted meaning. The final image of the child smiling feels like a thematic assertion rather than a dramatic reconfiguration. Orientation is clean, and the prism-light-mirror sequence follows accumulative logic, but the ending resolves into sentimentality without the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritual significance and the treaty-signing accumulate pressure toward the final departure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Kaelen's resignation forecloses his role with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when his confession shifts the elder's stance, narrowing options and enabling the signing. Cost is legible in "walked away from the negotiator's title, the war, the weight" and the certainty that peace "could outlive the hands that planted them." The lens holds and closure lands on the page with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: Silas releases the egg, surrendering memory to the land with visible cost (the tear, the kneeling posture, the walk away without looking back). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through density of image and cadence shift at the star convergence. Orientation is swift (salt flat, Silas, present tense of pilgrimage by line 3). One meaningful deepening occurs when he kneels and unwraps the egg, narrowing options to irrevocable release. Cost is legible on the page: he walks away having forfeited possession and privacy of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: untangling threads deepens pressure through density and cadence shifts until the prism unlocks. Closure arrives on-page (the sanctuary opens, echoes disperse), but the cost—what Elara sacrificed or what path she foreclosed—remains implied rather than legible in the final image. The "sigh to smile" timeframe recurs but does not tighten options causally; the escalation reads as texture accumulation without a clear trade-off at the peak. The narrative fulfills its stated task cleanly, yet lacks a decisive before/after that makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and maintains a single POV throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through reflection and image-pattern (meteor hush, story stick, dome's listening function) rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's resolve crystallizes in the final paragraphs, and the cost is conceptual—surrendering ego and control—made legible through the shift from puppet stage to transcription circle. The second half drifts into future-tense summary ("He would sit," "He would begin tonight"), which softens the immediacy of the ending and places much of the closure in intention rather than on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening window. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's ritual accumulates particulars (weaving, whispering extinct names, pressing the moth wing) until the monarch's arrival interrupts the cadence and she pivots to care. That pivot—untying the signal knot to splint the wing—reweights her method from communication to compassion, a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR). Cost is implied (the signal never reaches "heavens" but "memory itself"), yet the final image doesn't make the trade-off undeniable; the structures remain, the butterfly departs healed, and Elara walks on enriched rather than diminished.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the rope-reconfiguration ritual accumulates pressure through patient detail until the aurora-triggered illumination reweights the sanctum's function. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ice archive shifts from tomb to living repository) with conceptual cost legible in the final image—Elara becomes a keeper of echoes, her purpose redefined. Orientation anchors (sanctum, aurora, rope, punched card) arrive early. One deduction: the middle ritual beats feel more like procedural checklist than a meaningful tightening that narrows options or raises felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (bunker, storm, Elara). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers mystical imagery toward transcendence rather than causal linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she gains present-moment awareness and steps onto the glowing path), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or trade-off dramatized on the page. The wafer-seal breaking triggers the dream sequence without prior setup of mechanics, reading as a solve-button rather than earned escalation under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—aligning the tile to reveal the hidden star chart—drives toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (internal homecoming), but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the tile glows, warmth flows, and Enlil feels "answered" without forfeiting an alternate path or paying a dramatized price. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (twenty years of preparation, patient overlay, final alignment), yet the ending delivers emotional affirmation without the reweighting of prior material or cadence shift that would charge the image. "A permanent map of belonging" is told, not shown through tactical change or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's release of resentment, but the closure lacks visible cost—he walks out "unburdened" without forfeiting anything on the page. The orientation is delayed (sanctuary context unclear until Kael arrives; "shifting reality" remains abstract decoration). Causality follows an Accumulative lens through guided memory, but Elara's years of "planting triggers" are told in summary, not dramatized, weakening the earned quality of the final shift. The reappearing pin offers a micro-turn but its mechanics (why now?) remain unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is legible early (ruined orchard, mirror maker, astronomer's sextant), and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fog luminescence and dream approach build density toward the sextant's transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the dream enters the glass, fog parts to reveal a star, and the bud swells—but cost is oblique: Elara "remained firmly grounded," and no on-page sentence shows what she has forfeited or how her options have narrowed. The phrase "glass mountains of her resolve had not shattered; they had become windows" asserts transformation without dramatizing a before/after choice that forecloses a path. The sequence coheres under its lens but the cost is felt only if the reader infers that sanctuary = loss of agency or future vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the orchard, ribbon, and repair beats accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (mother and daughter reconciled, "deciduous vows" reweighted). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit (Lyra's arrival, mutual recognition, shoulder-to-shoulder on the pew) lands on the page with felt emotional cost, but the conceptual cost—what Elara or Lyra forfeit or alter in tactics—remains oblique; the ribbon's reweighting is more symbolic echo than a constraint that forced a different choice. One meaningful deepening (the ribbon's repurposing) tightens stakes, satisfying the lens, but the final image ("deciduous vow, shed and renewed") leans toward thematic declaration rather than charged particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a resonance pattern early (blossoms respond, ledger evolves) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the cameo fills and the ledger's final page mirrors the artifact, reweighting prior bewilderment into "sacred trust." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from extraction to exchange. Cost is conceptual (forbidden knowledge becomes burden) and legible in "solemn weight of stewardship," though the price feels more asserted than dramatized with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the botanical diary's gaps accumulate meaning, the vine sprouts from honesty, and the final library descent reweights "unlearned lessons" as invitations. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the closure unit—Elara's realization that she tends gardens rather than seeks a library—is asserted in summary ("she understood her motivation had transformed") without a prior on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The Warden steps aside after her declaration, but we do not see Elara choose to stay or renounce another option; the final walk-back is reflective gloss rather than a decisive reconfiguration with felt price. Kael's rescue completes off-stage (he vanishes), so the rescue-mission stake resolves without her visible sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memory alteration, recurring emerald card, fog as metaphor for recollection's instability). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Lyra releases the card, accepts loss, becomes "the gardener")—renunciation with felt cost, though the cost is more asserted than shown in a decisive beat. Orientation is clean early (who, where, stakes by ~10% in). However, the journal entry at the climax delivers the pivotal insight via exposition rather than scene pressure, softening the closure's causal weight. The piece signals its lens and holds it, but the ending's heaviest lifting occurs in summary reflection rather than a charged image that reweights prior material without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first third. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered description, the ceremonial rope serves as a physical chronicle, and the closure reconfigures the anomaly by integrating absence into the weave. However, the decisive action—securing the final strand—triggers the resolution almost mechanically; the door vanishes, gears resume, clarity arrives without a felt price beyond the procedural act itself. The cost reads conceptual (honoring loss) but the on-page image of the door shimmering away lacks emotional or tactical sacrifice that would anchor a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric patterning; the protagonist's descent, investigation of ice cracks, recognition of trapped silence, and use of the stone follow motivated linkage. The closure—bloom of hush expanding—is on the page with a decisive change (chaos to peace) and visible cost in the form of three days' ordeal plus the protagonist's exhaustion. Orientation is immediate (Kael, caves, post-arrival chaos). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael finds the luminous fracture and acts. The cost is primarily retrospective (tension draining, weariness) rather than a live trade-off at the closure beat itself, which keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (who, where, when established early). The piece follows a Causal lens: Elara's tracking leads to the alignment, which enables the rekindling. However, the decisive turn—Master Aris's vision providing the exact method—arrives via retrocognitive echo rather than protagonist agency, softening the causal spine. The closure is a Decisive Change (beacon rekindled, lights answer across the valley) with felt emotional cost (thirty years, tears) but the resolution depends on following inherited instructions rather than a choice that narrows options. Cost is legible but the protagonist's final moves execute a script rather than transform under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The dominant stake—preserving collective memory and bridging past to future—is signaled early and held through to the glow-and-whisper closure. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: shadow observations and storm imagery build density that culminates in the blooming fissure and bone-deep whisper. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the collective memory accepts her thread), but the felt cost is thin—tears of belonging suggest reward rather than sacrifice, and no prior path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: Elara seeks the mosaic, uses the knot to reveal it, and translates the message into resolve. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (who, where, when). However, the closure moment—her vow to carry the design into the world—reads as thematic affirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost on the page; the "oppressive gravity of hopelessness" dissolves without dramatized forfeit or sacrifice. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara gives up or risks in her final beat, only what she gains.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates tidal-pool imagery and deepens through Elara's observant pause, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—her refusal to argue, her patience) that reweights the sibling conflict. Orientation is clear early (grotto, stars, sibling pair). Cost is present but muted: Elara's patience forecloses confrontation, Kael's tear signals vulnerability. One meaningful deepening occurs when her tangential method unlocks insight. The final exchange provides closure, though the cost feels more emotional than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara waits, gravity inverts, the gilded hush arrives, she collects it, and descends with the cure—a deepening via density increase and cadence shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she has found her antidote and rewritten her relationship with space, evidenced by the sprout offering and carried silence. Cost is felt (old wound healed, doll relinquished, vulnerability to open sky accepted). Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the accumulative mode sacrifices causal tightening for lyric resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with strong orientation (who, where, when by the first paragraph) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Leo's recognition that "the quiet feels like her now" reweights his relationship to silence with visible emotional cost (the tear, the shift from anguish to tender recognition). However, the drive lens is ambiguous: the storm glass vial suggests a textural/accumulative design (monitoring noise as a gathering pattern), but the narrative also attempts causal linkage through Elara's teaching moves. The closure effect is legible but quiet, and the cost—Leo's acceptance of grief within stillness—is felt rather than decisive. Under either lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, meeting the 600–800 word threshold, but the grandmother note feels like a late convenience rather than a constraint established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the waterfall threshold, but the drive lens remains ambiguous: it gestures toward Causal (ruby flake → mural → staircase) yet resolves via Conceptual Repricing without clear cost legibility. The dominant stake—finding the stairway before dawn—is signaled early, but the final pivot (turning away from the staircase to speak glyphs into the land) reframes the goal without on-page cost or foreclosed options; the ruby flake "dissolves" conveniently, and Elara walks back "no longer a solitary seeker" with no visible price paid. The closure unit reads as thematic assertion ("restoration, not rule") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—Elara teaching breath through the scar-link and choosing not to open the door—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), reweighting the sanctuary from prison to classroom with cost (she remains isolated but now connected). However, the "fading threshold" pressure and the foreign presence feel abstract and under-dramatized; the threat never crystallizes into a concrete antagonist or stakes test, weakening the tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues symbolic pressure (bolt, glitchy texts, Heartroot contact) toward a final transmutation image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (Elara, mushroom farm, Convergence announcement). Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt transforms into a seed-diamond, then is buried—a resonant reconfiguration of her survivor identity into "architect of light." Cost is visible (the bolt is gone, its ghost-weight lifted) and the final image reweights prior material. However, the causal chain is thin: the Convergence "begins" and Elara presses the bolt with no dramatized resistance, complication, or micro-failure that she must navigate. The resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency against friction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout. The standing-wave visualization functions as a taught pattern that delivers the hidden panel, and the letter provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief from generational burden) with felt emotional cost. However, the cost is primarily relief rather than foreclosure—Elara gains rather than loses, and the "legacy is release" message risks feeling convenient. The causality is clean: memory → visualization → dust pattern → hidden letter, but the final turn lacks a trade-off or renunciation that would elevate closure to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story offers a hybrid lens—part accumulative texture, part causal quest—but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Kael simply performs the ritual, light blooms, and he's "transformed" without forfeiting anything on the page or facing a consequential trade-off. The orientation is delayed (who/where/when clarified only after the opening paragraph's sensory catalog), applying a −0.3 penalty. The marionette dance and unsnapping are presented as steps in a predetermined pattern rather than a choice that narrows options or changes knowledge. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the piece reads as a procession to an inevitable, costless payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, file room, post-emancipation). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery accumulates meaning through the button, note, and dust pattern. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara's understanding of her work and self reweights—but cost is asserted rather than dramatized. The final image ("page waiting for gentle hands") reconfigures her loneliness into purpose, yet no path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks felt consequence beyond thematic restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (archival truth reappearing through light and water). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara stands firm, truth broadcast, enforcers arriving—options crystallized, cost felt in her refusal to flee. However, the cost remains asserted ("unshakable peace") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or bodily consequence, and the because/therefore links in the middle third (hoofprint → willow alignment → ironwood grove) feel mechanically sequential rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments of lullaby, pauses between notes, and dewdrop formation build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (vested hush wrapping the grotto, prophecy dissolved). Orientation anchors who (Elias, morning fog saxophonist), where (cabin, valley, radiant grotto), and when (before dawn, as dewdrops form) within the opening lines. The closure—absolute silence, unified light, prophecy hushed—lands on the page with felt cost (tears, reverent care packing the instrument) and a final rainbow image that reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening (the shift from whisper fragments to absolute silence that neutralizes the prophecy) satisfies the 600–800 word requirement under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    The orientation test passes (who/where/when anchor by ~120 words), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs. Elara begins sorting seeds and building monuments, finds a special leaf, places it in a monument, receives a vision, and resumes—no option is foreclosed, no path closed, no tactical shift forced. The "cascade of emotion" and "warm certainty" are asserted epiphanies without on-page price. The piece reads as a single elaborated ritual with no meaningful tightening or deepening under any lens; accumulative design requires pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake, but the final paragraph simply restarts the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the manor arrival; the locket→greenhouse→latch→cavern sequence links causally under a situational lens that crystallizes stance. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's realization that "direction was not a fixed point to be demanded, but a current to be felt" reweights her relationship to control, and the needle's refusal to point north charges the final image with conceptual cost. However, "the precise timeframe when coincidence becomes pattern" is told rather than demonstrated through dramatized causality, weakening the felt necessity of the discovery. Cost is visible in the surrender of her "rigid need for control," though the language risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and sustains a single continuous scene in one location. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the crucible mended, guilt transmuted into "sacred anchor"), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible: Elara performs the ritual without forfeiting a live option or enduring visible friction. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (alchemical ritual building to symbolic transformation), yet the final image restates the thematic claim ("redemption blooms...in honest repair") without reweighting prior material through a new physical or relational fact. The result is a thematic echo rather than a closure that reconfigures stakes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. The piece accumulates pressure through distorted harp notes → spectral confession → laughter integration, culminating in Cora's dissolution—a Resonant Reconfiguration (spectral release) with visible cost (her form dissolves, Elara feels the weight). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from sorrow-anchoring to laughter-weaving, altering Cora's state. The closure lands on the page with felt cost, though the cost is more emotional release than a path foreclosed for Elara herself, keeping this shy of high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line three. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern recurrence build toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Kael loops the strap as a compass and walks forward—reconfigures symbol but not options or knowledge with legible cost; the "first genuine smile in years" declares change rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence in the final beat shows a visible or felt price paid. Escalation reads as intensifying figurative language ("tears streamed, not of sorrow, but revelation") rather than a tightening of choices or deepening of stakes under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern early (market, fragment, three paintings) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the fragment is placed in the frame—a ritual act that reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The escalation reads as density increase across the three canvases, each hidden detail tightening the link between past and present, culminating in the shard's placement. Cost is conceptual and felt (permanent anchor for future seekers, transformation of the city's silent narratives), though the price to Elara personally remains oblique. One micro turn (fragment warms, shifts from glass to key) supports the final move without fragmenting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Leo's observational method leads to discovery, which triggers the ghost's manifestation and the recovery of the mainspring barrels. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Elias's dissolution and Leo's vow—lands on the page with emotional cost (seventy years of burden lifted, a new sacred duty assumed). However, the escalation is minimal; once Leo finds the cache, the resolution unfolds without meaningful resistance or complication, softening the tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through image and description toward the rupture, then offers a Resonant Reconfiguration when the library transforms from static to dynamic. The cost is conceptual (destabilization of perfect order) but felt only abstractly; no concrete forfeiture or altered tactic appears on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Closure lands under the accumulative lens, but the cost proof test is marginal: "destabilization had not destroyed but evolved" tells the shift rather than showing a legible price in Elara's final stance or a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure—revealing the Aethel ritual via projection—lands on the page, but the cost is abstract (vindication "too late for its prophet") rather than a choice that forecloses Elara's options. The drive lens appears causal but the key reversal (shard glowing, truth revealed) occurs through passive observation during the storm rather than protagonist agency. Valerius's immediate capitulation dissolves decades of dispute without friction, undercutting the stakes declared in the setup. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when by line 2), but the resolution feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: by ~120 words we have only "beneath the sleeping city" and "the resonance chamber"—no anchored who/where/when until Kael is named at line three, and "thirty nights" of backstory precedes any present action. The closure—light returns along the tether—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is opaque: the philosopher's stone chip "glowed with verdigris luminescence" and the tether "held," yet we never see what specific choice or renunciation Kael made that changed the outcome versus what would have happened if he'd simply turned the key without the wilt or the song. The escalation is told ("the wilt seized him") rather than dramatized through a narrowing of options. Apply Orientation penalty −0.4 and lens ambiguity −0.3; the piece hovers between Accumulative (song-as-texture) and Causal (tether-as-mechanism) without committing, and closure cost is asserted ("restored cycle") not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara renounces extraction, aligns the compass as tribute, and internalizes the lagoon's "quiet wisdom," foreclosing her prior mode of collection with felt cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered description, the psychometry block reweights the compass, and the final gestures (returning the compass, refusing the sample) constitute a cadence shift that honors the threshold. One persistent constraint—the lagoon's resistance to measurement—shapes the final image. Causality is clean within this lens; no major breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers memory, storm, carving, and ancestral voice to deepen reverie. Orientation is anchored early (archway, storm, GPS failure). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara steps from the archway with the carved talisman, confident and connected. The felt cost is oblique—isolation transformed into communion—but the final image of her walking "footsteps confident on the path home" reweights prior material. However, the tightening is gentle rather than decisive; the storm's relenting and the emerging seabird feel more like mood shifts than irreversible turns. One meaningful deepening is present, but cost legibility at closure is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and thematic weight toward a final resonant reconfiguration where night-blooming flowers are reframed as acts of courage rather than hiding. Orientation anchors clearly by the first 120 words. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains insight without forfeiting anything on the page; tears and gratitude do not constitute a foreclosed path or altered tactic. The revelation feels granted rather than earned through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who, where, and when early (zeppelin library, Elias, post-discovery). The retrocognitive vision provides a clear tightening—Elias corrects Anya's directional error—but the closure unit lacks visible cost on the page; Elias returns to his chair with "profound relief" and begins writing, a fulfillment rather than a foreclosure. The official record is revealed as a lie, yet no on-page decision alters Elias's options or forecloses a path. The lens reads Causal through the vision sequence, but the ending delivers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost, landing as resolution rather than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the ten-year gap and silence frame the situation clearly. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory threads and conceptual layering build toward the blueprint and burial. However, the closure unit is a planted seed and symbolic vow—Charged Poise is claimed, but no on-page cost is legible; the story tells us the foundation is laid "within her" without a felt price or foreclosed path. The ending image of future lanterns and breathing Cove is declared rather than dramatized, diluting the closure effect under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (venerable scribe, orchard garden, post-foghorn silence). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: memory deepens into prophecy recognition, density increases through layered sensory detail and the wax shaving's hum, culminating in the silent apple-fall and stance shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization from archiving to cultivation) with conceptual cost legible in "archiving was complete. Cultivation had begun." One tightening occurs when the childhood memory syncs with the artifact's hum, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is felt but oblique—she forecloses the archivist identity without visible loss on the page, which prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual accumulates detail and the vortex's opening reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the vortex stabilizes, Elara gathers the seeds, and the ending image crystallizes spring as "texture in her hands, a legacy to plant." However, cost at closure is asserted ("covenant," "promise") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or tactical consequence. The piece accumulates density but the final image's cost remains conceptual and oblique, not undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elara's refusal to ring the bell forecloses ritual adherence with felt cost (the Abbot's initial "stern worry," her own "release of decades of expectation"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—decades of data reweight prophecy—held consistently to the ending. Orientation is prompt (Mount Aethel, dawn ritual, solstice context by line 4). One meaningful deepening: the zero-hour alignment crystallizes her choice with visible restraint. The piece teaches its reflective mode early and uses it to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the meteor event and the reflection deepens at the lantern glass. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elian's acceptance of his role carries conceptual cost (the overlooked era reframed as preparation), though the price remains implied rather than dramatically foregrounded. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor triggers empathy and crystallizes his understanding, satisfying the lens, but the cost is felt more than visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors immediately (oasis, recluse, visible ghosts). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the daily ritual of opening the box accumulates meaning until Elias's gaze shifts to the recluse, prompting the realization that completes the covenant. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost dissolves with gratitude, the box shifts from ghost-binding to remembrance vessel). Cost is conceptual—the recluse's solitude transforms into purposeful witness—but the final image carries undeniable weight. One concern: the midpoint somewhat dilutes pressure with extended reflection on the journal and Anya's backstory rather than advancing present action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). Orientation anchors are present early (emerald silo, Kael, time capsule). Closure lands on-page with Elara's realization and Kael's dissolution, reweighting the "texture of time" premise with conceptual cost (his borrowed hours spent, legacy passed). One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment triggers timelessness, then the final handoff crystallizes purpose. Cost is legible in Kael's dissolution and Elara's inheritance of responsibility. Minor slip: the "months" of prior garage-sale work is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the causal chain slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early enough (poet at lagoon cove, post-rain twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the kite's fall seeds the feather discovery, which charges the writing act. However, the closure—Elara writing and leaving the kite for the tide—lacks a legible cost or a before/after shift in her options or stance; she intended to write "Woven Dawns" and does so, with the feather as a convenient new quill rather than a constraint that narrows or reweights her method. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (anchors arrive promptly), but Cost proof test fails: no exact line shows a foreclosed path or felt price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/fulfillment hybrid): Kael completes the network and his breath "folded into the orchard's breath," foreclosing his own continuation with visible cost (his death) and conceptual gain (covenant renewed). Orientation anchors early (island caretaker, orchard, six months). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: systematic wrapping beats and diary entries build density until the final chime and warmth radiate through the network, reweighting the dominant stake (restoration) through cadence shift and pattern completion. One minor causality question: how the "click" confirms connection is asserted but not grounded in prior mechanical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when clearly and follows a coherent causal chain: Aris seeks the path, follows footprints, finds the chamber, converges with Elias. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding homecoming as molecular memory rather than cosmic sentiment), but the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than felt on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of molecular imagery converging at the basin), yet the dusty footprints function as convenient breadcrumbs with no clear author or constraint, weakening causal pressure. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, with lyric resonance building toward a final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—a faint green thread pushing through wood and Kael's certainty that concord can bloom again—qualifies as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, reweighting the dominant stake (peace as dormant seed) with undeniable conceptual cost. However, the cost itself is more asserted ("carrying the unshakable certainty") than made viscerally felt or concretely forfeited on the page. The escalation from planting to nightingale's song to green shoot follows a lyric cadence but lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening turn that narrows Kael's options or changes his knowledge; the beats accumulate more than they complicate. The Orientation Test is satisfied and the lens holds, but the closure image, while resonant, does not charge prior material with a sharp enough reconfiguration or demonstrate the visible price paid to enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches a situational lens early (riddle pressure) and delivers closure through Charged Poise: Kael walks toward reunion with the cost felt in "one deliberate step at a time." Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph. The causal chain from riddle to leaf-as-lens to decoded message to departure is motivated, though the middle beat (trying water, smoke, light) adds texture without escalating pressure. Cost is conceptual—leaving Rusthaven, abandoning retirement—but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (echoed silence, compass rose, distorted starlight) toward a conceptual repricing where ritual becomes scientific expedition. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The closure—Elara's realization that her grandfather left breadcrumbs and that her role is "keeper of the lens"—lands on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than felt. The threshold moment (glimpsing the Lyre) is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (swap pieces → sky heals incrementally) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change (the sky shatters and reforms, the sundial lid glows). Orientation anchors arrive by ~130 words (who, where, when), satisfying the test. However, the closure unit itself—golden light, reformed sky, aligned constellations—lands with declarative certainty but minimal felt cost; Kael's tears and warmth read as reward rather than price. The accumulative escalation (pawn → knight → bishop → queen → king) is legible, but each beat feels additive rather than tightening options or imposing trade-offs. The causal chain is clean within its fairy-tale logic, yet the ending offers relief without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path, weakening the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (the whispering gallery transforms from repository of trapped pain to vessel of living purpose). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening lines. However, the escalation is purely additive—each spelled word summons another echo without tightening options or raising cost. The final placement of the chessboard and the swirl of whispers reconfigure meaning, but no on-page choice or forfeiture is legible; the transformation feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual, discovery, texture-seeding, and finally a passage opening. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara steps toward the passage with reclaimed strength—and the stone's message reweights the ten-year avoidance with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening (seeding the memory) tightens her stance. The cost is felt but slightly abstract; the walk "toward a state of being" softens the physical stakes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, frozen village by ~50 words). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through chess metaphor, thread-decoding, and guilt layering until the labyrinth opens and sound returns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the village awakens; Kael achieves "fierce repose" and ends his self-exile). Cost is present but somewhat abstract—he faced his blunder and "chose forgiveness," yet the on-page price during the decoding feels more intellectual than visceral. The causal spine (decode tapestry → align rings → break stasis) is clean, and the midpoint turn (recognizing the defensive sequence he failed to teach) tightens focus, meeting the one-deepening requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered poetic refractions that reweight blame into shared responsibility. Orientation anchors early (canyon, pale spire, pre-ritual timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ritual transforms from monolithic blame to polyphonic witness—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt; no on-page forfeiture or visible sacrifice accompanies the shift, and Borin's reversal lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat. The drive lens reads accumulative-textural: density builds through paired fracture-memory stitches until the final golden ignition. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the mended sparrow's glow and calmed sea reconfigure oblivion's edge into "a threshold illuminated by golden seams." Cost is conceptual and felt (acceptance of dissolution, transformation of grief) rather than a decisive action, but the image lands with undeniable pressure and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias releases the shell as an offering, relinquishing possession with visible cost (leaving behind the physical anchor of memory). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—grief imagery, mirror fragments, the painted shell accumulate pressure until the cave's stillness reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (nostalgic quay painter, coastal setting, post-mirror-crack timeframe) arrive within the first ~100 words. The "wrong turn" mechanism lands late (paragraph 7) but the causality holds: sorrow-driven misstep → cave discovery → release, a single meaningful tightening that forecloses clinging to grief.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and charged imagery build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas's testimony validates the "whisper" premise and Elias feels his intent received. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraphs. The closure carries conceptual cost—Elias's vulnerability in releasing the vial and Silas's humbled admission—but the reconfiguration hinges on Silas's off-stage experience rather than on-page dramatized pressure, slightly softening the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (memory-building ritual, moon-phase modulation) and maintains it through closure. The final circuit completion triggers a vision sequence that reweights prior material, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the phone-call mechanism arrives unmotivated (no hint of why a rotary phone exists in a signal station or who calls), and the cost at closure is asserted ("peace settled") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a lyric design: the orchard, relic, and truffle accumulate symbolic weight toward a Charged Poise ending. However, the closure unit remains entirely prospective ("she would attempt," "envisioned the cabin"), never landing an on-page moment where cost is legible. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The causality is stable but the final image substitutes declaration for dramatized pressure, weakening the closure effect required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the layering of observed absences (the flower's alpine origin, rope-burned hands, the dried state) until the final act of pressing the Edelweiss into the log reconfigures the opening solitude into witnessed kinship. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Silas's vigil continues, but the tapestry of borrowed memories now includes J's gesture, and the chasm between isolation and connection is "gently closed by witness." Cost is felt—Silas accepts the burden of these stories as his duty—but the cost remains oblique and largely thematic rather than a sharp forfeiture of options. The narrative coheres under the chosen lens, though the tightening is gradual rather than knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric overtones. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The quest structure follows a motivated chain: chip glimmers → micro-coordinates → hike → cavern → ants guide → doorway. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias places the chip, light blooms, he understands the doorway is a moment of clarity rather than a portal, and the promise is fulfilled. Cost is conceptual—decades of loneliness replaced by connection—but the final image ("the decision itself was the threshold") borders on abstraction and the emotional price feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning (bleeding starlight, fireflies, embers). Orientation is prompt: queen, ridge, midnight warning. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra returns "star-forged" with resolve to mend light. Cost is implied—her withdrawal caused the bleed—but the final image leans heavily on assertion ("starlight in her veins") rather than a concrete action or renunciation that makes the price undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the tapestry vision), satisfying minimal escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: metaphoric density increases, pigments layer, and the final image reweights "worth" via the couple's softened posture and ember-glow. Closure form is Conceptual Repricing—"true value lies not in possession, but in the courage to be seen"—but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than legible in action. The piece opens with adequate spatial anchors (warm stone, twilight, ember nexus) but the causal link between Elara's brush strokes and the couple's emotional shift is implied by metaphor rather than earned on the page. The sequence reads as observation plus thematic overlay, not because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (jaded wonder settling as acceptance) with conceptual cost—Elias acknowledges he remains "chronologically confused" but no longer terrorized. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: feral nostalgia deepens through the dream sequence, manifesting as jealousy, then softening via the past self's wave and the scroll's message. One meaningful tightening occurs when the young Elias waves, reweighting the jealousy into connection. Cost is legible but oblique; the final peace is "fragile, resilient," not a decisive external change.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the clamp's history, and Elara's ritual intention, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the repaired clamp and Mrs. Gable's tears reweight Elara's sense of purpose). The closure lands with felt cost—Elara's rediscovered meaning after loss—and the water-clock motif charges the final image. One persistent slip: the midpoint drifts into reflection without a sharp present-tense choice to anchor the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the scars transform into luminous narrative) as closure. The cost is legible—she surrenders to vulnerability and old pain—and the "held breath timeframe" tightens pressure throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink crystallizes, forcing her method shift. Minor orientation debt: the floating platform's spatial relationship to the world below and the tea ceremony's imminent arrival are sketched but not anchored enough to fully ground the reader by the 120-word mark, though the pattern pays off adequately at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elara's guilt drives her to enact the ritual (perfume + music), which facilitates Valerius's peace and her own forgiveness. Orientation anchors solidify by the second paragraph (archive, dawn, orchard's fate). The closure unit—Valerius's dissolution into peace paired with Elara's quiet certainty—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for both), with felt cost visible in "the orchard would become memory, logged and gone" and the "gritty alchemy" of forgiveness. One minor causality seam: the mechanics of "induced currents of resonant memory" arrive abruptly without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear who/where/when anchors early and follows an Accumulative lens: spiral arbitration builds density through repeated word-stabilization beats, culminating in "I am" that reweights existence itself with conceptual cost (the void on "existence" closed by assertion). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure. One concern: the dictionary's sudden eruption of "silent light" feels convenient, arriving without prior signal that the book could channel physical force.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the countdown ritual builds density through sensory and perceptual shifts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the shepherd achieves understanding and releases his need to count backwards. Orientation anchors quickly (shepherd, platform, fjord, post-observation). The cost is visible—he "no longer needed to count backwards"—a path foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs through the countdown sequence, which reweights his decades-long obsession into acceptance. The closure lands cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear hybrid lens (lyric-accumulative with mild causal threading) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara finds the final scrawl and her perspective shifts from academic detachment to heartfelt synthesis. However, the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical sacrifice dramatized. The subway door reveal relies on coincidental timing (she happens to have the exact lantern, the exact bench is accessible, the final scrawl appears fresh beside a coffee stain with no plausible causal setup). Orientation is clean, but the closure beat tells us she has arrived rather than showing a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds pattern (loop, disc rotation, circular sorrow) early and the final image reweights the disc from relic to compass, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is felt—the caller's eighteen-month loop ends with a decisive choice to dial anew—but Elara herself pays no visible price; her "cultivated estrangement" softens descriptively ("less like a fortress, more like a harbor") without on-page forfeiture. Closure lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening, satisfying the 600–800 word gate, but the lack of protagonist cost in the closure beat prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors quickly (archivist, jetty, twilight, grief ritual) and accumulates pressure through layered sensory detail and ritual precision. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant regenerated, weight shifted) with conceptual cost legible in the renunciation of sorrow's weight. However, the causal linkage between the ritual acts and the internal shift remains thin—wind, water, and will are invoked but the mechanism by which writing changes her remains asserted rather than dramatized. One meaningful deepening is present but the felt cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph; the station is established, Elara named, and twilight signaled early. The story follows a single-POV, two-beat structure (waiting → encounter) that fits scope defaults. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's stance crystallizes: she will "cultivate connection" rather than seek a cure) with felt cost (she gives away her anchor object and commits to permanence at the station). The cost is present but borders on abstract—"hollow loneliness was gone, replaced by resonant warmth" tells more than it shows. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through layered backstory, the rumor-chain motif, and the ivy/station imagery, then shifts cadence at the encounter. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman arrives and Elara's clarity crystallizes, but the turn feels declared rather than earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragments of the musical trail converge into a chord of peace, reweighting grief through density and cadence. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when by line 1); two shards (journey in, stillpoint revelation) with a clean transition at "Suddenly, all vibration dissolved." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that love transforms but persists), though cost remains implied rather than sharply legible—no visible forfeiture or renunciation that forecloses a living option. The lens holds, but the final image lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price that would lift this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pen's unbending physically enacts Elara's cognitive shift from rigid blame to flexible acceptance, and the decision to return carrying "threshed meaning" forecloses the refuge-of-despair path with visible cost (she must re-enter the community that trusted her). The causal chain from signal misread → pen slam → unbending → new interpretive stance holds under a Hybrid lens. One deduction: the "gravitational waves carried these edits" beat introduces a late mechanism (luminous glyphs as cosmic record) that feels ornamental rather than consequence-bearing—it doesn't alter Elara's options or the community's fate, weakening the cost proof slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (harbor, moonlight, Elias) within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through layered reflection and the Lily encounter reweights isolation into connection. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of "carrying a silent symphony" crystallizes the shift from solitary exile to shared ritual. Cost is felt but oblique; no concrete path is visibly foreclosed on the page, weakening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael traces a deliberate trail of artifacts that build toward the vandalized portrait encoding the Canticle. The closure—discovering the melody in the scars and retrieving the song—lands on the page with visible cost (his tears, his vow of atonement). However, the cost feels more emotional summary than a foreclosed path; he departs with "the light melody of a rescued promise" rather than a price that constrains future action. The escalation is a steady deepening rather than a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the accumulative lens is taught early and holds through the lyric closure. The drumming sequence builds density and the shared dream's momentary manifestation registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "three heartbeats" of presence, then dissolution). Cost is felt in the auroral sorrow and the ephemerality, though the final image ("a seed of memory, planted deep") pivots toward future promise rather than deepening present loss, slightly softening the undeniable pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a stated goal (prove whispers work) leading to a demonstration. Orientation anchors arrive early (port, storm, containers). The closure—Vale's dawning respect and Kael's quiet affirmation—lands on the page but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The "challenge" inciting incident occurs off-page ("that very afternoon"), weakening causal linkage. The whispering-gallery reveal functions as information rather than a turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Kael, dock, evening). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the mirror-then-shutters sequence, and the final image reweights Elara's isolation via the starlight pattern. Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (the secret dissolves, her gaze shifts skyward), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—no forfeited path, no visible price paid. One meaningful deepening is present (shutters framing Orion), sufficient for this length, yet the "choked sob...not of sorrow, but release" tells the transformation rather than showing a tactical or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the rebellion accumulates through synchronized displays, mist-wrapped atmosphere, and the final dawn image. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the town "transformed in spirit"), but the cost remains abstract—no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the "rebellion" succeeds without visible friction or sacrifice. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The lens holds, but the closure image asserts transformation rather than demonstrating a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—arrival at the island and self-recognition at the spring—lands on the page but the cost reads conceptual and abstract ("detach from armor," "unclasped memory") rather than felt. The piece teaches a Resonant Reconfiguration lens by midpoint, but the scrimshaw's mechanics ("not force, but invitation") arrive late and the island's materialization feels coincidental rather than causally linked to prior choices. The orientation is clear early, but the mid-section's heavy backstory ("the captain's roar, metallic taste of fear") compresses present action into summary, weakening the because/therefore chain from sea-bottom to island-shore.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Elias moves from performance-for-others to sustainable lightness within grief, anchored by the sparrow nested in flowers and the turbine shadow cycle. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ritual repetition deepens until the final cadence shift reweights the hum from enforcement symbol to sanctuary. Cost is visible: he relinquishes the mask, accepts the ambiguity, and allows vulnerability ("did not wipe it away"). One tightening occurs when the carved bird completes and integrates with the bouquet, crystallizing the remade hush.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the opening, with the poet's name, physical details, and the ban's nature remaining vague past the 120-word threshold. The closure—dissolving the boundary through paraphrase—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted ("scar was healed," "purpose fulfilled") rather than felt as a foreclosed path or trade-off. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of paraphrase deepens the hum), but the final reconfiguration lacks visible price; the poet simply steps forward into unity with no friction or loss dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern, reprise, and reweighting through the exchange of perspectives. Orientation anchors (who/where/when: Elara in the glassblower's courtyard post-phoenix) land by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—both characters gain new sensory/perceptual palettes through the barter, with visible cost (Elara's previous inability, Kael's prior shame). The because/therefore chain is clean: Elara's arrangement → Kael's curiosity → exchange → dual awakenings. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reed tongue's note becomes "a golden texture, a vibration painting light" for Elara, reweighting her experience. The final paragraphs extend the reconfiguration with forward-looking closure rather than a single decisive image, which slightly diffuses impact but remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and image density build toward a conceptual repricing where "gardeners" replaces "archaeologists." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lab, afternoon, Elara at threshold). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the laboratory transforms from museum to "cradle of living dialogue"—but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page action is foreclosed, no character pays a visible price. The Resonator "hums" and technicians "approach...with open palms" without dramatized resistance or trade-off, deflating the stakes at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal chain: grief → ritual → discovery → renewal, and the closure lands on-page with Elara's return to her workshop and first sketch. However, the discovery of the grove is a gift waiting for her rather than a turn earned by her agency; Lena's posthumous masterpiece resolves the problem without Elara facing a costly choice in the present. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (grief softening, purpose clarified), but the cost feels retrospective rather than paid in the observatory scene. Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; the origami method and repeated motifs accumulate, but the final image relies on Lena's legacy more than Elara's present sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear orientation (who/where/when by the second paragraph) and establishes an Accumulative lens through cartographic pattern-building. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Leo's shift and Elara's renewed work, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The knock/arrival/departure structure provides one mild deepening when Elara confides her methodology, yet the final image of "patient, measured...witnessing" recapitulates the opening stance without undeniable pressure or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (who, where, stakes), and the piece holds a clear Accumulative lens: density increases through the constellation of memory-atoms, then breaks pattern when Elara confronts the council-chamber core and purifies it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—she steps back with "purified knowledge a steady weight," the pagoda calm, her role redefined—and the cost is conceptual (loss of innocence, burden of difficult truths). One deduction: the council-chamber atom arrives late and resolves the entire purification sequence in a single beat without prior complication, which softens escalation under the chosen lens. The final image reweights the archive and her mission, but the path from ritual start to finish feels too linear for the "steadily unpredictable" framing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's archive review deepens understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (her acceptance of evolution as preservation). Closure lands on the page with felt cost—she surrenders her belief in stasis and the stone metamorphoses, reweighting her role. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The weak point: the shadow's seven-dusk observation occurs off-page, and the climactic discovery unfolds through summary ("Over silent decades of footage, she witnessed...") rather than dramatized beats, blunting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and holds a single POV across one night in the workshop. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of reflection and symbolic reweighting rather than because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara places the tail tip in a box, reframes her stance, and steps into dawn with "balance" as the final image. However, the cost remains abstract; we do not see a specific choice or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page, only a claim that her trust "would regenerate…not as blind faith, but a conscious practice rooted in strength." The felt price is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers plant-transmitted memories and symbolic objects (hourglass, coffee ring, scars) toward a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 25 (tower, dawn, post-surgery). The closure reweights "scars as tunnels" and "displaced miracles," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—Elara's renunciation of wound-probing is declared in summary ("She would no longer seek closure by opening wounds") without an on-page forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. The resonant reconfiguration relies on thematic echo more than felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory density and thematic weight toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is immediate (booth, film strip, psychometry quest). The ending reweights "unused love" from a location to a universal truth about release, with the conceptual cost legible in Clara's sacrifice and Elara's acceptance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vision crystallizes the answer, satisfying the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory accumulation and lyric repetition by the first third. Orientation is anchored early (archway, aurora, astrolabe). However, closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is asserted rather than demonstrated with on-page cost: Elara "surrenders" and feels creativity "uncoil," but no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, and no tactic altered. The final walk toward village lights and promise of future charcoal work describes a change in emotional state without dramatizing the decisive alteration or renunciation that would earn the shift. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence break or charged image should reweight the stake with cost; here the ending diffuses into multiple restatements of the same epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the post-forest wasteland timeframe is clear. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repetition, lyric cadence, and the accretion of spark-cultivation beats. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the chess clock shifts from tombstone to seed; the guard becomes cultivator), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"his emptied mind" and "dreamlessness" are labels without a visible forfeiture or friction that narrows options on the page. One meaningful deepening (the "occasionally everywhere" glimpse at line 222) reweights the mission, but the final image relies on thematic echo rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough to avoid orientation penalty. However, closure lacks felt cost: the gear clicks in, systems activate, and Kael experiences expansion "not as chaos, but as boundless, organized potential" without on-page sacrifice or foreclosed option. The ending offers thematic recapitulation ("wild frontier…was not to be tamed, but tended") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior stakes. Under a causal lens, the protagonist's choice to insert the gear is uncontested—no reversal, no visible price—yielding summary satisfaction rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no purposeful disorientation pattern; who, where, and when remain vague through the opening third (−0.4). No meaningful causal linkage: the guides appear, walk, dispense wisdom, then vanish without Elara making a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The "closure" is a told realization ("the courage you sought was never out there") without visible cost or a decision that changes her situation. The ticket-punch mechanic functions as symbolic décor rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's decision to leave the door open, mount the bolt, and shift her silence from guilt to remembrance reconfigures her relationship to the fortress with visible cost (accepting ongoing pain as compass). Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through the discovery sequence, and the final placing of the bolt creates a cadence shift that reweights safety versus silence. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the discolored stone and commits to investigation despite risk, narrowing her options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who, where, and when emerge slowly through elevated description. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure is a passive dissolution rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost; Kael's fulfillment is told, and the library fades without an on-page action that narrows options or reweights prior material. The historian's courtroom scene occurs off-stage in summary, undercutting causal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal turn (the AI prompt). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara's shift from mourning to cartography, "moored to purpose"—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no tactical choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, only a tonal reconfiguration. The delayed-revelation mechanism (tapping unlocks a forgotten video) introduces a rule late without prior setup, weakening causality. The ending reweights grief into hope, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the conceptual price ("some paths vanish") is told rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift: barefoot Kael, abandoned spaceport, violet-gold daylight, stone circle at bay's heart. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (rusted carts, faded slogans, moss-clad stones) and the hum functions as a cadence break that reweights despair into "thunderous serenity." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael internalizes the hum and commits to carry serenity back to hidden cells. Cost is conceptual—he forgoes vengeance for a quieter method—but the final image makes the shift undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (hot springs, reconstruction, Elara). The causal lens holds: kite → glyphs → amber → unseal → fern emerges. Closure is a Decisive Change (the fern flourishes, terraces gain roots) with conceptual cost legible in Elara's realization that tradition was fulfilled through action. One deduction: the pine's telepathic instruction ("Decode the script. It is a key.") supplies convenient guidance that narrows Elara's agency at the inciting moment. The cost at closure is more thematic vindication than visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara carries her pearl forward, grief integrated. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through repeated somatic anchors and image reprises (photograph, lighthouse, pearl)—but the ending reconfigures nothing; it confirms what the opening already established. Cost is asserted ("realistic weight," "mosaic of loss and love") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change: Kael untangles threads, the web stabilizes, walls firm, and he gains purpose to paint again—visible before/after with felt cost (acknowledging shame, embracing necessary darkness). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone: fractured reality → descent → redesign → restoration. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse library, twilight). One meaningful tightening occurs when walls press and threads pull him down. Minor cost-proof concern: the "luminescent ache of purpose" at closure feels asserted more than shown, but the physical restoration (walls firm, box whole) makes the change legible enough.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael's decision not to rebuild the drone forecloses a path with visible cost, and his understanding reweights the temporal mystery with conceptual clarity. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—patterns (wind, ink, eclipse-dust) accumulate toward a cadence shift at the vanishing. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the spilled ink mirrors the eclipse patterns, narrowing Kael's focus and crystallizing the final realization, though the cost of losing the drone forever could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Situational (pressure crystallizes stance under the constraint of discovery). Closure is Charged Poise—Elara transmits, lies to Kael, and the final image reconfigures her role from passive keeper to active catalyst with conceptual cost ("no longer merely a keeper of frozen pasts"). Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, cryogenic library, solstice watch). The cost is conceptual and relational (lying to Kael, weaponizing truth) rather than physically dramatized, and the reversal (Kael's footsteps) arrives conveniently to force the act rather than through prior causality. One meaningful tightening present; closure lands under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns rising meditative density through recurrent motifs (knife/sheathe, sandbag scrap, engraved quiet, tranquil blaze) and converges on a final image of continuity weaving. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final touch and tomorrow's vow crystallize her stance with felt resolve, though the cost remains oblique—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, only her father's legacy symbolically buried again. Orientation is clean by ~46 words. The accumulative pattern holds, but the ending reweights existing material more than it narrows options or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the piece holds a single POV across one continuous scene. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the garden's chaos accumulates through vivid imagery and Elara's voiced silence deepens in the vortex, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (she does not capture the echo but is remade by it—Charged Poise with felt cost). The cost is legible: she abandons her original goal of capture and accepts transformation, though the exact sentence marking that shift could be sharper. Minor deduction: the transition from zigzag avoidance to "straight and sure" closure reads slightly asserted rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients quickly (observatory, phone call, heiress identity) and the drive lens reads as Causal with proof-by-contradiction structuring the investigation. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara will publish the truth, transforming private discovery into public accountability. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than dramatized—no on-page resistance, no visible price for exposing family shame, no moment where publication itself becomes a difficult choice. The logical proof unfolds cleanly but the emotional/social consequence of "intervening" remains abstract, weakening the felt weight of the ending decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (guilt softened into guiding star). Cost is implied through the amber cooling and the phrase "hard-won understanding," but the exact price paid on the page remains oblique—no concrete forfeiture or altered option is visible. The Orientation Test is waived; who/where/when are anchored early through vivid detail. Causality is present but soft: the letters prescribe the solution, and Elara executes without meaningful friction or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the mandala's construction, whispers soften toward the emergent hush, and the anxious "What remains?" thread provides a micro-turn before the integrative closure word. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is visible—Elara's spoken "Integrate" deepens the hush and reweights the stake with felt cost (the mandala will blur, but understanding persists). One meaningful tightening occurs when the new anxious whisper threatens fragile peace, forcing Elara's interjection. Cost is legible in the impermanence lesson and the transformation of her internal state, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and cleanly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: ash, tessera, chipped mosaic, and steel framework recur with mounting symbolic weight, culminating in the renaming and embedding of the tessera. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image (sunlight on tessera, children's laughter) reweights "Ashen Square" into "Sanctuary of Echoes" and the plaza's meaning shifts from tomb to teacher. However, the cost remains asserted ("retrocognitive trap shattered") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page, which keeps this out of high bands despite coherent lens adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elara is, where she stands, and what specific barrier she faces emerge slowly through atmospheric description rather than anchored early. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (echoes gathering into a bridge), but causality is weak: Elara hums, draws strands, braids them, and Julian coalesces without obstacle or reversal. The "fractured timeline" functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that narrows options. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she dissolves after fulfilling purpose), but the cost is asserted ("her form growing lighter, her purpose fulfilled") rather than shown as a forfeiture that alters present stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; the orchard "responds" to her will without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory cues and the geode's return to build toward a final image reconfiguration. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the willow photograph reweights Elara's understanding of her method—with conceptual cost (filing the recall notice, keeping the geode). However, orientation debt persists: the telepathy pill trial, recall notice, and static shock backstory arrive as told exposition rather than anchored present stimuli, muddying the causal line between pill/shock/geode until late. The "static shock as catalyst" explanation reads as retroactive patch rather than dramatized discovery, weakening the because/therefore linkage even under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's sensory mapping work builds through heat-mapping, fossil encounter, map completion, and placement. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Elara returning to the depths with the fossil's pulse as "compass and confirmation" reweights her solitary witness role. However, the cost at closure is implied rather than viscerally legible on the page—no specific renunciation, loss, or altered tactic appears in the final beat, only mood ("hope, heat-mapped and true").

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative lens: button fragments accrue meaning until the final mosaic reweights the prophecy. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—black sand shifts from countdown to "measure of communal attention"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no prior path is visibly foreclosed on the page, only a future action (carrying mosaic to village) is promised. The crack spiderwebbing the ceiling introduces physical urgency but does not tighten tactics or narrow options before the insight lands, weakening the felt price of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elias, Zephyr Bluff, spring's tilt) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the pillbox exchange and melting code. However, the closure unit—Anya taking the box, the shared understanding—lands as mutual acknowledgment without a visible choice or foreclosed path that makes a before/after legible with felt cost. The snow-code fades, the mist lifts, "broken things began, softly, to mend," but no on-page decision or renunciation reweights Elias's options; the ending gestures toward healing without demonstrating what he or Anya sacrifices to stand together. The drive lens reads Accumulative (mist, codes, pillbox motifs recur) yet the final cadence shift remains atmospheric rather than a pressure point that charges the image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is accumulative/textural: the vigil gathers layers of memory until the rain stops, signaling resolution. Orientation anchors quickly (coachman, fog-bound crossing, waiting). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Silas distills the promise's essence and renews his vow with visible cost—he presses the needle through fabric, accepting the impossibility of the geographic promise but retaining love's thread as compass. The felt cost is legible in the relinquishment of the literal vow and the acceptance of adaptation. One minor causality slip: the fog lifts and ferry appears exactly when his clarity arrives, reading slightly convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a deepening that reweights the dominant stake (understanding → embodying kindness as temporal force). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's bow and resolve to carry the lesson forward crystallize his stance with felt cost (leaving the oasis behind, accepting its abandonment as reverence rather than restoration). The vision sequence functions as the meaningful tightening that narrows his purpose. Minor cost-proof issue: the exact price of this new purpose remains conceptual rather than foregrounding a specific forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (fire escape, after final petal, moonlit harbor). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—Elara completes her ritual and accepts the cycle—but the cost remains largely emotional and implied rather than viscerally legible on the page. The accumulative lens (ritual action accumulating pressure through the night) holds, though the final move (storing the gauge) doesn't decisively narrow options so much as affirm a stance. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mateo's gaze validates her act, but the piece stops short of a harder choice or visible price that would elevate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the sundial ritual at the stone circle deepens memory, which reweights Elara's stance from burden to stewardship. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts isolation as necessary space and begins archival work with visible cost (continued solitude, bridge role). The tightening is legible: memory surfaces → ritual access → choice to record. Cost is felt but somewhat abstractly articulated ("no longer burdened by solitude").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (who/where/when) within the opening and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers materials, weaves the spiral, and witnesses community formation, culminating in her own offering that completes the circle. The closure—placing "home" into the spiral's heart—functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), foreclosing her prior isolation with visible cost (vulnerability of public confession). One meaningful deepening occurs when strangers begin adding secrets, transforming the installation from solitary act to collective web. The felt cost is present but lightly sketched; the final gesture carries conceptual weight without dramatized resistance or trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and delivers an on-page Decisive Change: the tricksters' signal softens, students reconcile, and Aris accepts Croft's approaching consequence with resolve. Cost is visible—termination looms, modulator may be destroyed—but the causal chain is weakened by heavy exposition (chart marginalia, cosmic background) that tells rather than shows the trickster mechanism. The climax relies on subsonic broadcast mechanics introduced late and summarized rather than tested, creating a modest orientation debt and reducing felt escalation. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is fragile; under Accumulative, the density increase at the ending is present but muted by repetitive thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the fourth paragraph. The nexus's spatial mutiny creates coherent pressure, and Elara's decision to play the organ constitutes an on-page Decisive Change that resolves the geometry and reveals the key—clear closure with cost (overcoming claustrophobia). The escalation from trapped walls to harmonized space follows motivated action. However, the cost feels somewhat muted; Elara's terror is named but the price of her choice (what path is foreclosed, what lasting consequence) remains vague beyond "she remained claustrophobic." The journal fragment mechanic conveniently provides the exact solution without prior setup, weakening causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the quarry investigation layers sensory details and objects (moss, flint, carving, journal) toward a final reconfiguration where Elara reframes Clara's disappearance as "freedom" rather than loss. Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the ribbon fragment placed against carved stone, vow sealed, dormant empathy "now breathed"—but the cost is abstract and told ("she would stir the dormant empathy") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly; the structure is a single continuous scene in one location, fitting 600–800 scope defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The causal chain—nail verdigris matches ink, reveals coordinates, triggers evacuation—is coherent and motivated. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (Aris's exile reversed, lives saved) with visible cost (station destroyed, Elara's prison gone), and the lens holds as Causal throughout. The technician's immediate compliance and the seismic feed confirmation feel slightly convenient but do not break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the opening. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation from grief to renewal), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture, only declared understanding. The causal chain from hitchhiker encounter to playing is more epiphanic than because/therefore: the glass "seemed to glow" and he "understood" without dramatized friction. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in intent but the closure reconfiguration lacks the felt or visible price required to secure higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a cadence shift toward closure, but the resonance is dulled by expository weight. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~120 words. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the currency left behind as "a marker for the next seeker," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—Leo's internal peace is declared, not shown through a final image that reweights prior pressure. The story circles back to its premise without a decisive tightening that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers dream fragments, stellar observation, and Kael's telegram to reweight Elara's solitary stance. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to relational stance) with conceptual cost—the recognition that her isolation was self-imposed. However, the cost reads as primarily internal realization rather than a visible forfeiture; the final image of dawn and shared light is evocative but lacks a concrete on-page price that would make the reconfiguration unmistakable. Orientation is prompt (observatory, Elara, dream-journal in the opening lines), and the accumulative pattern is taught early, but the closure beat would benefit from sharper cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: expanding circles of breath, sound, memory, and intention build density toward the ice-melting resolution. Orientation anchors who and where early; the timeframe ("after the magic trick fails") signals a continuous present. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara accepts her frozen confession, whispers apology, and the plant releases petals as absolution. Cost is legible—she sheds armor and walks away unbent—but the tightening from attempt to resolution feels more like patient accumulation than a narrowing of options under pressure. The inferred lens holds, yet the closure reads quiet and declarative rather than charged by a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake (mend the covenant) is clear, and the story moves through a single scene with one meaningful tightening when the clipping becomes seed. Closure lands on-page with the rift sealed and sapling sprouted, reading as Resonant Reconfiguration (world restored, protagonist anchored). However, cost remains abstract—"forgiven pain" and "healed scar" aestheticize rather than specify what Elara forfeits or loses. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (scars accumulate, clipping reweights at closure), but the final image lacks a sharp, irreversible price that would elevate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael's ritual unfolds through mounting symbolic gestures (orchid petal, river stone, traced symbols, recounted memories) that culminate in the card's silver transformation. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he absorbs Elara's sorrow with visible cost and the hole is "patched with threads of silver." Orientation is present early (catacomb orchard, Kael, the burned card), and the lens holds. However, the escalation is primarily additive ritual rather than a tightening that narrows options; the wisp's appearance and the card's ignition feel inevitable rather than forced by a prior choice that foreclosed alternatives. Cost is legible but the accumulation lacks a decisive pressure point that reweights tactics mid-sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through reflection and sensory anchoring toward a final reconfiguration of purpose. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Leo crystallizes a new path with the final image of pen on paper—but the cost remains abstract ("abandon auction houses") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. Orientation is clean (trailer, quarry, post-failure context by paragraph two). The story satisfies the lens at closure, but the reconfiguration feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through observation failure, analogical thinking, and seed-planting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: renouncing retrieval for acceptance). Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 2). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost: thirty years of quest abandoned, final tears, journal entry marking a new purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arbor's hum stabilizes post-planting, signaling integration rather than loss. Minor slip: the transition from despair to understanding compresses rapidly in the planting sequence, slightly softening the causal texture of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (tide, creel, fragments, smelting) build toward the final image of tidal continuity. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (librarian, atrium, post-tomorrow timeframe). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara continues her ritual with "serene certainty," accepting the cyclical role—but cost is implied rather than on-page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, but the ending restates rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the pearl's history, the shell's confessions, and the cave's latent radiance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the pearl's placement and light-wave release reweight Elias's isolation into connection). Cost is legible: he releases the decades-carried pearl and its absorbed burden. The orientation anchor arrives cleanly in the opening line. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell's confessions mirror his own regret, charging the final placement with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with RR closure (Earned Stasis). Orientation anchors Elara, station, and post-medication timeframe early. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory sharpness, map annotations, patched accordion, and graffiti wisdom, culminating in her choice to leave the map and carry the instrument forward—a renunciation of charted forgiveness for embodied practice. Cost is legible: she releases her chronicler's tools and accepts imperfection. One meaningful deepening occurs when graffiti reweights her river metaphors. Minor slip: the graffiti delivers the thematic turn rather than arising from prior causal pressure, slightly weakening earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where she stands, and what immediate stake she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The dominant stake—to document ephemeral words—is signaled but never tested by a reversal that narrows options. The piece accumulates atmosphere without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final line "spoke her first word aloud, and the silence answered" asserts closure but no felt or visible cost lands on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost. The two letters framing the timeframe are mentioned but do not constrain any on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid (causal setup → accumulative climax with lyric charge). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. The coffee-stain prophecy establishes a clear fork (Archive preservation vs. seed propagation), and Elara's bow-draw triggers the violin's dissolution and the seed's germination—a Decisive Change with visible cost (artifact destroyed). The closure lands on the page with felt loss ("mulberry ache of loss for the vanished artifact") and new life, satisfying the DC + cost requirement. Minor deduction: the coffee-reading mechanism appears once and does not constrain later tactics; the prophecy functions more as exposition than as a recurring constraint that shapes attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The threshold of stillness is reached through pattern recognition and ritual completion, providing a coherent closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Cost is visible in the vow fulfilled and the spark captured, but the escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than a meaningful tightening of options—Elara faces no substantive obstacle or choice that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves through elevation (tree-climbing) to ritual (scalloping) with thematic density increasing toward the final groove. Orientation anchors arrive early (grotto caretaker, post-forgiveness). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the completed scallop and thumb-run offer a quiet image of contentment found in present ritual—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible path is foreclosed or tactic altered on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs but lacks the felt price that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elara's interpretive method (wind chimes) guides Kael toward releasing physical tokens (cloak, shard) that externalize internal change. Orientation anchors (cliffside, dawn, lighthouse) arrive early. The closure—unhooking the cloak and dropping the shard—lands on the page with visible physical acts and a tonal shift toward peace. However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatically earned; Kael's twenty-year guilt dissolves in a single session without visible friction or setback, reducing the felt weight of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates detail (grotto → pond → rings → pattern → spiral) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the final image (pond stilled, unified mirror) crystallizes Aris's purpose with visible cost (another day reversed, memories sharpening/fading). Closure lands on the page with felt cost. However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive slowly across the first ~150 words through dense, lyric description rather than swift grounding, creating mild disorientation debt. The trance itself is a single continuous beat without a meaningful tightening or deepening—insight unfolds but options do not narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the Pulse's bifurcation is revealed through the bird pattern, then integrated through Corbin's humming, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) where he becomes the canyon's anchor. Cost is conceptual—he "did not rise… did not need to," foreclosing physical motion—but the price feels more stated than viscerally demonstrated. Orientation is present by line five (elder in throne, canyon). One meaningful deepening occurs when the flock splits, reweighting the stakes from "lost Pulse" to "bifurcated Pulse needing integration."

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image (upward mercury, suspended snowflakes, lingering luminance) and culminates in Elara's Earned Stasis—leaving the keystone glowing, refusing to commodify it. Orientation is clear by the opening (Elara, guild dismissal, icebound spire task). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she returns empty-handed, plants a seed instead), and the final moonflower image reweights the premise of slow, tended magic versus automation. One meaningful deepening occurs: her encounter with the keystone shifts her from retrieval to renunciation, foreclosing the guild's path with visible consequence (she defies the task, accepts underachiever status, cultivates her own light).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (lamplighter, pier, low tide, sunken ship) appear by the opening paragraphs and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery and motifs (lanterns, light, color, vows) accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the key's lock-and-discovery beat lacks causal friction—Elias finds exactly what he seeks with no complication or narrowing of options. The logbook's contents answer his quest directly, but the *cost* of this answer is asserted ("tears mingling with seawater") rather than made legible through a foreclosed path or tactical shift. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (love's chromatic signature becomes eternal understanding) but the on-page *felt* cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, observatory deck, post-contraction universe). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through static bursts, coin interpretation, and ritual deepening. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara confirms her vigil role with acceptance. However, the cost is oblique: no live alternative is dramatized or refused on the page; "stellar doubt" softens into "solemn peace" without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The ending image (coins at rest, waiting for the next burst) reaffirms rather than reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: each named monster crystallizes and Kael's grief shifts incrementally toward purpose. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraphs), and the closure—naming the void-beast and transforming the atlas—lands on the page with visible cost (tears, gathering "every fragment of scattered light"). One meaningful deepening occurs as each naming reweights his heartbreak. The causal chain is motivated by his unique attribute and the recordings, though the escalation reads more as ritual repetition than true narrowing of options or rising external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (sapphire viaduct, Elara, broken bell), and the accumulative lens—drip-by-drip restoration building to the bell's ring and fish's leap—holds coherently to closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending (the bell whole, the fish leaping, covenant reignited) lands on the page with felt cost: Elara's 73 dawns of observation, her tears, and the acknowledgment that healing requires "many dawns of this work" ahead. However, causality is thin: we see only one session of dripping; the bell's sudden wholeness at zenith and the fish's immediate appearance feel more like lyric convergence than because/therefore linkage, and no mid-story tightening narrows options or raises stakes—pressure accumulates texturally rather than through decision points that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early and are clear. The piece opts for an accumulative/textural lens: Elara descends, finds the bottle, experiences memory, and reaffirms her mission. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reweighting her purpose from sorrow to connection), but the final image—"no longer a path of shadows, but an illuminated conduit for memory"—is stated theme rather than a dramatized cost. No live option is foreclosed on the page; she intended to rescue artifacts and does so without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (waterfall, orchard, starlings) toward a final crystallization. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening—Elara moves from frustration to epiphany without a causal bridge or visible cost; the starlings' appearance feels coincidental rather than earned. The closure unit (crystal glowing, walls dissolving) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "her own fractures mend" tells the change without showing what was risked or lost. One meaningful deepening is present (frustration → revelation), meeting minimum scope, but the pivot arrives via external spectacle rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: static → silence → pattern observation → revision → restored trust. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (midnight pattern seeker, arbor above clouds, after static clears). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the revision act and Commander Vance's acknowledgment reweight the parachute buckle from failure symbol to courage token, with visible cost in the tear and the ongoing burden. The tightening is sufficient for this length, moving from fractured pattern to confirmed stability.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (void + memory archive → vivification). Orientation anchors arrive early. The vivification itself (fluid glows gold, pathways ignite) offers a visual change, but the "new consciousness" appears without on-page cost or foreclosed path—Kaela simply gains warmth and the custody battle "dissolves into irrelevance." No visible price is paid; the closure reads as reward without sacrifice. The ending reconfigures meaning thematically but lacks the felt or opportunity cost required for RR or CR at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens and holds it: Elias's sound ritual builds density until the echo chamber returns Clara's laughter, then releases into lighter silence. Orientation anchors quickly (root cellar, dusk, after Clara's death). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the house "exhaled," parents show faint release, Elias will return—but the cost remains implied rather than sharply legible; we see effect (lighter silence, a sigh) without a clear forfeiture or irreversible change on Elias's part.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the piece establishes a situational lens where pressure accumulates through the rift's appearance and the guardian's vigil. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis—the guardian releases the pendant and refuses the return—with felt cost (the ache transformed, the path foreclosed). The cost is legible in "consciously loosened its grip" and "reject the deep friendship forged," though the final two paragraphs abstract the outcome rather than leaving the image to resonate, slightly diluting the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Elara's seventy-three failures, successive approximation method, and the creative-destruction epiphany drive the transformation. Orientation is prompt (character, setting, object by paragraph two). The closure—staff blooming with autonomous life—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (renunciation of repair in favor of destruction). Minor weakness: the epiphany moment ("the penny drops") is told rather than shown through a concrete sensory or tactical shift, softening the causal linkage at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through the layering of reflective releases rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara shifts from seeking to listening, and the fragment fuses to the dial, foreclosing the quest with felt cost. However, the cost is largely asserted ("quest fulfilled, yet transformed") rather than made visceral on the page, and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (ferry deckhand, twilight crossing). The piece reads as Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: spectral imagery and pattern-language build density, but the ending relies on a causal solve (broadcast harmonic frequency, turn hourglass → timelines merge). The closure unit—docking safely, hourglass in hand—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "permanent transient" etched in his soul), yet the conceptual cost is asserted rather than felt on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the "collective intent" of other selves arrives without prior setup. The solution (harmonic broadcast via shanty and hourglass flip) lands abruptly in the grotto without prior cause-and-effect linkage to establish why this exact method would work.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the eruption sequence, and the final image reweights the opening stance. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (she will "weave again" with new humility), but the cost is atmospheric rather than clearly legible in a specific forfeited action or changed relationship. The eruption beat provides a meaningful tightening, yet causality remains soft—memories "burst forth" without prior dramatized resistance or a choice that triggers the release. Orientation anchors are present early (gallery, loom, thread).

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the chain link's geometry accumulates meaning across demonstration, hologram superimposition, and student replication, culminating in Lyra's transformed stance. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of "unfolded horizons" and Lyra's declaration crystallize the conceptual shift with felt cost implied by "no longer buried." However, the cost remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or trade-off is dramatized; the "crushing deep" and "arduous path" are asserted rather than tested in tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present by paragraph two (atrium, twilight, Elara's role). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail and the hearing-aid pulse, culminating in Lily's acceptance and the mist's glow. However, the closure unit (Lily's tears and smile, the atrium's glow) lacks a legible *cost*—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the resolution is additive (more voices fortified) without friction. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Elara or Lily loses something tangible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (salt/decay, crashing hush, gold pulse) building to the frost-script revelation that reweights all prior material. Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aris completes the circuit of remembrance, transforming claustrophobia into sanctuary with visible cost (codex abandoned, near-drowning escape). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line two. The tidal timeframe creates coherent pressure throughout, and the phase-transition method shapes the climactic beat with cost legible in the frozen codex and rising water.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, when anchors arrive but remain vague past 120 words ("opal observatory" and "death certificate error survivor" require substantial unpacking; "after the radio static had finally cleared" offers temporal mood but no concrete stake). The closure unit—Elara's life record verified and new protocols imbued—is told rather than shown with visible cost; the "digital ghost dissolved" is metaphorical summary, not a decisive change legible on the page. Drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric-accumulative elements clash with causal framing), and no on-page reversal narrows options. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test; apply −0.4 in Q2 for lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (copper-veined storyteller, canyon of bone towers, the tunnel) arrive cleanly by the first third. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sixty dawns of observation, tactile-to-auditory translation, and the convergence of flock patterns and diamond topology build density until the final word releases the language into permanence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the language reborn as echoing sound, the diamond placed in the niche) with conceptual cost legible in "the weight of centuries lift" and the finality of her departure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond warms and the curse reveals itself as dormancy, narrowing her tactical window and reweighting the stakes toward a single culminating utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit—Aris's decision to protect rather than expose—lands on the page with a clear before/after, but the cost remains more asserted than viscerally felt. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (密ity increase toward a stance crystallization), yet the metamorphosis sequence accumulates atmosphere without tightening Aris's options causally. The lens holds at closure, but the escalation lacks a meaningful pivot that narrows her path with undeniable friction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece orients quickly (sky-bridge, orchard, evening) and builds to an on-page Decisive Change: the monolith shatters, statues crumble, orchard blooms. The causal chain is present—locust shell amplifies heartbeat, music cracks statues, Elara descends and uproots—but the mechanics of how heartbeat-music specifically breaks granite feel asserted rather than earned through prior constraint or cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when statues crack and she must act, meeting the length requirement, though the cost at closure (torn fingers, resolve) reads as minor given the scale of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Kael, cobalt arcade, twilight mail drop). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbolic detail (thunderstorm bottle, hidden ledger, repurposed drone) toward a thematic reconfiguration rather than a causal turn. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael walks away lighter, having "found his compass"—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("purpose replacing sorrow's weight") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice. The storm-bottle use occurs without immediate consequence; no patrol catches him, no relationship shifts on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the drone launch), but the final image restates theme rather than reweighting prior pressure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational (discovery-driven). Orientation anchors by ~66 words (Elara, coastal highway, carousel carpenter, daughter's loss). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): she moves from sealed silence to voice and commitment to return, forecloses the grief-paralysis path. Cost is visible—twelve years of silence broken, peace earned through song—and the final image of her smile reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sings and the halo responds. Causality is mostly clean but the "wrong turn" coincidence launches the sequence without prior setup, and the carousel's magical responsiveness (eyes softening, wood alive) introduces late unmarked rules that convenience the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increases through memory layering; closure reweights the scarf and geometry motifs). Orientation anchors are clear by line 19. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): Elara shifts from seeking an external location to recognizing the "resonant dimension born between teller and listener" (line 208). The cost is conceptual—the abandonment of her search for a tangible place—and is legible in the final image (lines 251, 259). One meaningful deepening occurs when the memory fuses with present understanding (line 181), reweighting the hyperbolic diagram from metaphor to literal map. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt; the shift is cerebral and the story does not dramatize what Elara sacrifices or what new constraint this understanding imposes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (Elara, library turret, pre-dawn vigil). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the photograph does not match the courtyard but reveals "the dream's emotional essence," reweighting her decade-long search as an internal state rather than external recovery. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes the literal courtyard hunt—but the final image ("luminous absence transformed") makes this undeniable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the developed photograph contradicts expectation yet delivers thematic resolution, tightening her understanding of "home." The lens holds; escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift at the darkroom beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by the second paragraph, so no penalty applies. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing (the idea of enduring love is freed and sent into the cosmos), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page decision forecloses a path, and the locksmith's state before/after is identical. The causal chain is weak: the star's light triggers the fracture reveal, but the locksmith's recitation of Elara's words and pressing the hair into the stone feel like ritual steps rather than because/therefore linkage. The miles-away Elara beat is told convenience, not earned closure. The story teaches a lyric/accumulative pattern but does not land a decisive change or reweight prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Aris, sunken orchard, evening, thirty-two years after avoidance began. The causal lens dominates: Elara's journal shatters resolve → Aris travels to the site → follows prescribed method → alignment detected → memories return → closure offered by tipping mushroom into pool. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: decades of avoidance broken, truth now carried as compass) lands on the page with visible emotional cost and a clear before/after. One minor slip: "The chronically curious folklorist finally understood" in the penultimate beat risks summarizing theme rather than letting the image carry it, nudging the closure toward told insight rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The closure—Elara inscribing "Return" and Kael stepping forward—functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize and the mentor-student dynamic shifts from instruction to shared navigation. Cost is legible in Kael's choice to "close the distance" rather than retreat, though Elara's emotional or relational price remains underdramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs (the tea-leaf reading transforms from skepticism to tentative hope), meeting length requirements. No major causality breaks; the swing motif accumulates meaning across beats and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates poetic density through the visualization sequence, but closure reads as completion rather than reconfiguration—the seed glows, she will plant it, wonder will bloom. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the final image affirms prior intent without reweighting cost or foreclosing a live alternative. Cost is asserted ("a single tear") but not dramatized as a tradeoff that changes tactics or stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates silence through a pattern of knot-unraveling that reweights the stake from restless spirits to Elara's own fractured spirit, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (her fractures mend with acceptance). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final knot reveals the fisherman's sacrifice, charging the closure image. Cost is visible: Elara's tears and the shift from "restorer of broken things" to "weaver of solace" forecloses her prior defensive posture. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase—layered sensory detail, historical accumulation, comparative evidence—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara grasps the henge-vault partnership and resolves to "pass the whisper forward." Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by ~100 words). Cost is conceptual and felt ("weight of understanding," stewardship over ownership) but remains somewhat abstract; pointing to a specific sentence where tactical options narrow or a social price is paid proves difficult, which prevents entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aris moves from clinging to Elara's recording toward acceptance, the "stone in his chest" shifting with "soft finality." The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the library descent, tape restoration, and snow globe observation, culminating in the conceptual reweighting at closure. Cost is felt (emotional stone remains but settles) though not sharply visible in a forfeited action. Orientation is clean by line 30. The piece follows a single continuous dive with reflection blocks totaling ~25%, anchored in present stimuli (snow globe, tape, captain's voice). One minor gap: the Earhart headline (line 45) gestures at global context but never returns or constrains a choice, reading as ornamental setup.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara carves symbols in sequence, building toward the final circle and thunder. Orientation anchors (misty courtyard, balladeer, flower press bolt plate) arrive early. However, the closure—Elara feeling "heard" and descending with certainty—lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The thunder "celebrates" rather than complicates, and the final lines assert transformation in the city below without dramatizing a trade-off or renunciation that would satisfy Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing standards. The enumerated symbols (spiral, fractured line, cluster of stars) compress the middle but do not deepen or tighten options; they accumulate texture without escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: ascending elevator, deepening revelations, density increase toward the final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—lands on the page when Kael places the artifacts and carries the lesson forward with visible cost (his "irrevocably altered" perception). The escalation reads as cadence shift and reweighting of the dominant stake (finding joy beneath anguish). One meaningful deepening is present, though the stakes themselves never narrow options sharply; Kael's journey is more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates cloud observations in a stable pattern, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fallstreak hole as visible absence) that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost (the cathartic sob, the completed journal). Closure is on the page with emotional cost. Minor deduction: the drift itself is passive situation rather than protagonist-driven causality, and the single-location catalogue structure offers minimal escalation beyond density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coin discovery deepens and reweights Elara's understanding of limits, shifting her stance from preservation-of-vastness to acceptance-of-bounded-infinity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image of carrying "the entire sky in the palm of her hand" reweights the premise with felt cost (abandoning twenty years of mural work). One quibble: the tightening from external threat (demolition) to internal realization could be more causally interleaved; the crew's arrival functions mostly as a timer rather than a pressure that forces the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (airship, Elara, primary lamp dimmed). The causal chain is linear: observation → cross-reference → sequence → compartment → lamp → success. Closure is a Decisive Change (ship reanimated), but the cost is absent—no tradeoff, no path foreclosed, only triumph. The lens reads Causal with clean because/therefore links, but the final beat lacks the felt price required for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors emerge slowly (library suspended above clouds, frost-veined shelves, Elara's title) but cohere by ~200 words without disorientation debt. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images (mirrors, light, gears) and motifs (driftwood, brightness, rhythm) culminate in the gear's installation and the hum of restored time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from longing to connection, the library transforms from tomb to sanctuary—but the cost remains abstract ("honoring" vs. "fixing"); no concrete path is visibly foreclosed. One meaningful deepening (understanding wear patterns, reharmonizing) satisfies the length, but the final image recaps theme rather than charging prior choices with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Veridia, floating arches, orchard family). The drive lens reads Situational-leaning-Accumulative: Elara's messages guide collective action, the bell discovery escalates, and the midnight alignment pays off. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's departure, the family's inheritance of stewardship) with felt cost (her vanishing), but the cost is primarily emotional rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. The nebula alignment resolves the blight conveniently; no failure mode or live trade-off sharpens the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~37 words (Elara, lighthouse, dusk). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lullaby is channeled through mechanism, spirals unfold, and the final image (the pane now holding "gentle hum") reweights the opening "hush." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the nested patterns dissolve into starlight, Elara's vigil complete, universe cradled). Cost is felt—exhaustion, solitude redeemed—though entirely emotional rather than a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. One meaningful deepening (alignment → beacon flare → dissolution) is present and legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Causal: finding the nut enables assembly, assembly triggers the birds, the luminous trail saves the family—clean because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (cliffside orchard), and the ticking clock (twilight/frost) by the third paragraph. Closure is Earned Stasis—she will repeat the ritual despite reluctance, forecloses escape, cost is felt in "every instinct begged her to flee"—but the final image disperses into multiple summary sentences rather than crystallizing in one charged beat, slightly softening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the accumulative/textural lens is legible. The closure unit—Aris's decision to write the letter crediting Elara—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize and meaning reweights. Cost is implied (he must publicly acknowledge his dismissal of her ethics) but not dramatized on the page with a specific forfeiture or friction that alters tactics. The piece teaches its reflective, accumulative pattern early and holds it through the ending, but the final image feels more like thematic summation than a charged moment where pressure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through lyric description and philosophical reflection toward the moment of incision, which triggers the moonlight eruption and the customer's arrival. However, the closure unit (the incision sealing her quest) lacks visible cost—Elara's gesture succeeds without foreclosing a path or imposing a trade-off. The final image (customer offering a glass-leaf token) feels like affirmation rather than reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rain → puddles → tidal pool → coral pavilion builds through linked imagery toward a closure image where ice melts and the glow shifts from cold blue to amber. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. However, the closure unit—remorse alchemized into "tempered truth"—is asserted rather than shown through a decisive on-page change in Aris's options or stance. The cost is told ("Weight settled deep in his bones") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or visible consequence that alters subsequent action.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader doesn't understand the "grain elevator talks" premise or its mechanism until well past the opening third, creating significant comprehension debt (−0.4). The closure—restored communication among silos—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is mechanical: a wedged weight stops the clock, she removes it, talks resume. No meaningful tightening of options or felt cost is visible; Elara faces no decision that forecloses a path. The inferred lens is Causal, but the linkage reads as simple repair rather than escalating pressure or deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation or causal linkage occurs; the piece presents a static tableau of Elara receiving memories without resistance or cost. The "closure" (gathering shards, planning to return) is an announced intention rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and why she's here emerges gradually through exposition rather than anchored action. The drive lens remains ambiguous: accumulative texture is gestured at but no pattern crystallizes or breaks to reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links (doodle → grotto location → inversion timing → combinations retrieved), and the protagonist achieves her stated goal on the page. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara obtains all three vault combinations without forfeiting anything or facing a constraint that narrows her options at the end. The final image gestures toward future work ("planting her own seeds") but does not reconfigure what came before with felt price. Orientation is prompt (cliff path, chronometer, grotto), and the inversion mechanism is signaled early, meeting baseline causal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early (siskin alder grove, dawn, Elara) and operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through the strumming sequence until the siskin's answering trill and the final image reconfigure the silence from "thick with unspoken stories" to "alive with possibility." The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence is deepened, enriched), and the cost is legible in Elara's tears and the phrase "single true note offered with respect." However, the causal linkage between analyzing stress cracks and producing sound is asserted rather than dramatized—how porcelain on wood yields distinct pitches for different cracks is never shown—which softens the closure's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric recurrence (worry stone dent, chess metaphors, eclipse motif). Orientation anchors are present early (magnetic nexus, Elias, exile backstory). However, the closure unit—Elias reframing the dent and walking east—leans heavily on summary reflection ("He carried a translated silence") rather than a decisive on-page action or image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The cost is stated ("sorrow of lost students") but not dramatized in the final beats, reducing closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory and metaphorical description toward a final image of "connection" and "healing quiet." However, no meaningful on-page reversal occurs—Elara begins empathetic, completes her ritual without friction, and ends empathetic with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The promised visit to Mr. Henderson remains future-tense intention, not enacted closure. Under Accumulative standards, a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with felt cost is required; here the ending restates the premise rather than transforming it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative lens is inferred and holds: sensory details, ritual actions, and journaling beats build density toward a final image that reweights serenity from external achievement to internal practice. Closure arrives on-page through Resonant Reconfiguration (the shoot emerges; Elara's understanding shifts from conquest to harmonization). Cost is visible in the relinquished ambition and the acceptance of future trial ("odor...no longer a threat"). The orientation is clear early (treetop village, herbalist, dawn balcony), and the tightening from seed arrival to germination is legible and purposeful under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Kael, orchard planet, inversion hour) arrive cleanly in the opening. The story accumulates pressure through water-flow navigation, accelerated growth observations, and converging echoes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael's mission shifts from extraction to stewardship, and he pockets the arrow tip "warm with purpose, its journey complete." Cost is conceptual—he forgoes a trophy and accepts the role of listener—legible in the final image but somewhat abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when he dips the twig and witnesses transformation, reweighting his understanding of resilience as memory rather than resource.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation cleanly (investigator, post-evacuation port, container labyrinth) and maintains a causal arc: documenting wind → discovering oscillation physics → finding Croft's patch → recommending protocols. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing): Kael exits with the patch as compass, committed to prevention. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture; the final image reweights "singular convergence" from abstract theory to personal-professional legacy. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes sustained oscillation, not a single gust, caused failure. Visible cost is implicit (the weight of shared profession, the silence transformed to safeguard) but legible in the final paragraph's tone shift and the patch "carried lightly."

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first 150+ words without purposeful pattern. The piece declares a goal (unfetter light) but offers no on-page reversal or tightening; each bell strike produces the expected result without complication. The "cosmic synchronicity" and sculptor's chisel moment are asserted without causal linkage or dramatized cost. Closure is a declared state ("wonder is essential") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible price. The dominant lens remains ambiguous—neither causal turn nor accumulative density shift nor situational stance crystallization is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, and when are anchored by ~120 words, but the lens remains ambiguous—accumulative/textural and causal both compete without a taught pattern. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight harvested, peace achieved), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: Kael leaves lighter, with "purpose renewed," yet no path is visibly foreclosed. The before/after is legible, but the price remains conceptual and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals Accumulative/Textural intent (starlight captured in topaz walls, the halo fragment's indigo-to-gold shift), but the core escalation is asserted rather than causally built: Elara's panic and the collision of borrowed emotions are told as summary, then resolved by intellectual insight ("the equation required the ambiguity"). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns to the press with "lucid peace"—but the felt cost is unclear; the shift from disorientation to calm happens off-stage between paragraphs. Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the first paragraph). The Before (seeking "elegant calculus") and After (embracing "the dance itself") are legible, yet the moment of change lacks on-page friction or visible foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors Kael, ridgeway, and aurora by the opening lines. The closure unit—germination of the luminous plant and Kael's rekindled purpose—lands on the page with visible change, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration (the jitter is replaced by steady vibration, and the plant becomes a tangible bridge). However, the cost remains oblique: no concrete forfeiture or trade-off is legible; the pendant simply activates and the transformation follows without sacrifice. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (memory deepens → plant grows → purpose renews), but the final reweighting lacks the felt price that would elevate closure strength.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and sustains a single POV through one continuous scene. Causality follows: Kael communes, sees chaos, breeze shifts perception, spiral emerges, memory corrects theory, assumption shatters. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—objects absorb sincerity over volume—with felt cost (his "firmly grounded nature" must expand beyond desired proof). Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the breeze and spiral function as pattern breaks that reweight the dominant stake. However, the reversal hinges on a memory cue rather than an on-page decision or sacrifice, softening the causal pressure and leaving cost more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric density and motif recurrence early; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara woven into the tapestry, sapling emerging) with conceptual cost legible in her translucence and the orchard's fade. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words and remain stable. However, escalation reads as inevitability rather than tightening—no reversal or complication narrows her options; she proceeds from fraying threads to clearing the loom to weaving to completion without a meaningful pressure point that changes tactics. The cost is visible at closure, but the path to it is processional rather than driven by because/therefore linkage or a cadence shift that reweights stakes mid-flight.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a clear causal sequence: barter → descent → ritual → planetary healing. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the land heals, Kael gains "unshakable strength"), and the cost—the surrendered memory—is established early. However, the final image feels more like thematic summary ("a guardian who coaxes hope from rubble") than a decisive crystallization that reweights prior material with fresh pressure. The lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid; the accumulative texture (azure imagery, roots, rubble) supports but does not fully charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves through parallel-universe vignettes that layer sensory evidence until the truth crystallizes. Orientation is prompt (~40 words) and the closure—learning Kael's sacrifice and internalizing its weight—lands on the page with a stance shift. However, the cost is more stated ("weight... settled upon her") than shown through a foreclosed option or visible consequence that alters her tactics. The resonant reconfiguration relies on summary rather than a decisive image that makes the before/after legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias renounces solitary silence by constructing the Phoenix Stack, entrusting the legacy to Elara with visible ritual cost. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through memory, stone placement, and the sea glass motif. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elias moves from grief to active guardianship. The cost is felt in his "luminescent ache" and the physical act of kneeling and stacking, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the storm sequence, the shadow-glyphs accumulate meaning, and the final beach image reweights the premise with a quiet conceptual cost (the work goes unwitnessed, "no headline"). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the lighthouse routine is repriced as meaningful despite its invisibility—but the cost remains largely asserted rather than felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm integrates rather than erases, satisfying the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational shading. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly (Elara, tea house, post-transplant). Escalation operates via density increase—mist, dust motes, spiderweb—building to the wing's blue flash at midpoint, then extending through tearful recognition to resolve in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Elara reweights her craft's purpose. Cost is conceptual (shift from collecting to reflecting) but the on-page image of tears and bowing provides felt charge. The closure lands, though the because/therefore linkage between the blue flash and the final resolve remains more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through three seasons of dream-mapping toward a moonlight activation, but the closure beat—sextant healing and revealing tree memories—arrives through coincidence (pin drop, cloud gap) rather than Elara's agency or a pattern break that reweights her stake with cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied (Elara, tower corridor, storm night established early). Closure form reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (her role "evolved"), yet the cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt on the page: no live option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The piece teaches its lens adequately but the final image does not tighten or deepen pressure—it opens into wisdom without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—fragments coalesce through ritual—and the mica window's transformation at closure reweights the dominant stake with visible cost (tears, memory alignment, shared hope). Orientation anchors (mirror world, greenhouse, Elara) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the song pulls luminous threads and awakens the Heartseed, narrowing the endless night. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (mosaic mind settling, communities knitting), but the cost is more aesthetic than viscerally felt—no live option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara chooses not to descend, accepting her isolation as agency rather than cage, with the smoothed invitation as closure marker. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The causal chain linking past mistake → hiding → ritual → realization → renewed purpose holds, though the middle segment relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page turns. Cost is present but diffuse: she remains physically apart, her reintegration deferred, making the price more conceptual than visceral at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the palace courtyard intro. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (tenuous absolution via the planted seeds and shared bread), with felt cost embedded in the phrase "tenuous as clover shoots" and the transformation of the pocket crust from relic to compass. One meaningful deepening occurs when Madame Lin reveals the bread, reweighting memory and possibility. Cost is visible but somewhat diffuse—the absolution remains abstract rather than forecloses a concrete path with sharp on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early: Elara samples frequencies, records data, and transfers the vow to the archive, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she turns to the next slide with resolve. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by the opening paragraphs. The closure image—"The library held its breath, and Elara worked on"—crystallizes her stance with felt cost (endless repetition, isolation), though the cost is more atmospheric than a sharp forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide dies and she honors the transition rather than mourns, reweighting her task as "midwifed meaning."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. The closure lands on-page with visible cost—Elara's recording captures both breaking and repair, reweighting her quest. Each false start causally narrows Silas's options until the truce shatters, then her evidence-based intervention rebuilds it. The two-shard structure (interventions, then climax) is clear. Minor issue: the "curious vow" framing at line 82 feels slightly expositional, but the closure unit itself is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes clear orientation early (lavender bluff, aurora, forest elections) and follows an accumulative/textural lens that builds through sensory intensification to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the stone circle. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara's understanding crystallizes with the personal rain and her glow shift from silver to gold, reweighting her skepticism with felt acceptance. The cost is somewhat diffuse—skepticism dissolves rather than being paid for with a specific forfeiture—but the final image of carrying weather "like a quiet promise" reconfigures the opening doubt. The forest election and aurora convergence feel more ornamental than causally necessary, creating slight lens ambiguity in the middle third before the accumulative design clarifies at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, cave, post-laughter silence) and follows a causal chain: broken lock → search for sketch → portrait reveals numbers → compartment opens → note releases creativity. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (suppressed creativity uncorked), yet the decisive turn is triggered by the discovered note rather than a choice Elara makes that forecloses a path with on-page cost—she does not sacrifice, refuse, or endure against resistance; the lock mechanism and hidden compartment appear as puzzle solutions rather than pressure points that narrow options. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric texture, and while the final image (dawn sketch, charcoal in pocket) reweights prior material, the cost remains asserted ("dam shattered") rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers candor moments toward a final reweighting. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The closure—Elara as "gardener of moments" who will now honor small truths—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is more asserted than felt; the neighbor's orchids provide a reprise, yet the stakes never visibly narrow or force a trade-off. The chamber revelation tells us lost conversations live in candor rather than showing Elara sacrifice or foreclose a prior belief with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The story accumulates atmospheric density and reaches a crescendo, then closes on quiet satisfaction—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, cost is asserted ("purpose fulfilled," "profound peace") rather than made visible through a forfeited option or felt friction. The sculpture's cycle completes without dramatized resistance or trade-off, weakening closure legibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Unit Seven completes the ritual, scatters ash, and resumes rounds with "integrated peace." The cost is conceptual—Lena's fears are destroyed, memories no longer fragment—but the final image of the new bud and "fragmented wholeness" reconfigures the opening static into acceptance. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the ritual's steps deepen pressure through contained symbolism. One friction: the magnetic-north inciting incident vanishes after setup; it triggers the crisis but doesn't constrain tactics or return at closure, weakening causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens through neighborhood storytelling that builds toward the locket revelation. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dawn courtyard, thrift curator, locked mailbox). The closure unit—key opens mailbox, photograph placed, demolition notice removed—lands on the page but the cost is diffuse and social rather than personal to Elara; the city official's convenient emotional pivot replaces earned consequence. The timeframe tightens stakes nominally (noon deadline) but resolution hinges on the official's unexplained change of heart, a coincidental resolve that weakens causal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the buoy releases, carrying research and her message, and she accepts solitude with agency (Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis). Cost is present but muted—she remains trapped yet feels connected. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through decoder-dance cycles until the third-chime insight releases the buoy. Causality holds at the macro level (journal → dance → insight → valve turn → buoy), though the "listen" epiphany arrives conveniently after dice and dance without clear dramatized friction that the dance resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure occurs on the page: Elara exhumes Lyra's memory, experiences its return, and seals the wildflowers in the geode, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (the chamber's gravity stills, the harbor's silence transforms). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through setting details, the whale's symbolic tear, and the salt chamber's prismatic imagery, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is implied (decades of absence, tears, the act of sealing the flowers) but not shown as a present-moment forfeiture or trade-off that narrows future options. The narrative holds a single POV across two spatial shards (harbor to chamber) within one contiguous window, meeting Track A defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when by the opening paragraph (orientation satisfied). However, the closure—dissolving the prophecy by exhaling "smoothed hush"—lacks visible cost; Elara achieves her goal without forfeiting options or enduring friction. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mapping silence as landscape, silvery ripples), but the final image offers satisfaction without reconfiguration or price. No meaningful tightening narrows her choices; the sequence flows and-then without causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara moves from forceful interrogation to compassionate stewardship, crystallized when she receives the seal and understands Dr. Thorne's living wisdom. Cost is present—she abandons her prior extractive method—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the meteor shower, tea ritual, and seal combining to reweight her stance. Orientation anchors early (rooftop, meteor shower, tea). The tightening occurs when Mrs. Davison reveals the cornerstone fiction, which reframes Elara's entire archival approach, though the causality is more conceptual than action-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is stable (who, where, when by early paragraphs). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density accumulates through the ritual beats, and the final image (crystal wrapped, shell buried) reconfigures the quarantined memory into archived independence. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (grief transformed into "enduring strength"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical choice that forecloses a live option. The ritual unfolds as a sequence of steps without a meaningful tightening or complication that tests Elara's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by line 5 (who, where, when). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual sequence—thorn press, keyhole bloom, key turn, dripping cease/resume, rose bloom—builds density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness earned through ceremonial acts). Closure lands on the page as Kael's departure with "the gentle certainty that to forgive the unfinished is the final, calibrated act of grace," but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt or visible; no on-page choice is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening under its lens—each ritual step proceeds without resistance or reversal. The Orientation Test is satisfied; the lens is held; closure form is RR but cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (shell disclosures deepen understanding; closure reconfigures the nexus from prison to sanctuary). The closure image offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the nexus transformed), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no tactic altered by prior pressure. The three-part disclosure structure provides a clear pattern, yet the final beat summarizes release ("trapped emotions flowed free") instead of dramatizing the moment of transformation with a concrete image that carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: the melted snow globe shifts from loss-symbol to love-delivery vessel, and the rainbow refraction acts as silent affirmation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly by the second paragraph. However, causality is thin—Elara's dream-dive succeeds without friction, Lena's role is entirely offstage, and the letter-writing constitutes the sole on-page action with no visible cost or tactical shift. The closure reweights meaning but lacks felt price; the "courage to share truth" is asserted, not dramatized through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean early (who, where, when anchored by line 3). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density builds through layered images (net, whisk, fireflies, moon paths) toward a final crystallization of philosophy. However, no on-page decisive change or renunciation occurs—the protagonist begins appreciating hidden effort and ends appreciating it, with no foreclosed path or felt cost. The closure reads as thematic summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Elara's decision to rebury the letters and protect the myth is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation) with visible cost—she abandons her life's work of debunking. The causal lens holds throughout; discovery of the letters → reconstruction → understanding → choice to conceal. One meaningful tightening occurs when she grasps the stillpoint's fragility. Orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in her becoming "silent sentinel," forgoing revelation for guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and teaches a mosaic structure (observatory → Oakhaven → citadel → back) with legible transitions. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the ionosphere-clearing miracle and the vault discovery, reweighting the dominant stake (ancient knowledge versus rigid doctrine) with on-page cost—children's laughter and Hemlock's gratitude charge the final image. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's isolation transforms into collaborative unfolding) with felt cost visible in her tears and the mosaic built from "fragmented frequencies." One meaningful deepening occurs when the twenty-three-second clarity lands the solution, tightening options and foregrounding the collaborative tapestry theme.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored in the opening lines), and the piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the poet winds the music box, captures the sound, seals the jar, and places it on the shelf. However, the closure lacks visible cost—sealing a jar and crying does not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off; the character ends in the same state he began (isolated, ritualistic, content). The final paragraphs summarize his ongoing practice and peaceful completion rather than dramatizing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt pressure. Cost is asserted ("bridges built") but not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pressure builds through sensory intensification and harmonic repair iterations). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (lighthouse engineer, granite pier, drift-ice marina). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—the Chime's restoration and Elara's fulfilled duty crystallize a stable new state with conceptual cost (sacred trust maintained, but the mechanism of absolution charges the final image). However, the escalation is a single deepening (strike, listen, refine loop) without a meaningful reversal or narrowing of options; the stabilizer failure is solved by applying a forgotten method with no setback or trade-off dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear causality: rain cleanses the viaduct, moonlight refracts through it, sigil activates, energy releases. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the moss emerging, the revolution beginning) with felt cost visible in the crack and Elara's transformation. Orientation anchors are present (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, twilight) but the window between setup and climax feels compressed, leaving limited room for escalation. The cost—seven winters of waiting crystallized in one ritual moment—is legible but somewhat告知 rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Elara investigates → discovers evidence → resolves to expose. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (tunnel, Thomas's case, lantern discovery). However, the decisive change occurs off-page; the final paragraphs assert future action ("she would present," "she would be the instrument") rather than showing a choice or renunciation with immediate cost. The closure reads as Charged Poise, but the cost remains declarative rather than felt in a concrete moment.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through the repair sequence and pays off when the music box plays "Amazing Grace." Orientation is prompt (shop, Elias, the box) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's apology transforms into actionable purpose with felt cost (accepting mercy he doesn't feel he deserves). The cost is emotional and legible at lines 238–247. However, the key reversal (the hairline fracture discovery, 191) is triggered by a deus ex machina shaft of light rather than Elias's agency or prior causality, weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (Elara, the workshop, the floating platform) and builds through iterative ritual toward the single unbroken circle, which triggers the bell's ringing. That final image—gold light ripple, stilled acid sea, ringing stars—registers as Conceptual Repricing: the universe "leaning in" reweights the premise of an unheard bell. However, the cost is implied rather than viscerally legible; no specific option or resource is foreclosed on the page, and the escalation reads more as accumulation of texture than a tightening that narrows tactics. The kaleidoscope-to-resonator sequence provides causality within the ritual frame, but the "months bled into a tapestry" elision skips the friction that would make the final breakthrough feel harder-won.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative layering. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara encrypts Psi, wipes logs, files a false report, and accepts guardianship as her calling; the cost is visible (she lies to authority, forecloses disclosure) and the final image recharges the patch and the archive motif. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by line 26 (who, where, stakes). One pressure tightening occurs when Vance orders closure and Elara defies protocol, narrowing her options and raising stakes. Minor causality smoothness: the deprecated terminal's discovery feels convenient ("she'd discovered during system migrations") rather than earned through prior scene work, softening the escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes orientation (lighthouse orchard, peacekeeper, crystal fragment) within acceptable bounds and pursues a clear goal: reconstitute the vision to save the orchard. However, the causal chain feels illustrative rather than pressured—each mirror glimpse arrives as scheduled revelation without resistance or cost, and the final restoration unfolds through assertion ("channeled the emotional resonance") rather than dramatized struggle. The closure image (blossoming orchard, serene ice) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no specific forfeiture or trade-off is made legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (gathering fragmented truths toward synthesis), yet the synthesis itself lacks the felt friction that would make the reconfiguration undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through recurring motifs (parasol tip, ice groan, folding) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara will keep her appointment but tonight sits with the community, crystallizing options with felt cost. Orientation anchors appear by line 2 (Arctic marina, bunkhouse). One pressure tightening occurs when the net surfaces with the journal, shifting her motivation from ending's sound to survival's symphony. Cost is felt but oblique—the final image charges the parasol tip with "dawn's promise" yet the immediate consequence of her choice (appointment tomorrow) remains ambiguous, weakening the before/after legibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens: Elara guides the couple toward stance crystallization. Orientation is clear early (vineyard sentinel, amber pavilion, post-bus departure). However, closure lacks on-page cost; Clara and Liam's reconciliation is verbalized intent ("rebuilding trust syllable by syllable") rather than a decisive action or refusal that forecloses a path. The final image shows Elara's satisfaction but no visible price paid—no option narrowed, no trade-off made legible in the ending beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered description and ritual cadence rather than causal turns. Orientation is delayed—"half-masked line walker" and "murmuring pavilion" are named but not anchored spatially or temporally until after the opening paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael completes the ritual and walks away, trusting the clearing to hold; the cost is oblique—he does not look back—but the final image of patience and release is legible. The lens holds, though causality is loose and the cost is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates community healing beats across weeks, but the closure—Elara watching children chase fireflies, her work "complete"—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration without a sharp felt cost on the page. The mosaic structure (multiple vignettes across time) is legible, but no single beat meaningfully tightens or deepens pressure; each Tuesday session is paraphrase of the prior. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The ending reweights the premise from archivist-in-progress to archivist-complete, yet the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than a visible forfeiture or stake-shift that lands in a specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is inferred and held: fragments → pattern recognition → restoration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (restoration-as-testimony) with a felt cost (leaving the sanctuary, stepping into dawn). Orientation is clear early (library, dawn, post-dictionary era). One meaningful deepening occurs when the crystal shifts from human echoes to elemental sounds, reweighting his search. The cost of thirty years and departure is legible but quietly stated rather than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist-forms, chalk symbols, and sensory echoes build density toward the moment the fog coalesces into the rocking chair. That moment offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sound she sought is "made audible"), but the cost is ambient rather than sharp—"the memory of her grandfather slipped away" restates her condition without a new forfeiture. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sound arrives, yet the closing vow to "return at dawn" cycles back to the opening ritual without narrowing options or changing knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The earthquake → spinning hand → leaf observation → recalibration sequence accumulates pressure and the final image reweights "escape velocity" from literal physics to yielding stillness, a clear conceptual cost (renouncing force for grace). Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The cost is legible in the final reframing, though the causality from leaf-sound to solution reads slightly convenient—the leap from "tap" to "mechanism needs release" compresses insight without visible trial-and-error that would show Elara earning the epiphany through failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (hospice room, post-blood-work, Arthur dying, Lena grieving). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: Elara's song weaves memory and sensory detail (vinyl shard, lavender scent) to reweight grief into connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the broken shard becomes "wholehearted emblem"), yet cost remains elusive—no tactic was altered, no option foreclosed; the family simply shifts from mourning to remembering without visible sacrifice or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: corrupted runes → relearned symbols → corrected glyph → orrery completion → sealed awakening revealed. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, post-Spoon-Bending) arrive early. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where shadows are revealed as sheltered rather than destroyed—lands on the page with conceptual cost (three seasons consumed, a "frayed thread" mended). One weakness: the orrery's resistance is telegraphed ("She had anticipated this resistance") rather than dramatized as a live surprise, slightly flattening the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara reflects on the tooth, recalls Lyra's illness, and resolves to transform the garden into a teaching space. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she walks toward the hedge maze with a new purpose. However, the discovery itself (the cleft proves Lyra wasn't replaced) happens off-stage in memory; the tooth was found three winters ago, so the narrative tension is retrospective rather than present-scene pressure. The cost is conceptual (letting go of the changeling narrative) but not viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the stakes remain largely internal and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: memory and craft deepen the object's meaning until the final image reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sea glass becomes a "promise" and the act of giving will "touch the heavens"), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara forfeiting an option or paying a visible price. The "pearl of stillness" metaphor recurs, yet the ending restates theme rather than showing a decisive shift in Elara's world.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The icicle pattern guides the ritual act, creating a single meaningful tightening when Elara places the pendant. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via ritual renunciation), but cost remains oblique—the pendant's loss is more symbolic than a felt forfeiture that alters options. Orientation is clear early. The lens holds, but the final image ("honeyed hush followed her") abstracts rather than charges with undeniable pressure. One distinct deepening suffices at this length, yet the ending reads as thematic summary more than on-page reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is deferred: "who" (Elias) appears only at paragraph 7, and the nexus remains abstract mist without spatial anchors past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—placing the shell on the stone and declaring the novel "ready to be shared"—arrives on the page but carries no visible cost: he has not forfeited publisher approval, abandoned a draft, or lost anything tangible. The "conflict within him settled" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or renunciation that forecloses a live option. Under an Accumulative lens (the piece layers cameos), the ending does not reweight prior pressure; it simply stops collecting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (grove, Elara, dawn/harvest moon alignment). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: the songs are restored and the grove responds, but the cost is invisible—Elara simply places the tendril back and walks away with "certainty," no path foreclosed, no palpable price paid. The lens reads Causal (ritual mechanics drive the sequence) but the final image lacks felt or conceptual cost; the transformation is wish-fulfillment without sacrifice. Under the cost-proof test, I cannot point to an on-page sentence showing what Elara lost or gave up, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early; no penalty applied. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual accumulates components (pattern, plate, blood, starlight) toward a final density shift. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the paper transforms, a bud swells), but the felt cost is oblique—Elara's "unburdened" spirit contradicts the requirement for visible cost or foreclosure. The "aching joints" gesture is insufficient to establish a meaningful price paid or path closed. The lens holds, but closure lacks the undeniable pressure or trade-off required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: dawn → mid-morning → noon → dusk observations build density and shift the beam angles, culminating in the echo harvest. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Kael succeeds without forfeiting anything on the page, and the final image (echoes safe, heart stocked) asserts resonance rather than dramatizing a reweighting with felt price. The Resonant Reconfiguration (if intended) reads as declared wonder rather than pressure-charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered atmosphere and weaving process build toward calcification). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elara honors her vow, maintains flexible compassion, and steps outside into renewal), but the cost is conceptual—stated in reflection ("refusing to calcify into cold detachment") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible price on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the anxiety calcifies, yet the scene reads more as ritual completion than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph layers memory, sensory detail, and metaphor toward the final image of "actively, purposefully harvesting." Orientation is clear by the opening lines (Elara, loft, present carving ritual). The kettle's whistle functions as a micro turn that shifts from carving to tea, and the closing lines reweight "loss" as "harvest" with felt emotional cost. However, the cost is asserted through summary ("loss had been her harshest teacher") rather than dramatized on the page, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed by the ending choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accumulate until the ghost integration delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reconciliation as Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (kinetic lagoon, carousel, Elara). The closure unit—ghost integration and self-acceptance—lands on the page with felt cost (decades of separation dissolved, compromise reweighted as foundation rather than failure). One meaningful deepening occurs when collected fragments reframe her own story. The cost is legible: she must release the binary of success/failure and honor erosion as essential.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs and maintains a single continuous scene with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the shimmering constellation on the dome reweights the abandoned terminal's meaning through redirected flow. The causal chain—discovery of sextant fragment → measurement → channel clearing → water flow → light refraction—holds under a Causal lens with ellipsis that feels motivated. Cost is legible in the labor ("stone by stone," "rusted bolts") and the quiet pulse of renewed purpose forecloses pure abandonment. One meaningful tightening (hesitant trickle to constellation) is sufficient for this length. However, the closure image tilts slightly toward authored metaphor rather than stark dramatization, and the equation articulation in the penultimate beats borders on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara accepts the transplanted dream by leaving the fork, forecloses the path of regret, and walks toward a reweighted future. Cost is visible (abandoning the original symphony, twenty years of sorrow) and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural—petrichor, crystal whispers, glacial hush all deepen until the final cadence shift. One minor causality stretch: the crystal "recognizing" her unwritten symphony feels convenient, though anchored in the fork's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, twilight barge, canal) arrive promptly and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara's hindsight clarity deepens through a series of reflective beats (scent of paper, Thorne's darting eyes, coordinates reveal) that reweight her understanding and culminate in a renunciation of vengeance. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses documentation over revenge, forecloses the revenge path, and adopts a new identity as "guardian of authenticity." However, the cost is largely asserted ("hard-won wisdom," "serene upheaval") rather than dramatized; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price visceral at the ending beat. The sundial discovery and coordinate realization are told in summary, which flattens the turn's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through fog, knot-reading, and discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elara accepts the method as treasure, not the seed). Orientation anchors (golden dock, fog, harbor) arrive early. The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost legible in "the fulgurite a warm weight… a promise," reweighting the premise from object-retrieval to stewardship continuity. One persistent constraint (the secret weavers' encoded knowledge) shapes tactics. Minor tension: the fisherman's arrival feels coincidental rather than causally motivated, and the final paragraphs risk drifting into summary rather than charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words) and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's understanding that absence can be "cultivated ground." However, the closure arrives via exposition and Kael's explanation rather than a dramatized turn. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increase toward a thematic reweighting—but the final journal-writing beat summarizes rather than dramatizes cost. Cost is implied (Elara now "entrusted" rather than "stranded") but not visibly paid on the page in a concrete choice or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "when" remains deliberately vague. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual assembles conditions, the light-bird manifests, dissolves, and leaves the feather—a pattern break that reweights beauty from restoration to memory. Closure is Conceptual Repricing (flawed genesis becomes seed for new creation), and the cost is legible: the Lark cannot return physically. However, the causal chain compresses thirty years into a single night's result without on-page struggle, weakening the because/therefore linkage that would sharpen the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual accumulates symbolic weight through layered objects (black sand, coin, thread, kelp) and reaches closure via Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's internal acceptance that "scars can sing" crystallizes in the final image of the kelp graft holding fast. The orientation anchors (Elara, dune/lagoon, ritual time) arrive clearly. However, the closure cost is felt emotionally but not dramatized through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off on the page; the sunbeam igniting the thread reads as affirming grace rather than earned tension. One meaningful deepening occurs (the father's memory sharpens her vow) but no reversal or tightening narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story layers breadcrumbs and fountain visits toward a pattern-break climax. Orientation anchors arrive early (city, fountains, box, geese). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box opens, memories flow, fountains awaken—a cadence shift that reweights the city's state with visible transformation. Cost is primarily conceptual (the city's sorrow released) rather than personal loss, and the final image charges prior motifs (geese, constellations, water). One meaningful deepening occurs when the aligned elements converge. Lens holds; closure lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early and follows an accumulative lens: sonar pings map the garden, ancestral echoes layer meaning, and the final master ping delivers nurturing dawn. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the cycle sustained, peace found in repetition), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatically visible—no prior error or sacrifice charges the ending image. The "troubling serenity" and "acceptance" are told; the gear's final warmth and the daughter's future are conceptual rather than felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (sapphire to emerald light, garden bloom), satisfying the accumulative standard, but the ending drifts into summary ("she knew she would walk this path again") instead of landing a decisive final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (monarchs, ribbons, poems) toward a thematic reweighting. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara discovers the memorial's form and carries it forward as "compass forged from memory," a stance crystallization with felt purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (greenhouse, dusk, carver), and the arc tightens through retracing memory to present realization. Cost is implied (the weight of 37 lives, the sacred work ahead) but not sharply dramatized as a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, and when anchor by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through sensory layering and the rake-handle inscriptions, culminating in the pendulum's pause and the reverie. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara emerges "centered, spirit fused with ancestral purpose" and the clock's restored tick reweights the opening silence with felt communal cost. The causal linkage is light (the reverie is mystically triggered rather than earned through prior micro-choices), and the final inscription "Cleared the grit. Honored the silence. Swung true." reads as summary rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options. The reconfiguration is legible and the ending image of the gull tracing the pendulum's arc charges prior material, but the cost remains largely conceptual and social rather than viscerally personal to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (uncharted echoes accrue meaning through each thread). Orientation anchors who and where adequately, though "after the chess clock runs down" remains vague. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the spiral pattern, but cost is asserted ("the community's confusion now woven into a narrative") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or stance shift on the page. The sequence is more illustrative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural attempted but unearned. Orientation is anchored early (spire, lake, Elara). The closure unit is Charged Poise—hand poised above vellum, certainty crystallized—but no on-page cost is legible: no resource spent, no option foreclosed, no felt price in the final image. The "sustaining transformation had already begun" is asserted, not demonstrated. Three moons of preparation are summarized; the single on-page beat (doubt → certainty) lacks causal tightening because the data review simply reassures her without altering tactics or revealing new stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through a sustained density increase that reweights the dominant stake (preserving forbidden stories). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes Elara's role shift from copyist to "gardener of ghosts" with undeniable conceptual pressure, though the emotional cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the broadcast fades and she inscribes the harvest, reconfiguring her task from preservation to invitation. The causality is minimal (receive → transcribe → plan future action) but sufficient under an accumulative design; the closure unit lands cleanly without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test is satisfied early (gallery, Elara, rocking chair), but no causal linkage drives the sequence: Elara prepares materials, draws, scatters powder, and the chair stops—each beat is presented as ritualistic inevitability rather than because/therefore pressure. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the mirage of safety transformed through acknowledgment), yet the cost is asserted ("threshold crossed") rather than dramatized; I cannot point to an exact sentence where Elara forfeits an option or pays a felt price. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern does not tighten or break—events accumulate without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure operates as Earned Stasis—Kael's decision to preserve rather than proclaim forecloses the revolutionary path with on-page cost (ten years of work risked, the weight of silence accepted). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 25 (who/where/when). The tablet discovery deepens pressure and the sedimentary method recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. One meaningful tightening (the agonize/decide sequence) narrows options under an accumulative lens, and the cog's return in the final third charges the ending image with precision-as-promise.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation early (library, autumn, choir rehearsal) and establishes a dominant stake: can the choir transcend old hatreds? The "weeks passed" summary compresses the core escalation, so the tightening effect is asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Liam–Anya exchange reweights prior tension), but the cost is conceptual and muted—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of subtraction + final cadence shift), yet the ending reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt price that would anchor it firmly in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Arlo prunes → memories released → seed planted with accumulated emotion → tree emerges. Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, celestial event). The closure is on-page (seedling reaches for light, Arlo tastes promise), but the cost remains oblique—he walks away "lighter," which reads as relief rather than visible forfeiture. The pruning-to-planting sequence is motivated, yet the celestial alignment functions as convenient timing rather than a constraint that narrows his options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (riddle-reveal structure builds through nectar-dusk imagery and the lacquer-box nested objects). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blackout reweights from "software fault" to "beauty-blinded sensors," framed through the riddle's answer. However, cost is asserted ("renewed purpose," "changed heart") rather than shown in a forfeited option or visible trade-off. Orientation anchors early (tower, Kael, blackout timeframe). The nested-box sequence provides cadence, but the turn—Dr. Aris's epiphany—arrives via explanation, not a choice that narrows Kael's path.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the orris root placement, the hush descends, and Elara's perception deepens to see the cottage's displaced objects as sacred archive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding that "aliveness was not in the structure, but in the love displaced and placed") with conceptual cost felt in the shift from search to witness. However, the cost is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture of a prior path or tactic. The single beat (kneeling, placing shard, perceiving archive) constitutes the one meaningful deepening required at this length, but the "instantly" transition and the catalogue of objects (sea-glass, crayon drawing, jay's feather) arrive as exposition rather than discoveries that narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece presents a cascade of four revelations delivered sequentially without causal linkage or protagonist agency shaping their order or cost. Each revelation is told as exposition ("the first revelation cascaded," "a second revelation followed") rather than dramatized through Kael's choices narrowing options. The ending offers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost; the garden "breathes anew" and Kael "stood vigil" without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. Orientation anchors who and where early, but the drive lens remains unclear—neither causal choices nor accumulative deepening with cost crystallizes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repetitive climbing, proof-etching, and dice-rolling build density toward the rupture climax. The rupture offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the texture floods in, she absorbs it, and the staircase transforms from prison to sanctuary with visible emotional cost ("despair had dissolved into purpose"). Orientation is clear early. The closure lands on the page, though the cost reads more emotional than material, and the final third's abstract phrasing ("Each equation was a tribute") slightly dilutes the concrete charge of the rupture moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the daydream memory at line 119, the painting ritual, placement, and the nurse's addition form a pattern that reweights the "lost languages" stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the nurse's note and wildflower crystallize the kindness lexicon with felt cost—Elara's tears and the shift from void to vigil. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, what by line 58). One minor slip: the daydream sequence (lines 119–135) recounts rather than dramatizes the bus-stop memory, reducing immediacy at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The story follows a causal arc: Elara examines carvings → discovers silver-leaf detail → corrects community's misbelief → baking resumes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (community reclaims the art with adaptation), and the cost is legible—the beekeeper's absence is accepted, displacement's ache is honored through bitterness of the herb. However, the escalation is thin: once Elara identifies the herb, resistance evaporates and the community mobilizes without friction or secondary complication. The final image ("culture is a seed, not a relic") delivers thematic weight but borders on direct statement rather than non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when promptly and maintains a clear Causal lens: disengaging the clutch → inserting the yoyo mechanism → counter-clockwise rotation → light transformation → hunger stone glow. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the counter-clockwise sweep now asks "what if time flows both ways?" and Elara accepts the role of tending this new chronology. The cost is conceptual—she has not erased suffering but overlaid it with possibility—and the final image makes that trade legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the beam ignites and rewrites the stone's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: advisor seeks weakness → uses paradox → fear confesses → curse lifts. Orientation arrives cleanly in the opening beat. The closure is a Decisive Change (void heals, clasp fades) with conceptual cost legible in the final image, but the fear-thing's capitulation hinges on dialogue rather than on-page pressure that narrows options. The "truly seen" confession feels convenient—introduced late without prior groundwork that this specific weakness existed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual beats (sketch, dub, sketch, dub) toward a final transformation, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration when the storm "convinced to sing" reweights the opening threat. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the storm's energy channeled, not defeated). However, the escalation reads as additive description rather than narrowing options or raising felt stakes; each dub simply layers another note without friction or trade-off, weakening the tightening requirement for the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly (city, gate, protagonist) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: years of pattern-mapping cohere into the whistle note that transforms rust into luminescence—a meaningful deepening with felt cost (tears, acknowledgment of lost voices). Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: Elara steps across the threshold toward the Watchers, reconfiguring her role from survivor to question itself, with cost visible in the transmuted dread she carries forward. Causality holds under this lens; the single tightening (alignment → note → transformation) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is present early (historian, station, letter), and the dominant stake—rescuing truth—is signaled. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs: Aris arrives with the letter, recites parallels aloud to himself, and declares success without on-page opposition, discovery, or cost that alters his options. The closure unit is a series of assertions ("truth now took root," "recapture was restoration") rather than a dramatized decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible price. The cost is claimed in summary ("bittersweet passing of a comforting myth") but never felt or tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers inscriptions and images toward a tonal deepening rather than causal escalation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elias completes his ritual and walks away—but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than legible on the page in a specific sentence or image. The drawbridge's metallic clang signals time pressure, yet no tactic shifts or trade-off crystallizes in response; the ending recapitulates the opening stance without a felt pivot or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory detail and archival clues toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. Closure occurs on-page: Elara stamps both the hidden sigil and the margin, creating a "permanent testament" that honors silenced truth—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). However, the cost remains abstract; the "chest tight with quiet victory" and the claim that "the truth was now anchored" assert stakes rather than dramatizing a forfeited path or visible price. The accumulation of clues is coherent, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—the library "no longer forgotten" reads as thematic claim rather than a concrete shift in Elara's options or the world's state.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph: Elara, floating island tea garden, post-shadow detachment. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: polishing → basilica ritual → dream recording → origami folding builds density and culminates in a pattern break (the tear of acknowledgment rather than despair). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the grief-folding ritual with renewed purpose and undeniable emotional pressure. Cost is legible in "the grief would be folded again" and the recognition that torment remains but now has bearable shape. The lens holds, though the accumulation could tighten with fewer mid-story abstractions to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, floating observatory, grief-driven hunt) land by the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the perturbation ritual, the vision of the pool, and the power-surge interruption, then closes on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara pockets the geode and commits to "begin again," reweighting her survival from crater to canvas. Cost is felt ("bleak exhilaration," tears, trembling legs) but oblique—no on-page forfeiture of a live option. The circuit-breaker timeframe provides a ticking constraint that ends the trance but does not force a trade-off choice. Under the accumulative lens, the final cadence shift and image ("potential pools… in the courage to begin again") reconfigure meaning with visible emotional cost, meeting the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain (drone → flagstone → chip → orrery activation → belonging) is clear and the ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (connection as constant). However, the final cost is felt rather than visible: no option is materially foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The orientation is prompt (observatory, dusk, drone mission) and the lens is causal-dominant with an RR ending. The closure satisfies the definition but lacks the sharp, on-page tradeoff that would lift it into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shore ritual and watch-hand discovery deepen the stake through density and image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the vow to speak truth and the resolved stance are legible—but the cost remains prospective ("heavier, holier weight of honesty") rather than paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the carving surfaces and reframes the guilt, satisfying the length requirement, though the final beat summarizes intention rather than enacting decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise)—the drawer pull shifts from burden to symbol of resolve, and the neutral territory becomes a threshold crossed; the final image reweights prior material with felt cost (the "lighter, steadier burden"). The orientation is clear (who, where, when anchored early), and the exchange itself provides one meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in the loosening of invisible chains and the shift from apology to fragile trust. One persistent constraint (moon-phase synchronization) shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Arlo shifts from terrestrial-only navigation to integrating stars, a stance crystallization with felt cost (accepting scarred competence). The drive lens reads Causal with a single meaningful tightening at Widow's Point where poles end and force the turn. Orientation is swift (gravel launch, dawn, kayak, coastal setting by line 1). One concern: the compass "had never been broken" pivot feels slightly under-motivated—his five-year mistrust dissolves in one glance at Venus without sufficient on-page friction or cost in that exact moment, though the overall arc earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the timeframe "after the procedure" is implicit throughout. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments (newspapers, moss spelling "E.R.") layer toward the bioluminescent lake, where the baseball's glow harmonizes with the ecosystem to trigger the empathy integration. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the placement of the baseball and the surge of light reweight the dominant stake with felt warmth and integration. However, cost legibility is soft: Kael "carries the lake's gentle luminescence within him" without visible forfeiture or trade-off; the baseball remains on the water, but what path this forecloses or what price he pays for the transformation is asserted more than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs (decoding → descent → lake revelation), sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens, though the causal through-line from newspaper clues to lake discovery relies on convenient symbol-matching rather than motivated problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritual preparation moves accumulate density (spices, gathered beasts, mist, metamorphosis) toward a closure that reweights the premise—Elara becomes the orchard, bond reforged as cosmic presence. Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, orchard, post-phoenix moonlight). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into saplings), and cost is visible (surrender of mortal form, voice now "the orchard itself"). However, the escalation is smooth accretion without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options; the ritual proceeds as foretold without complication, and the final image, while poetic, does not reweight prior material sharply—it confirms the fortune's promise rather than charging it with surprise or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (onyx-ink cartomancer, midnight glade, post-birth timeframe). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery (cracked saucer, locket tracing, starlight-drinking ink) and the final paragraph attempts Resonant Reconfiguration by reweighting the crack as vessel rather than void. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara descends with "heart unfastened from fear" but no on-page forfeiture or trade-off that makes a before/after legible with pressure. The ritual structure (ascent, kneel, vision, descend) provides coherence, but causality is weak: the saucer crack "appeared...at the exact second of Lyra's first cry" as oracle rather than earned consequence, and the epiphany blooms from passive vision rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through repeated stitching beats and memory fragments, building toward the dimensional unlock. Orientation is clean (ship, memory sanctum, Elara alone), and the closure image (stepping through threshold, "hope breathed again") offers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt release. However, cost at closure is diffuse—her tears of release feel cathartic rather than foreclosing a path, and no prior tactical option is visibly surrendered. The stitching ritual deepens but does not meaningfully tighten or narrow her choices; she floats higher with each memory, a one-directional ascent without reversal or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (volcano, sand, celestial alignment, bugs) toward a final cadence shift. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the release moment and volcano's hum), but the cost is asserted ("bittersweet joy," "lightness of release") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture that alters her options. Orientation anchors (black sand beach, volcano, Elara) arrive early and remain stable. The prophecy fulfillment lands but feels convenient rather than earned by Elara's prior choices, weakening causal pressure even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Kael engineers the blackout, uses it to access the sundial mechanism, signals the network, and resumes his post with the revolution sparked. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the network is awake, the first spark delivered, and Kael's role shifts from jailer to midwife with the cost felt in the transformed silence. The lens is Causal with Accumulative textures; linkage holds and the ending reweights the opening darkness with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Charged Poise: the restored friction circle and eel response reweights her understanding of sacred patterns, shifting from domination to invitation). The closure lands with conceptual cost (dimmed aurora, lighter pouch) and reconfigures her stance. However, the escalation is modest—placing stones and chanting does not encounter meaningful resistance or complication; the vision of failure is raised then immediately dismissed. The transformation from eel herder to pattern keeper feels thematically neat rather than forged through dramatized friction, and the cost (aurora dims, pouch lighter) is told rather than tested in a subsequent choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is late—who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of atmospheric description, though the pattern pays off at closure (−0.3 applied, Q3 capped at 7.0). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: storm imagery, darkroom metaphor, and scar cartography accumulate and reweight at the ending. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (vigil transforms from pause to purpose), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or trade-off anchors the shift. The letter acts as catalyst, but its mechanics (sealed decades ago by a vanished mentor) arrive late and resolve tension it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines and maintains spatial coherence. However, closure relies on decoding a message rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost; the "hidden overture" arrives as information, not a turn that transforms stakes. The accumulative lens is signaled through repeated motifs (sundial, brook, needles) but the final image—Elara ready to collaborate—reconfigures meaning only conceptually, with the cost of waiting and decryption implied rather than dramatized. The because/therefore chain is present but the ending substitutes declarative summary ("knowing the most profound destinations...") for an image that charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (rusted library, prison flashback, courtyard stones, seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts transformation as method rather than betrayal. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—the dissolution of Silas and embrace of perpetual change. The prison-library flashback anchors present stakes cleanly. One tightening occurs when Kael's "luminous fracture" metaphor reweights Elara's fear into acceptance, narrowing her stance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure—clock hands moving from 3:17 to 3:18—lands on the page and offers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (one minute restored, not full resurrection). However, the journey to the arbor proceeds through convenience: the film-reel cipher is explained rather than discovered through friction, and the projector/ritual sequence lacks causality testing (no false starts, no price for entry). The lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid, but the middle escalation ("flickering compasses" guide without real wrong turns) weakens the because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and follows an accumulative lens: dream interpretation → planting → sensory flood → expanded role. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (her role expands from verifier to guardian), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page choice or renunciation that visibly forecloses an option. The monsoon arrives and the memory endures, but the final paragraphs summarize her transformation and future intentions instead of landing a single charged image or action that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the compass ritual gathers memory into a chromatic revelation—and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when cerulean regret reweights guilt into acceptance. However, the cost is conceptual and felt rather than a visible forfeiture; the protagonist's path forward is emotionally lighter but no on-page option is foreclosed with a legible price, preventing entry to the high band.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of decay) with cost legible in "The needless drama he sought to strip was his own frantic need to control meaning." Orientation is clear early, and the pattern of daily returns tightens toward the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Orientation is immediate and vivid. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her resolve to transform the ledger reconfigures her from victim to "vessel of transformed truth," with the cost of her burned studio and trauma felt. The frost pattern as a map provides a clean, non-causal linkage that deepens meaning. A minor hairline slip: the causal chain of the attack (Kael's commission to the violence) is recounted in summary, but this does not harm the accumulative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes canvas. The cost is legible in Liam's tear and relaxed breath. The inferred Hybrid lens (causal chain leading to accumulative resonance) holds without contradiction, and the winterglass constrains tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly from setup to closure. The package arrival shatters equilibrium; Elias's sequential placements accumulate into a resonant reconfiguration (the library's glow, stillness cherished). Cost is legible in the final image and the conceptual repricing of brokenness. Orientation is immediate, and the closure unit lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the deliberate, soft chime redefines the bell’s purpose and their covenant, with cost felt in the forsaken loud celebration. Orientation is immediate; structure builds through patterned shards (runs, returns) that cohere into a single, legible closure unit at the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: density of sensory and breath-driven beats escalates to a Conceptual Repricing where unused love is reweighted from debt to potential. Closure lands on-page with cost ("the hollow space within now filled with quiet purpose") and the viaduct as altar. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.

    Causal lens holds tightly: because of the neural procedure and his desire for empathy, Kael decodes newspaper clues to navigate the labyrinth, leading to the bioluminescent lake climax. Closure is a decisive change (empathy kindled) with felt cost integrated into the final image ("Tears washed the numbness from his face"). Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no elision or ambiguity. The baseball as a persistent constraint shapes tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost; accumulative lens holds; orientation clear early; the constraint of surrendering her gift shapes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds tightly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (lost time accumulates in fractures) with felt cost ("melting the icy knot of anxiety"). Orientation is immediate, and the cracked saucer persistently shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.6)
    Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (focusing on tears, recalling memories, stitching) advances via because/therefore linkage toward the dimensional lock. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tears of release) and a persistent constraint (shadow-work integration) shapes the final image. Orientation is immediate and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration and visible cost (giving her only treasure); the accumulative lens holds, orientation is anchored early, and the prophecy adds irony without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands decisively with the network awakened and Kael reconfigured as a "midwife to hope," a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost in the risk undertaken. The causal lens holds tightly: the blackout enables the sundial signal, which triggers the answering pulse and transforms the silence. Orientation is immediate and clear; the taught pattern of shadow-as-ink pays off at the ending. The persistent constraint of the blackout shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with on-page cost (aurora dimmed, star dust spent). Orientation is swift and clear. The promise and pattern build density that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: "the aurora dimmed where energy was drawn; her pouch of star dust felt lighter."

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she moves from pause to purpose. Cost is legible in her shattered composure and the timer's chime. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the letter discovery tightens stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost (vulnerability) and the inferred Hybrid lens holds; the sundial and needle card constrain tactics, and orientation is anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reconceives her transformation as integral to resistance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to the seed-planting act. Cost is legible in her tears and release. Orientation is clear and early.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain from grief to encoded film to arbor ritual is tight; closure with the clock's minute restored provides a decisive change with emotional cost, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is decisive with the memory awakening and her role expansion; cost is legible in her doubt and the act of planting; causal lens holds from motivation to outcome without breaks, and the ridge's transformation charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Elias's tears. Orientation is clear early, and the lace method shapes tactics persistently.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens and sustains it: repeated visits, slight environmental changes, and reflections gradually reweight the central stake. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when are immediately legible), and the temporal structure—successive mornings—remains coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Aris’s stance toward decay and his own methods is distinctly different by the end, with the decision to repair the roof and return as “student” marking the turn. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, but it is visible: he relinquishes his prized mental habit as the primary tool for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: Kael’s commission → ledger in her possession → attack on the studio → flight to the canyon → reflection and choice about the ledger. The structure is essentially one aftermath scene interwoven with a flashback, with the frost pattern functioning as an organizing device for memory and realization. Closure is solid: she makes a decisive, irreversible choice (preserve and reveal rather than destroy or hide) that reconfigures the meaning of the attack and the ledger at a conceptual cost. Pressure is mostly internal and reflective, but the through-line is legible and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense sanctuary, method established, then the intrusion of Liam and a healing ritual that culminates in a new shared stance. Causality is sound (trauma → retreat → invention of method → encounter → application of method to shared pain), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where connection replaces isolating silence. There’s no orientation debt; the conservatory and stakes are legible very early. The only mild weakness is that the final conceptual summing-up is more told than dramatized, softening the impact of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: stable routine → disruptive package → experimentation with the shards → cumulative restoration → reconfigured stasis at the end. Causality is easy to track (lens arrives; he chooses to repurpose it; each shard restores a voice; the mosaic beacon completes his life’s work), and the drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the library shifts from mausoleum to luminous archive, and Elias’s role evolves from mere preserver of silence to deliverer of rest. The main constraint is that costs and obstacles remain conceptual and gentle, so the sense of structural “price” is present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: anonymous donations → ritualized runs → tonight’s incident on the slope → bell ceremony and covenant. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, with the slope moment as the clear pivot that justifies Elara reweighting the bell’s meaning. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the single note and spoken covenant mark a before/after in how the community conceives its unity. The cost is subtle but legible in the risk of sound and the renunciation of the bell’s old uses in favor of this one, sacred note.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sparks → viaduct → camera → breath-induced revelations → conceptual revaluation of “unused love,” all within one continuous scene. Causality is internally consistent under a lyric-mystical logic—each breathing choice deepens the vision and leads directly to the heart-reservoir discovery and release. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: she re-understands unused love and her role as artist-healer, with a before/after that’s legible and satisfying. The cost (relinquishing a long-held narrative of regret) is present but conveyed more in statement than dramatized struggle, which keeps this just below a top-tier structural score.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the ritual at the nexus, activation of the fragment, and release of the trapped moment build toward a clear reconfiguration of Elara’s relationship with time. Causality within the magical logic is coherent (maze as hyperbolic geometry → method to release the “frozen moment” → change in how time behaves for her). Closure is strong: the photographs stabilizing and her decision to “dance with time, not trapped by it” mark a decisive before/after with emotional cost. There are no significant orientation issues, though the shift from scientific-sounding “hyperbolic geometry” to quasi-mystical incantation is taken on faith rather than worked through tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: the ticking demolition deadline pressures Elara, her decoding of the keys reveals the mechanism, and opening the vault halts the bulldozer and reconfigures everyone’s options. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change—demolition stops, the vault is now public, the foreman’s stance shifts—plus a resonant internal reframing of her chains. The main structural weakness is how easily the external obstacle yields; we never see a serious possibility that the crew will proceed despite the revelation. Still, the throughline holds under a causal lens and the before/after is legible with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: collecting absences → approaching the forge → imprinting the fracture → revaluing wreckage and silence. Causality is clean under a textural lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the captured break becomes a “compass toward authenticity” with an emotional cost marked by the tear and revisited memory. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is legible early and held through to the conceptual repricing at the end. The main constraint is that external obstacles never test the ritual itself, keeping the plot’s pressure more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a tight single-scene structure: arrive with a goal, decode the arrangement, experience a reweighted message, then make a different life-choice as a result. Causality is clear—uncorking the jar shifts what she can see, which alters the code, which in turn alters her options and her stance toward destiny. Closure is strong: she explicitly refuses the train and steps into the forest, giving a decisive before/after with a visible opportunity cost. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric surface and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: one continuous scene whose beats follow a clear because/therefore chain—arrival → work → fracture → abandonment → new piece → dome/bookmark closure. The drive is Hybrid (causal plus accumulative/textural), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the flawed vessel is sacrificed, the bookmark is re-seen under glass, and “abandonment” is conceptually repriced. Cost is on-page in the relinquished piece and the relinquished self-conception of perfectionism. A slight sense of ease in the transition from despair to resolution keeps it just short of exceptional rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: revelation about Silas → flight to library → encounter with Lily → cast cipher and rust tears → journal/plan → modified shell → decoy escape. The global drive is causal, and closure lands: Elara changes tactics, outwits Silas, and reconfigures her identity and allegiance with visible cost. The main structural weakness is how easily Silas is diverted off-page; the climax resolves without a near-miss or complication that might better test her plan. Still, the scene holds together cleanly in one continuous window with a coherent, earned end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: she arrives after the storm, works within the lone-star window, completes the map, and descends with a reconfigured relationship to the night. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—she has translated the night’s silence into a stable artifact that will guide others. Causality is simple but intact; each mapping beat follows from her goal and the environment’s evolving hush. The main limitation is the relatively soft cost and low narrative jeopardy around whether she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: repeated loops, a clear anomaly (the violin), the decision to interact, and a synthesizing climax that reconfigures the temporal situation. Causality is sound—archives surface, prompting a new tactic, leading to amalgamation and the folding of timelines. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: the courtyard shifts from “temporal prison” to “sanctuary,” and the loops’ pedagogical purpose is understood. The cost (forty-three constrained iterations) is conceptually present but under-dramatized; we’re told more than we feel the weight of that confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: repeated ticket-reading builds toward the projection of Kael’s symbols and then to the communal gallery, with a clear before/after in the forecourt’s function. Causality is coherent—her nightly practice leads to discovering Kael, to the risky projection, to his response, and then to the community’s adoption. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the forecourt becomes a space of shared vulnerability, and Elara’s role is redefined. The main limitation is that the resolution unfolds very smoothly, with little resistance or complication once she acts.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clean causal throughline: present-tense tending and ritual, a charged interruption (Kael), a maze reaction, and a quiet but clear closure where Elara’s stance is affirmed. The backstory about the Great Frost is brief, well anchored, and reframes the marble ritual without derailing momentum. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Elara remains committed to her path, and the final emphasis on the garden “knowing her name” reweights luck vs. understanding. The only limit is that the external turn (maze trapping Kael) feels somewhat effortless for Elara, so the before/after shift in options is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: backstory and build-up feed directly into the present-tense experiment, lever-pull, revelation, and quiet aftermath. Causality is intact—device construction → alignment with nexus → activation → visible time lattice → zephyr response → changed stance—and there is clear closure via a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. The global drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a central causal spike at activation, and that pattern holds. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than situationally dire but is legible in Kael’s tears, trembling, and surrendered doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story uses a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: decoding the stains, testing the phrase, receiving the fermata, then repeating the phrase with new understanding before leaving. Causality is tight—each step (lantern flicker, emerging mark, Elias’s response) clearly follows from the prior choice or condition. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the opera house’s silence is reweighted from abandonment to “contented” connection, and Elias exits with altered stance and obligation. The cost is conceptual and emotional (disturbing a decades-long hush, accepting responsibility for the melody) rather than dramatic, which is effective but keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: fever breaks → heightened perception → encounter with log/smudge → memory of Kael → reconfiguration of her role and guilt. Causality is coherent and understated: the smudge precipitates the memory, which in turn recasts her past decision and present identity. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/CR—“I trust the margin now”—with clear cost in accepting her responsibility and relinquishing her previous ideal of perfection. The piece keeps a single continuous scene with an embedded flashback that is well cued and never disorients.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: confession → research into psychic calls → Eleanor’s detail → tunnel search → discovery → reinterpretation → resolve to speak, with no real orientation issues. The structure holds as a single continuous scene braided with reflection, and the closure—turning the wheel and deciding to carry the truth out—is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual repricing of the “ghost shift.” The major weakness is the slightly expository block that explains the pact of silence and foreman’s role in one compressed paragraph rather than letting more of that be inferred. Still, the ending image of walking toward dawn under a reweighted understanding lands strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—library → tremor and descent → refuge observation → return and re-seeing of the library—holds together cleanly under a textural drive lens. Each move follows causally (tremor → burrow → refuge → return) and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library is re-understood as evolving, not dying, with the chronicle entry as pivot. Stakes remain quiet and largely contemplative, but there is a clear before/after in her framed understanding. No orientation debt or lens confusion appears, though escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is structurally clean: a single continuous scene that moves causally from approach, to tentative engagement, to the eclipse-linked awakening. The dominant drive is hybrid (causal plus accumulative/textural), and the closure—Liam’s explicit recognition “The link is real” and his renewed curiosity—is legibly a Decisive Change on the page. The cost is subtle but present in Elara’s vulnerability and the weight she places on this small success, and the hair curl and eclipse pay off as seeded. Stakes are modest and outcomes feel somewhat pre-ordained, which limits structural tension but not basic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: present-moment attention to the tapestry and diaries deepens into the realization about the dual displaced axis and the reweighting of his curatorial work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when he reframes his role from preserving relics to “tending embers,” and the silence is “no longer lonely.” Causality is soft but coherent—each step (tapestry → diary → Elara’s last dream → his new understanding) naturally follows. The cost—the end of human dreaming, his solitary vigil—is legible and carried into the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: after "last orders" he stops the lamp, descends, crafts the prophetic cookie, arranges its delivery, waits, and Elara’s arrival/payoff resolves the drive toward reconciliation. The microdot plan and the history of accidentally prophetic fortunes set up the twist that the visible words alone summon her, which reconfigures his understanding of what actually works. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration with cost: twenty years of distance acknowledged and crossed through his on-page apology and her conditional acceptance. A slight convenience in her near-immediate arrival and readiness is noticeable but doesn’t break plausibility or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story has a clean causal throughline: dimensional anchor unraveling → Kael engages Elara’s assumptions via questions → she reclaims her buried colors → possession reverses and the anchor stabilizes. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single-scene structure holds without confusion. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus conceptual reconfiguration: Elara’s belief about safety-through-reduction is overturned and the anchor responds. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, but it is evident.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dawn ascent → mapping memories → mirrored horizon vision → post-ritual resolution form a coherent causal arc under a textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: homesickness is reweighted from wound to wellspring, and her future behavior (changed fortunes) is concretely implied. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the world’s mild fabulism is consistent. The only structural softness is that the “deadline” (exhaustion) never truly imperils completion, so pressure never quite tightens into crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: trapped in the interval between tear and impact, she uses the tablet to re-enter the labyrinth, faces specific memory-constructed trials, and finally re-enacts the primal drop with a new stance that fuses the timelines. The loop mechanic (“periodically eternal” with each tear) and the seventy-three prior failures provide a strong sense of accrued cost, and the final ripple reconfigures the world with clear before/after. Structure stays legible despite the metaphysical frame, with the viaduct as present-time anchor and the labyrinth as interior arena. The main limitation is that some steps in the psychological progression are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly smoothing what could be a rougher, more contested climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single continuous encounter where each step (arrival → offering the needle → modified phonograph → etched drum → tactile climax → departure) follows causally. The closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: Elara exits with a new tactile language of music, her relationship to silence fundamentally altered. Cost is legible in her confrontation with long-suppressed grief and the shattering of numbness. While the arc is relatively straightforward, it fits the accumulative/lyric drive and lands solidly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: followed home → sanctuary → anomaly with Nimbus → intercepted message and clay → inference about surveillance → counter-move via encrypted report → quiet, resolved stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses anchored resistance rather than panic or retreat, with a clear before/after. The cost (accepting heightened danger by escalating her leak) is present but mostly conceptual and could be made slightly more concrete. Structure is otherwise tight, single-scene, and coherent under a largely Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival → UV ritual → scent release → immersive memory → on-page reconfiguration at the inscription and post-ritual stance. Causality is straightforward and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, with no orientation debt and a clear before/after at closure. The closure (accepting tears and reorienting her work) lands with felt emotional cost and is rooted in prior beats. The main limitation is low external complication; everything functions as expected, so there’s little structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: sensory and historical layers build until the concrete dilemma of using or preserving the rope crystallizes. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—the choice not to descend, and the reframing of time as tapestry, marks a real before/after in his understanding with a legible opportunity cost. Causality is simple but coherent: perception of the spiral and fissure → recognition of the need for the rope → refusal and alternative gesture. The only restraint is that external stakes remain modest and the cost is almost entirely interior and conceptual, which slightly limits visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: each beat of preparation, memory, and music thickens the central pressure of the “chronic hush” until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the hush shifts from antagonist to companion and her relationship to the world is reweighted with an explicit cost (“She had not reversed the burning”). Causality is clean and legible—she journeys, prepares the space, uses the bowl, plays, and the hush’s meaning alters. The only limitation is that the structural turn is more contemplative than pressured; the outcome feels assured once she decides to play.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: inspection of the petal → detection of a “half truth” → realization of Elara’s real grief → ethical dilemma → subsumption and vow to change his work. Closure is a decisive internal change with cost—he chooses to feel genuine sorrow and alters his professional future—and it lands clearly on the page. Causality is coherent, with no orientation issues and no arbitrary rule changes. The conflict is modest in scale but structurally sound for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain—staying after the symphony → finding locket/envelope → meeting Liam → deciding on the anonymous note—reads cleanly and closes in a conceptual repricing of Elias’s life (“logistics of the soul”). The closure beat is on-page and legible, with a clear before/after in how he understands his work. Costs and constraints are mild, with no real resistance or complication beyond Elara’s ingrained invisibility. Still, for the length, the structure is tight and coherent under a mostly causal, slightly accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: solitary artist → meeting Kael → joint search → discovery of Echo’s tag → dedication and emotional shift. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens, with the pilgrimage logic paying off in the final ritual. Closure is clear and earned as Elara’s status shifts from seeker-outsider to woven-in member, with Kael’s solitude visibly ending. The main weakness is that the search itself involves little concrete difficulty or resistance, making the discovery feel somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: giant’s nap → Silent Pause → borrowed time → time-bubble journey → echo cage → key → release, with closure when the giant wakes and the world resumes altered. The global drive reads as causal with a single throughline scene, and the closure is a decisive change with conceptual repricing (echoes redefined, city reconfigured sonically). Still, the piece underplays concrete jeopardy or the possibility of failure—nothing in the structure truly threatens to break the quest once it begins. The cost is present (spent time, irreversible freeing of a primordial force) but could be made more sharply legible as a sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation of the ritual, enactment, vision, and a quiet but definite closure through conceptual repricing of loss. Causality within the lyric mode is intact—her choice to use the mosaic and eyes because of Kael leads directly to the vision and understanding—and there are no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she relinquishes the frame of “ambiguous disappearance” in favor of an immanent, less consolingly personal presence. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that pressure on the choice to perform this now, as opposed to any other time, remains a little soft.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: outage → Elara’s retrieval → placement by the mug → Evans’ discovery → mutual recognition → Elara stepping out of hiding. The piece reads under a Causal lens with a quiet but definite Decisive Change—Elara moves from deliberate invisibility to intentional visibility, and the before/after is legible. Closure has cost (she relinquishes the safety of anonymity) and lands on the page without explanatory padding. The structure is a single, coherent scene with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: post-storm inspection → leaf revelation → reconsideration of past behavior → new choices over subsequent days → closure in the final trellis scene. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each observation (leaf, moss, bent oak, new light) deepens the same internal question and culminates in a decisive stance shift. Closure is on-page and legible, with a before/after in how she meets storms and damage. The only limiter is that the middle “days later” montage is low-pressure, more illustrating the new mode than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: insomnia → storm/rain trails → pilgrimage → unearthed foundations → encounter → exchange → reconfigured relationship to sleep. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who/where/when locked in by the first two paragraphs), and the storm-exposed ravine provides a clear pivot from wandering to revelation. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: Elias relinquishes the brooch, receives the heartstone, and reconceives his insomnia before finally sleeping. The cost—releasing his long-held charge and yielding his vigil—is implicit but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: we move from problem (blind spot about the pilgrim) to ritual attempt to closure (reconfigured relationship to foresight and faith) in a single, coherent scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—the alignment of moons/shadows and focused intention leads to the activation of the pearl and the cavern’s transformation. Closure is strong: Elara’s stance toward her gift and the future is decisively altered, with a felt cost in relinquishing the comfort of certainty. The only slight limitation is that the ritual succeeds without any serious complication or turn beyond her internal letting-go, which keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: exile ends → vision from the valve → first note on the pier → sequence of curated revelations → Elder Lin’s reframing → the child’s drawing as charged future beat. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens; each act of restoration naturally leads to the next “interval” and deepens the central drive rather than feeling episodic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s role is redefined from archivist of a flawless past to steward of fragments—with the next fragment (the child’s drawing) clearly setting a before/after. There are no orientation or lens-ambiguity issues, and the scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: following crack-arrows → arrival at station → mythic dare → surrendering the map → the punch’s transformation → internal revaluation, with no orientation issues. Closure is solid: the decisive act (offering the vellum map) and the punched aperture reconfigure her understanding of the “fortress” with a legible emotional cost. The drive is largely accumulative/textural but underwritten by a simple causal spine, and the final before/after (avoiding vs acknowledging her own truths) is clear. A minor limitation is that most of the pressure is pre-loaded in exposition rather than tightened through multiple on-page complications.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative, lyric frame: discovery of the tile → alignment ritual → memory deluge → transcription → Liam’s solace and reconfigured understanding of loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tower’s purpose is fulfilled, Elara’s stance toward superstition vs. star-charts is reweighted, and Liam’s grief gains a new conceptual frame. Stakes and transitions are always legible; there are no orientation issues. The only ceiling is that the cost of this closure is more emotional than decisional, with minimal resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: solar storm → magnetic disturbance → amulet activation → spatial tear → crossing → library revelation → return transformed. Orientation (who/where/when) is prompt and solid, and the single transition (escondite to raw spacetime to library) is legible. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing—the world’s rules around goodbyes are redefined and Kaelen’s role shifts. The only limit is that the cosmic library appears almost too conveniently benevolent for the ominous build-up, slightly muting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene of preparation and reflection that leads to a concrete asylum strategy, with a clear before/after. Causality holds under a situational/accumulative lens—each sensory and memory beat contributes to her eventual conceptual breach. Closure lands via a Decisive Change in tactics and a Resonant Reconfiguration of her relationship to honesty and her father. Stakes and costs remain mostly conceptual rather than enacted in-scene, which keeps this just below higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: morning ritual → charting → inscription of invented histories → re-emergence into the bonsai labyrinth, closing on a quiet charged image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s silence redefined from void to canvas, with Elara’s ongoing practice as the stabilizing answer. Causality is simple but coherent—no orientation issues—and the ritual’s steps follow a clear internal logic. The felt cost of her choice (solitude, living amid absence) remains somewhat abstract rather than dramatized in a specific pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: a day-in-routine framed by the tides, with the aconite label serving as the central beat that deepens his ongoing project. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the Aris Thorne mini-arc is cleanly built from prior fragments. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he recommits to being “keeper” of erased histories and walks toward the next “whisper,” with his nameless state reweighted as chosen stance. Stakes remain quiet, but structurally the before/after is legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is tight: observatory entry → note in shell → cello hum → reimagined dialogue → realization, all causally chained under an internal-drive lens. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: she abandons the idea of truth as permanent in favor of a transient, love-powered “compass,” with the cost visible in her grief and relinquished skepticism. There are no orientation issues; the single-scene frame with embedded memory is easy to track. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the process unfolds with little resistance or uncertainty once the method is revealed, so the path to closure feels almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean causal line: OmniCorp’s impending arrival → Kael formulates a plan at dawn → executes it through the night → the community responds, leading to a charged poise on the eve of takeover. Orientation is excellent from the opening; who/where/when are immediately legible, and the OmniCorp “tomorrow at noon” deadline provides a clear narrative clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community now has a covert nervous system and Kael has a clarified stance, though the cost remains largely anticipated rather than dramatized. The piece leans slightly expository in articulating method and stakes, which flattens what could have been a sharper on-page turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is excellent from the first lines: Kael, the crater rim, pre-dawn, and impending mining are all clear. The structure is a clean single-arc vigil culminating in the timed photograph and then a resonant exit, with the chemical rig providing a neat causal thread to the shutter click. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he achieves the photo and chooses to descend, carrying memory while conceding physical loss to “relentless progress.” The main limitation is that pressure rarely tightens beyond anticipation; there’s little sense that the outcome might truly fail, so the arc reads more ceremonial than hard-fought.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal line is clean: the ship is departing, the drone is damaged, Elara must diagnose and repair it in time, then send it off. Structure is straightforward and coherent, with the harbor bell and anchor movement providing a natural clock and the closure landing on her successful release of the drone and return to her basin. The closure is more a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration than a Decisive Change; the world after is recognizably the same, just affirmed. Stakes are never truly in doubt, which softens the sense of cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: falcon’s return → condensation reading → phrasebook confirmation → recognition of the convergence → decision to drill and annotate. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each element reinforcing the same conceptual turn toward “singular convergence” and a quiet closure (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). Cost is mostly conceptual and professional—she’ll contradict “settled science”—rather than dramatized through real resistance. The result is elegant but mild in terms of narrative pressure and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: entrance under the arch, diagnostic touch with the fork, rhythmic traversal of the town with escalating effects, and a clear closure when the town’s heartbeat replaces her own audible steps. Causality is internally consistent—her choices in pace and pattern directly shape the revival—while the “looming collapse” stakes frame the journey without needing explicit timekeeping. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aethel shifts from void to sanctuary, and Elara’s role reconfigures from active healer to subsumed heartbeat. The sense of cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s present and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: submersible failure → distress beacon → descent to temple → methodical unsnarling under time pressure → successful transfer → death with the vial secured. The oxygen timer and journal instructions create clear constraints that tighten toward a resonant Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. The reveal that the beacon was really for the memory, not his life, retrofits neatly but could use one more concrete hint earlier to avoid feeling slightly told. Overall, structure and closure land solidly with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story is structurally clean: one continuous scene, causal progression from Kael’s preparation to Elias’s seeing, to a clear reconfiguration of their relationship and the situation. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric layer—repeated motifs (copperlight, hush, lattice, scuffs) build toward the closure image while the causal hinge is Elias’s choice to look. Closure is solid: knowledge and social reality change (“God forgive us”) with visible emotional cost and an implied future of exhumation. The main limitation is that the external logistics of “three bodies hidden since the ’98 storm” and how the door has remained unexamined rely on a degree of handwaving that the lyric tone partially, but not fully, compensates for.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: bead → resonant awakenings → Heartwood → orchard → Elias’s healing → her release. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (her unmaking) and maintains a stable drive lens without orientation issues. However, the path is almost frictionless—once her goal is stated, every step works on first try, so escalation remains conceptual more than situational. Strong structure, but the lack of real resistance keeps it short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Elara enters the labyrinth, follows her sleepwalking map, intensifies her work at convergences, and culminates in the central basin where sewing the circle delivers a resonant reconfiguration. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds; each step of sewing and each convergence builds logically toward the final act of tying the thread to the orchid and reorienting the path from ruin to living resilience. Closure is solidly on-page with felt emotional cost and a clear before/after in the labyrinth’s meaning. The main limitation is that the journey unfolds without genuine structural surprises or complications, so the arc feels more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: excavation → discovery of the sundial → learning its history → reconstructing the ritual → noon alignment and inner shift, with clear because/therefore links. The closure—her conscious choice to bind herself to the orchard and its rituals—lands on the page with a legible before/after and a felt cost of relinquishing a purely urban, diasporic detachment. The scene remains temporally and spatially coherent, and the noon-shadow alignment is an effective structural hinge. Slightly weaker is the sense of external pressure; nothing seriously threatens failure beyond the possibility of not “feeling” the reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene with a clear throughline—must finalize a pseudonym, encounters the chalk code, reconfigures the choice, then mails the letter. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the children’s markings trigger a conceptual repricing that leads directly to “Aurora, Dawn-Caller” and the mailing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the act of mailing plus the chalk dust on her shoes marks a before/after in her relationship to this specific letter and her craft. The cost is subtle (abandoning meticulously weighed options in favor of vulnerable resonance), but legible enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing Vega’s discrepancy → being dismissed → consulting the eternal candle → uncovering Valerius’s plot → correcting the chart and choosing Idris as the vector of truth. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she foregoes confrontation in favor of a subtler, riskier path with visible stakes for the kingdom. The reliance on a single magical consultation to reveal the entire conspiracy feels convenient and lightly summarized (“The conspiracy unraveled thread by thread”) rather than contested on the page. Still, orientation, drive, and the sense of a before/after are all solidly intact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: regret → quest into the labyrinth → encounter with Elara → ritual that replays the key decision → reframed understanding and release. The single transition into the childhood kitchen via the condensation is legible and motivated by the ritual and shard. Closure is solid: Kael exits with a decisive internal shift and a new relationship to his past and to Lena. The only soft spot is the near-convenient clarity of the message “You are forgiven,” which edges toward easy resolution but doesn’t break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene with reflection braided in, building to a resonant reconfiguration where past trauma is reweighted by present compassion. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the flashback memory is succinct and directly tied to a present cue (the cast phrase). Closure is solidly on-page in the act of whispering to Leo and recognizing she’s also speaking to her younger self and the camp boy. The main weakness is that the structural “turn” is subtle and more thematic than situational, so the before/after difference, while legible, feels less sharply edged than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: knowledge network → courtyard → projection → revelation → integration of fragment → redefined joy, all in one coherent scene. Causality is intact even within a lyric, accumulative frame, and the closure (joy reconfigured, fragment left as seed) is on the page with a legible before/after. The pressure is modest and largely internal, but the beats build in a purposeful order toward a felt culmination. Nothing important is left dangling or retroactively patched.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: question → charged pause → sound-trigger event → successive awakenings → re-placement of the nickel and revised method. Causality is legible and consistent with the world’s rules, and the nested awakenings create a clear accumulation toward an internal closure (conceptual repricing of restoration). The decisive change—trading the goal of “solving” the mural for guarding curiosity—is on the page with a visible before/after. However, the pressure on this decision remains gentle; the stakes are more stated (legacy, dogma) than dramatized in concrete consequences, which keeps the arc from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates as an accumulative/textural build from planting the seed to the first impossible cicada chorus and Aris’s final realization, landing in a clear Charged Poise closure. Because/therefore logic is intact: thought-tax regime → audits → botanical resistance → warp activation. The main structural weakness is that most danger and consequence sit just off-stage (sirens, patrols) rather than forcing a concrete decision in the scene itself. Still, the before/after—sanctuary of study to cathedral of liberation—is legible and paid for conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure follows a clear accumulative/lyric arc: long-established routine → intensified singing night → shell resonance → blossom armistice → reconfigured stasis. Causality is clean within the piece’s magical-lyric logic (his lullaby and touch precipitate the shell’s illumination), and the before/after boundary is legible with emotional cost paid in the centuries of prior suffering. The closure as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration lands solidly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: dawn approaches, the ritual is executed, names are captured, and the day closes in an earned stasis/charged poise. Causality under a textural lens is coherent—light triggers song, crack alters resonance, orchids receive echoes, and reflection reconfigures the crack as resilience. The closure unit (her gratitude to the fracture and articulation of remembrance-as-love) lands with a clear before/after conceptual weighting, though the cost is more implied than viscerally felt. There are no orientation problems or broken set-ups; the limitation is modest dramatic turn rather than structural missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: past misinterpretation → rift → urgent need before council → decoding via promises → key realization → reconciliation with Kael. The piece maintains a coherent time window (one night into dawn) and lands a clear closure beat where their paths reconverge. The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative lyric texture, and the final realization about truth as covenant has a legible emotional cost. Escalation is a little smooth—there’s no serious on-page failure or reversal—but the structure is solid and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: deciphered cipher → placement of vents → controlled exhalation → political reconciliation, all within one continuous scene. The closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the amphitheater shifts from battleground to sanctuary, and the community’s options reweight. However, the crucial investigative work (“Using a method honed…until he deciphered the architect’s hidden cipher”) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the story’s central turn. Stakes resolve without complication or setback, which keeps the structure solid but somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: chip-balancing and dust-mapping → memory rupture → reframed understanding of balance → concrete act of restoration in the ledger → intention to share. Causality is emotional rather than event-heavy, but each step follows clearly and the closure—shifting from concealment to testimony with cost—is legible and on the page. The ledger and Clara are well-seeded so the ending doesn’t feel sudden or unearned. Stakes remain intimate, yet the before/after in his stance toward truth and trust is sharply drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—bench → wood grain → maze memory → logbook → weather code → epiphany—builds cleanly toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is emotional rather than event-driven, but each element arises logically from the one before and contributes to the final understanding. The story maintains a clear present frame on the terrace with well-anchored flashbacks, and the ending decisively reconfigures the meaning of “lost child” and the mother’s absence. Stakes are modest but coherent under a textural/lyric drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: mapping, waiting, sensing the vibration, ascent to the dome, encounter with fireflies, and the release of the feather all build on one another. Causality within the lyric mode holds—each step is a “therefore” rooted in her vow to keep watch until sunrise and her tools. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices belonging and transforms the feather from relic of loss into “a promise of release,” with a visible cost in letting it go. The piece stays within a single temporal window plus one well-anchored flashback, so orientation is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → testing → conjecture → further tests → confirmed understanding → reconfigured stance. The piece lands a clear closure via conceptual repricing: the rules of the cave and of “missing pieces” are reinterpreted with emotional cost. Stakes (learn the truth before it fades) stay coherent, and every experiment tightens knowledge rather than meandering. The only thing keeping this out of the very top band is how frictionless the investigation feels—no serious setbacks or false leads complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: preparation → placement → waiting → encounter → musical aftermath, all in one continuous scene with no orientation issues. Causality is solid under a largely accumulative lens—his planning leads directly to the light flash and altered gait, and the coda with the cello circles back to his ongoing “project” of orchestrated serendipity. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: Corbin’s method is vindicated and emotionally deepened, with a clear before/after in his conviction. The cost is subtle (surrendering the bishop, staking his sense of purpose on this small test), but on the page it remains more gentle confirmation than pressured resolution, which keeps this out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene ritual structure: Elara in exile, Kael’s impending departure, the inscription sequence, then mutual release. Causality is clear (ban → exile → garden ritual → Kael’s fledge → Elara’s release), and orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her “spontaneous anchor” dissolves only once the verse is complete and Kael departs, with cost legible in the three years of exile. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but it coheres and culminates in a distinct before/after at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: pre-dawn walk → ritual at the pond → reframed purpose → return to the waking harbor. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she reconceives her work as covenant, with the pond/atrium imagery knitting the frame together. Causality is soft but present—performing the ritual leads to a clarified stance. The lack of stronger external complication keeps the structural pressure modest, but nothing breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, with a single continuous scene on the ridge and reflection interleaved with small physical beats. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the box shifts from anchor to compass, and the “bargain” is repriced from saving pristine innocence to honoring its evolution. Causality is simple but coherent—his reflective process because-of the box and setting leads to the reweighted understanding and new purpose. Cost is present conceptually (accepting irreversible change and committing to carry it outward), though it remains largely internal and could be sharpened with one concrete external implication.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: grotto ritual → trial balloon → Kael’s dream/action → expanding multiverse echoes → Elara’s renewed stance and ongoing work. Causality within the magical frame is legible and consistent, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reaffirms her role with new data and calm, earned continuity. The conceptual cost—many unseen failures, endless tending—is implied but understated rather than dramatized. Still, the piece holds its drive lens and delivers a coherent before/after reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery of diaries → reading them → finding/reading the negative → reconfiguration of purpose, all in one continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step deepens her relation to memory, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (curiosity becomes covenant). Cost is present but quiet, mostly in the “heart heavier yet clearer” register. Causality holds and there’s no orientation debt, though the arc remains modest rather than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: terrace → first mirror → successive mirrors → central mirror/valley vision → fade-out, all under the ticking clock of the heartbeat and bells. Causality is coherent and simple—he sings, light bends, mirrors change, heartbeat weakens—which fits the ritual design. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the terrace and mirrors have witnessed possibility at the cost of his (borrowed) life, and the child’s waking subtly completes the circle. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a light causal backbone and holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: arrival on the terrace → delegations’ skepticism → Kaelen’s confession and offer to resign → acceptance signaled by the elder → treaty signing and his departure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and stays so. Closure lands solidly with a decisive change (treaty signed, role surrendered) and a felt cost. The only limitation is that resistance from others softens relatively quickly once he reveals his past, slightly reducing structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: a single causal line from arrival on the flats to the ritual of placing the egg, with backstory interleaved to deepen rather than confuse. The drive is accumulative/textural—each detail of drought, memory, and guilt thickens until the final act of release and quiet echo. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he gives the egg to the land and re-chooses his public persona with a new, secret peace. The only minor limitation is the relative simplicity of external complication; the path is straight once he arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene where each beat (approach, initial threads, central knot, release of echoes) follows a clear because/therefore progression under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is solidly on the page—the sanctuary unlocks, the echoes disperse, and the courtyard’s silence is reweighted—with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the danger to Elara never fully crystallizes beyond strain and temptation; stakes stay conceptual rather than situationally sharp. Still, the narrative arc is coherent, and the final reconfiguration of the city’s consciousness lands.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: argument → meteor hush in the dome → reflection around the story stick → decision to transform his practice → forward-looking plan. Causality holds—Lena’s line triggers his doubt, the dome’s listening metaphor reframes his role, and he chooses transcription over performance, which gives the piece a solid Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing. The closure is legible and satisfying, but the argument itself is off-stage and the cost of the decision is mostly conceptual, so the climactic turn feels slightly under-pressured. Still, orientation is clean and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the grotto, with a clear causal hinge when the last monarch appears and Elara repurposes her signal work into an act of repair. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a strong causal spike at the monarch’s arrival; the cadence of ritual → interruption → reconfigured ritual is legible and satisfying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her ritual is completed not through the sky’s acknowledgment but through the monarch’s recovery and departure, with a concrete before/after in her inner certainty. Stakes remain intimate and quiet, which fits the mode but keeps the escalation modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual task (rebraiding the rope according to the punched card) leads causally to illumination and the release/preservation of names, culminating in Elara’s new purpose. The drive reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she exits with a reweighted identity and a cost paid in grief and effort. Setups (lost names, card, rope, sanctum) are all paid off in sequence, with no orientation problems or rule-breaking magic at the end. The main limitation is that the path from start to success feels very smooth, with no structural complication or doubt to tighten the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: impending storm and decay → urgency → breaking the seal → dream-initiation → altered relationship to time → leaving the bunker. The piece reads as a Hybrid (causal plus accumulative/lyric) design with a clear before/after tied to her temporal perception and role. Closure lands on the page with both Decisive Change (she steps out as co-creator) and Resonant Reconfiguration (her “curse” redefined as gift), with a legible cost in relinquishing the old bunker-bound existence. Structure is straightforward and well-contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: years of preparation focus into one continuous ritual that culminates in the tile’s activation and his inner reconfiguration, which functions as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Causality is straightforward—his methodical alignment “therefores” into the glow and recognition—and the global drive lens (textural/accumulative) remains stable. The primary weakness is the thinly dramatized cost: the 20-year investment and frugal sacrifices are mostly asserted, not made to pinch in a specific on-page choice beyond the already-decided ritual. Nonetheless, the before/after of his existential stance is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single contained encounter in the sanctuary, anchored by the arrival, the guided memory work, the pin’s reappearance, and the emotional release. Causality is clear under a primarily accumulative/textural lens: Elara’s long prep → object confrontation → deepened memory → reappearance of the pin → reconfiguration of meaning. Closure is decisive, with Kael’s stance toward his history and self fundamentally altered, and the cost (letting go of a defining resentment) is on the page. World-strangeness (shifting reality) stays consistent and doesn’t confuse orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, ritual-driven structure is clean: arrive with broken tool → synchronize with orchard → repair → invite dream → sanctuary/closure. Causality is coherent and legible, and the final reconfiguration (fog as veil, bud on the tree, sextant humming) delivers a clear RR/CR-style closure. The main limitation is the lack of serious on-page friction; the dream’s appearance and acceptance feel almost guaranteed once the pattern is established, so the outcome rarely feels in doubt. Still, within a lyric mode, the throughline holds up very well.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a causal chain from entering to mending to Lyra’s arrival and emotional resolution. The closure (reframing vows as deciduous and embodying that in the repaired window) lands solidly on the page with a clear before/after. Lyra’s timely entrance is a touch convenient, but the letter/ribbon link gives it enough grounding to avoid feeling arbitrary. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized loss, but it’s legible and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: bewilderment → failed inquiry with the cameo → bathroom reflection → conceptual breakthrough about nonlinear inheritance → ritualized inquiry in the orchard → transfer of memory and ledger transformation. Structure is tight for the length, with the bathroom shard functioning as a hinge rather than a digression. Closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration—she moves from outsider seeking forbidden extraction to accepted steward bearing luminous responsibility. The main limitation is that the stakes, though conceptually weighty, never face tangible external resistance, leaving the arc intellectually satisfying but somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: search → encounter with disintegrating Kael → discovery of the diary gap → confrontation with the Warden → renegotiation → descent and rescue → post-mission reorientation. Closure is solid: Kael is literally saved and Elara’s global drive is conceptually repriced as she reframes the library’s purpose and her role in it. The cost—risking herself through vulnerable truth and choosing to remain as a caretaker rather than following Kael—lands on the page. Structure stays within one coherent window without temporal confusion, and the ending image ties directly back to the initial drive.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present exploration → warped memories → discovery of the journal → conceptual reframing → decisive act of release. Closure lands clearly with the tossing of the emerald card and the internal redefinition of the “garden,” with a felt cost in surrendering her last concrete tether to Kael. Causality is soft but consistent with the lyric mode, and there are no orientation or lens issues. A hairline limitation is that the journal’s revelation functions as a neatly packaged thesis, slightly easing the structural tension rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous door → recognition of the seal → recall of the fable → rope reconfiguration → resolution, with no teleports or rule breaks. The piece infers a largely causal drive with a light accumulative/thematic overlay, and the closure (door vanishing, clock resuming, conceptual integration of absence) lands clearly with visible before/after. Stakes remain conceptual rather than life-altering, but within that frame the structure is tight and proportionate. There are no orientation problems or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival of energy beings → shattered equilibrium → descent to Glacial Heart → discovery in cracks → ritual → bloom of hush. Closure is decisive and on the page, and the cost (three days of strain, bodily relief, and reconfigured role) is legible. The main weakness is how easily the ritual works once the anomaly is found—no serious false start or complication to test his resolve. Still, structure is coherent and satisfying for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: long-term preparation → precise celestial timing → use of shard and prism → beacon rekindled → visible human response. The structure—a present-tense ascent framed by brief, well-anchored retrocognitive and backstory shards—remains clear and serves the climax without disorientation. Closure lands solidly as a decisive change with conceptual reweighting: the world now has a functioning beacon and concrete proof that “coincidences” are intentional signals, with Elara’s life of effort as the implicit cost. A slightly more acute on-page jeopardy (even the possibility of failure in the ritual itself) would deepen structural tension but is not strictly necessary for coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: storm observation → doubt about severed memory → fissure discovery → decision to write → answered whisper. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the solid fog is re-priced from tomb to sanctuary, and her stance shifts with on-page cost (relinquishing the old forecourt as sole vessel). Causality is mostly sound, though the ritual of "examining shadow lengths" feels under-exploited as an actual decision driver rather than a textured backdrop. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable throughout and supports the quiet but definite ending turn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → chant/heightening perception → problem (message hidden) → tactical response (light and filter) → deciphering → renewed vow. Causality is consistent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands with a clear before/after in her stance toward hopelessness. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the idea of carrying this burden of hope back into a bleak world is legible. The scene avoids confusion or orientation issues, yet the pressure never tightens beyond a gentle puzzle, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure: the argument is over, and the silence becomes the field where images accrete until Elara makes a small but decisive conversational turn. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the final beat—Kael’s “old shell was too tight” and their softening into new conversation—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. The causal link between her observations, her “foresight,” and the specific choice to reach for a shared memory is legible, if understated. Stakes and consequences stay small-scale but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a tight, single-arc accumulative scene: anticipation → inversion → gilded hush → visible sprouting → reconfiguration at landing, with no orientation debt. Causality is clean under a textural lens: the inversion and hush trigger both Elara’s internal shift and the seed’s sprout, which then reframes her relationship to fear and space. Closure is strong: before/after is legible in her dissolved claustrophobia and in the doll’s charged repositioning with the sprout. Stakes remain mostly internal and spiritual, but the progression never meanders or soft-resets.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a tight, single-scene structure where each move (train’s departure → deepening quiet → guided listening → re-association of silence) flows logically and accumulatively. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through attention to subtle sounds and Leo’s gradual openness rather than overt events. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: silence is reweighted from threat to companion, with his whispered line about the quiet “feeling like her now” marking a clear before/after. The cost—carrying grief within this new silence—remains on the page and keeps the ending from feeling pat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: shard → waterfall threshold → orchard → monolith → peeling → revelation → reinterpretation of the throne → spoken glyphs and restoration. The ticking clock of sunrise provides a continuous structural pressure that pays off when the first ray activates the staircase. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the throne’s nature is redefined, and Elara’s choice reconfigures what “ascension” means for the world. The only mild limitation is that the time constraint feels slightly elastic given the volume of layered history she uncovers without any real setback or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: fading threshold → psychic contact through the scar → shared breathing → re-stabilized boundary and chosen non-reunion, with clear before/after. The closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she consciously maintains the barrier while reconfiguring its meaning from mere wall to compassionate threshold, with the cost of continued separation legible. Causality is intact under an accumulative/lyric lens, with each step feeling like a natural intensification of the prior one. The only limit is that the external situation never complicates in any surprising way beyond the initial encroachment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: calm setup in the farm, announcement of the Convergence, volunteering, the Heartroot ritual, and the quieter epilogue with the burial. Causality is intact—pyramid-scheme trauma → quantum messages + Convergence → volunteering → bolt sacrifice → diamond—and there is clear closure in her letting go of the bolt and redefining herself. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with a strong accumulative lyric charge), and the final reconfiguration of her identity lands. Stakes stay somewhat abstractly “perilous,” with little concrete sense of what could go wrong, which keeps the escalation from feeling truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight and causal: desire for truth → application of the “bridge of intuition” → discovery of the dust pattern → secret panel → letter that reconfigures her understanding. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, but cause-and-effect is intact and clear, and the final conceptual repricing of “legacy” lands on the page. Closure is solid: her stance toward the dynasty shifts in a way that clearly divides before/after and carries a felt cost (letting go of the identity of failure). The only constraint at this level is that external stakes remain modest and the process carries little genuine risk of failure or complication once the method is invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear progression from discovery → ritual navigation → climactic act → transformed aftermath. Causality holds under a mostly causal-but-lyric lens: because he finds the program, he performs the patterns, reaches the pedestal, and unsnaps the clasp, which triggers the dawn-like shift. Closure is solid (DC+RR), with a legible before/after for both knight and orchard. The main limitation is that the “critical timeframe” and associated urgency are declared more than dramatically tested, so escalation feels a touch conceptual rather than viscerally ticking.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: discovery of the hidden envelope serves as the central hinge, and the closing reframe of Elara’s role and the file room provides clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Causality is simple but intact—her method leads to the envelope, which leads to the note/button, which catalyze the revaluation of her work and past. Orientation (who/where/when) is quickly and cleanly established, and the piece never loses its spine. The cost—living with loneliness but now reframed as purposeful guardianship—is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: compromised network → solitary quest → puddle-map to the booth → retrieval of records → lagoon broadcast → enforcers arrive after the signal is away. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a light accumulative texture, and the closure—her decision to stand firm once the truth is irreversibly transmitted—lands with a legible cost. Nothing important teleports or resets, and setup elements (key, lagoon, revised histories) all pay off. The only limitation is that the enforcers’ arrival feels somewhat generic and late-introduced as pressure rather than a fully developed structural counter-force.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene framed by departure and return, with the drive lens largely accumulative/textural as sound and silence gradually reconfigure the threat of the prophecy. Causality is intact—his specific use of negative space and timed playing as dewdrops form causes the prophecy’s coded words to fray and dissolve. Closure is strong and on-page: the prophecy is hushed, the atrium’s light unifies, and Elias exits changed, carrying the “vested hush.” The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than plot-hefty, but it is legible and tied to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual-like scene with a clear inciting incident (the marked leaf), development (legend + monument), and closure (the communion and reconfiguration of her resolve). Causality in an accumulative/lyric sense holds throughout—each step logically leads to the next and culminates in a resonant final stance. The closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a sharp turn, and while cost is implied, it’s not strongly dramatized. Overall, it’s coherent and complete but not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causality is clean: the admiral’s plea → locket clue → greenhouse → latch → staircase → waterfall → compass → internal revaluation, with no teleporting information or broken logic. The story delivers a clear closure via conceptual repricing: “Direction was not a fixed point…” reweights all prior action. Stakes are modest but coherent; the quest’s external throughline is never lost. Structure is straightforward single-POV, single through-line, with one deepening turn underground, well suited to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: preparation → ritual activation → memory/feeling crescendo → object’s transformation → internal reconfiguration. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with each physical step of the alchemy deepening the emotional stakes and leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as “Kael” is reweighted from burden to compass. Closure lands convincingly in the restored crucible and Elara’s altered feeling toward the name, with a legible emotional cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, though the progression is more steady than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: Elara arrives with a goal, invokes her method, draws Cora out, deepens the encounter through laughter, and releases the spirit, with a clear before/after. Causality is straightforward and legible, and the closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration (Cora’s release and Elara’s familiar ache). The single continuous scene suits the scale and the drive lens (hybrid but predominantly accumulative/textural) without confusion. Stakes and cost are modest but coherent, with no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: waking from anesthesia, testing memories via triggered trauma responses, and reweighting the mask strap all flow logically. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the strap shifts from shackle to compass and his stance toward his pain becomes purposeful pattern-making. However, the global drive (internal inquiry rather than external decision pressure) keeps the narrative feeling more like a long, continuous beat than a scene with a distinct turn in options. Cost is present but largely conceptual and interior, which slightly mutes structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: alchemist’s market → three-painting sequence → shard placement → reoriented descent, with each canvas escalating her insight. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Hemlock’s story is literally woven back into the world and her stance toward history is clarified. Causality at this scale is sound: shard + paintings + intuition produce the key turn. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story tracks cleanly under a causal lens: Leo comes for the elevator, is drawn to the ticket office by his ceiling-obsession, decodes the dust, contacts Elias, uncovers the cache, and exits with a new mission. The closure is solid—Elias gains peace and Leo takes on the burden of delivering the legacy, a Decisive Change in circumstance and task with a quiet but clear cost. Orientation is excellent from the first lines; time and place never blur. The one limitation is that obstacles are minimal, so tension in the structural spine relies mostly on discovery rather than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: frost alignment → uncorked whisper → escalating awakening → rupture → transformed library, with no major logic gaps. The story lands a solid closure via a decisive act (pulling the lever) that reconfigures the world and her relationship to it, and the cost is at least conceptually legible in the risk of destabilizing a perfected system. That said, the threat never crystallizes into a truly acute on-page dilemma or near-failure—events progress smoothly toward a largely positive transformation. Strong, coherent structure, but the stakes never quite bite hard enough for top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: temporal storm → mirror-covering tactic → undistorted revelation → devised projection → confrontation with the Council → dispute resolved, with a clear before/after in how the Aethel are understood. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the civilization’s meaning, the Council’s stance, and Kaelen’s legacy are all reweighted with visible emotional cost (“vindication arriving too late for its prophet”). The structure is linear, well-anchored in a single location with one temporal disruption, and the storm is well-integrated rather than a late gimmick. The only structural softness is that the Council’s acceptance happens swiftly and without any on-page resistance, slightly diminishing the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Midnight’s theft → Kael’s decision to act in the resonance chamber at the precise midnight → forging the tether → command and release of the light. Orientation (who/where/when) is quickly and firmly established, and the one-scene ritual shape suits the piece. Closure is decisive and on the page: light returns, the cosmic covenant is reconfigured but not broken, and Kael reaches an earned stasis of peace. The only restraint on a higher score is that the success feels slightly inevitable; there’s little sense of possible failure beyond his physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: fissure → lagoon → compass → psychometric vision → internal revaluation → renunciatory choice, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she abandons the need to sample or explain in favor of carrying an internal awakening, and the before/after line is legible. Orientation (who/where/what) is firm very early, and the single-scene frame is stable. The only limitation is that external obstacles are minimal, so the sense of structural risk is more spiritual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: GPS failure → refuge under the arch → ancestral recall and carving → reoriented departure, all coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her sense of navigation shifts, with the seabird and lantern slide anchoring the before/after. However, the causal stakes of the storm and GPS loss remain low; nothing in the present materially tests or endangers her, so the turn, while clear, feels low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: postcards → clue → waiting through thaw → dawn encounter with the glass → reconfigured understanding → return to art. Causality is intact under a textural lens, with the note on the postcard and the salvaged window motivating her dawn experiment and the closing change in her painting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of darkness and light, with a legible cost in grief and reorientation of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: decrypting the diary triggers the vision, which allows an intervention that resolves the historical tension and reconfigures the ending knowledge. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph (who/where/when are immediately legible), and the shift into vision and back is clearly marked. Closure lands as a decisive change in Elias’s understanding and the movement’s recorded history, with a coherent before/after. The main soft spot is that the retrocognitive mechanism appears abruptly without prior world groundwork, though the story treats it as a one-off intrusion rather than a system, so causality still holds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: sensory recollection leads to conceptual blueprinting, then to a concrete foundational act of planting the bottle. Causality holds throughout—her memories directly generate specific plans, which then drive her movement to the plaza and the greenhouse sketch. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses the magical-return path and commits to a long, craft-based rebuilding, with the bottle buried as a vow. The main limitation is that the cost is more conceptual than viscerally tested on the page, and escalation is smooth rather than sharply tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-tense silence and artifact → immersion attempt → deepening memory → reinterpretation of childhood moment → reconfiguration of her life’s work and a charged exit image. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with the waxing resonance of the silence and prophecy building toward a conceptual repricing of what “archive” means. Causality is coherent—each realization flows from a concrete cue, and the closure (archiving complete; cultivation begun) lands on the page with a distinct before/after. Stakes are modestly scaled but fully appropriate for a lyric piece focused on vocation and cosmology.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: post-hatching stillness → decision to reopen the vortex → entropy-reducing ritual → contact with the vortex → reconfigured understanding as she leaves. Causality is intact and legible under a largely accumulative/textural lens, with each ordered act tightening toward the vortex’s emergence and stabilization. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: winter is re-read as cradle, and “borrowed time” is revalued as covenant with future renewal. Stakes remain more conceptual than pressured—nothing substantial threatens to derail the ritual—so structural elegance somewhat outweighs dramatic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean and linear: the prophecy sets the frame, the approach of zero hour tightens, and the moment of non-action creates clear closure (Earned Stasis). Causality is coherent under a Situational/Accumulative lens: decades of data → present calm → decision not to ring → doctrinal shift. The main limitation is cost: the choice is never truly tested by external consequences or resistance, so the after-image is tranquil rather than sharply priced. Nonetheless, the before/after (alarm culture vs doctrine of listening) is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: nightly ritual → extraordinary meteor → emotional/conceptual repricing → grounded return to sweeping. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where his role shifts from custodian to “guardian of quietude,” with a clear before/after and an earned, if gentle, cost (his old sense of insignificance). Causality operates more thematically than plot-wise but remains coherent, with the meteor as the decisive intensifier rather than a random flourish. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: daily ritual → pieced-together backstory → new gaze from Elias → release and reconfiguration of the recluse’s role. Causality is clean under a textural lens: his sustained guardianship and interpretive work make possible the final nod and dissolution. Closure is strong—a clear before/after in the oasis’s psychic state and the recluse’s understanding—though the middle leans heavily on summarized history instead of beats that alter present options. Orientation is solid from the first sentence, and the ending pays off the introduced elements.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: damaged capsule → contact with fragment → timeless revelation → months-long dissemination → final handoff to Elara, with all turns causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure—Kael dissolving as Elara takes up the fragment and purpose—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after and conceptual cost. The brief summary of “months” of garage sales compresses some potential mid-story pressure but doesn’t break coherence. Orientation (who/where/what) is solid early, and the story maintains one dominant drive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: lagoon observation → kite snapping → discovery of feather → writing with it → reframed acceptance at the end. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she converts discord into a deepened, practiced stance. Cost is present but subtle—she chooses acceptance and relinquishment over interference—keeping the piece coherent but emotionally modest.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—repeated connection rituals leading to a final orchard-wide activation—reads cleanly and causally, with clear before/after at the end. The six-month diagnosis and his worsening body provide a simple but coherent spine, and the closure (the chime, network illumination, and his death) is on-page with visible cost. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues; the pattern of work → partial responses → culmination is legible. The structure is purposeful but also quite linear and low-friction, with few surprises or turns in tactics, which limits its ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: artificial pilgrimage context → choice of sculpture path → discovery and following of footprints → fissure → resin chamber → shared revelation with Elias. The piece delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing at the end, as the nature of “homecoming” and the tower is redefined with on-page cost (they must carry a secret that undercuts the state ritual). Structure is linear, focused, and well-scoped for the length, with one meaningful tightening when the footprints lead into the hidden fissure. A slight ease of discovery (very little resistance or jeopardy en route) keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival → ritual actions guided by birds → nightingale sign → tiny sprout and renewed certainty. Causality is coherent within the fable-like rules (bird speech → specific gardening choices), and the submerged concord backstory reweights present actions without derailing the scene. Closure lands in the image of the defiant green thread and Kael’s resolved intention, with the cost registered as his carried grief and long-term commitment. Structure is simple but well-shaped for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: Rusthaven stasis → Anya’s arrival and the cylinder → failed attempts to decode → memory-triggered insight via the leaf → Elara’s message → departure. The piece lands solid closure with a decisive change (breaking his retirement) and a felt price (leaving his hard-won refuge for a dangerous wasteland). Structure is mostly single-scene with a clean night-to-dawn transition, and no orientation debt. The one weakness is that the puzzle resolves rather quickly and neatly once the memory cue arrives, which slightly softens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single-scene accumulative build where the glimpse of Lyre is the central turn that reconfigures her understanding of the shutdown and her grandfather’s disappearance. Causality is intact—shutdown → stabilized field → glimpse → hypothesis—and closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing of the family ritual and her role. The cost is modest but legible: she embraces a long, solitary, high-uncertainty “expedition” rather than passive remembrance. Escalation could be strengthened by a more concrete, on-page risk or a sharper sense of what she might lose by choosing this path.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael ascends the spire to fix the sky, enters the observatory, systematically swaps pieces, and the heavens correspondingly heal, culminating in a decisive before/after change. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one continuous scene and a clear climax at the gardener king’s placement. Cost is somewhat soft—there’s brief despair and environmental groaning, but little real risk that the process might fail or backfire. Still, closure is on-page and legible, with a solid sense of mission completed and path reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: each spelled word releases a memory, building toward the gallery-wide chorus and conceptual shift that the interregnum is fertile rather than void. Causality is coherent under this lens—her deliberate ritual produces the unbinding and reconfiguration of meaning. Closure lands via a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the chessboard’s emptiness is reweighted by the whispers and the companions’ new role. The piece avoids orientation problems and sustains one dominant drive from entry to exit.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: discovery of the stone → instructions → ritual with the feather → internal breakthrough → bookstore’s response and exit path. Closure lands with a clear before/after: from avoidance and confinement to reclaimed talent and forward motion, with a felt cost in the seeding pain. Orientation is strong from the opening; the ritual instructions are introduced just in time and paid off directly. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a stable causal spine and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael seeks absolution, learns of lock and key, decodes the tapestry via a chess-informed method, manipulates the labyrinth, and breaks the woven hush, leading to a clear before/after. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he frees the village and reconfigures his relationship to his past error with a legible emotional cost. Structure is simple and coherent, but the problem-solving path is quite smooth—there’s little friction, failed attempt, or uncertainty once he begins decoding, which slightly undercuts peak tension. Still, the single-scene arc works well at this length and the final turn is fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and well-shaped: the piece moves causally from the charged hush, to Elara’s poetry, to communal reaction, to Borin’s intervention, culminating in a reconfigured ritual. The closure (a revised Ritual of Unburdening that incorporates multiple perspectives) lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost to the community’s simpler unity. Causality is coherent throughout, with the canyon acoustics and poetry sessions acting as a clear engine of change. The only limit is that the turn from confrontation to concession (“With a slow nod… he amended the ritual”) comes a bit easily, with little structural resistance before capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: catastrophic gear failure → single sustained ritual under time pressure → resonant reconfiguration when the sparrow’s mending halts the destruction and reweights the situation. Causality is mostly accumulative/textural—each stitched memory deepens and tightens the drive toward meaning—yet the external world’s response (workshop and sea calming) still feels motivated within the dire-enchantment frame. Closure is strong: Kael’s stance toward oblivion and the meaning of Lyra’s loss decisively shifts, with the cost (his imminent death) plainly intact. The "between breaths held underwater" device flirts with frozen-time implausibility but is thematically coherent enough not to damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: mirror crack → reawakened promise → walk with shell → grief-induced misstep → hidden cave → reinterpreting the promise → leaving the shell. Structure is linear and coherent, with the cave sequence functioning as a single deepening shard and the exit reinforcing closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—he changes his understanding of devotion and grief, with the shell left behind as concrete cost. No significant orientation or lens-clarity issues under an accumulative/textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear and coherent: the heat wave’s end leads to Elias testing the vial, which causes Silas’s experience and confession, yielding closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step increases the emotional and conceptual charge around “whispers” versus “shouts” without breaking causality. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Silas’s worldview shifts and Elias’s belief is vindicated at emotional cost. The only ceiling issue is that the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharply tightened, so the change feels quiet rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: failed hydraulics → nights of calls → ritual construction → “complete the circuit” → visions → reconfigured stance toward grief. Causality is coherent under a lyric/accumulative lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost (she accepts ongoing material brokenness in exchange for emotional integration). Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the pattern of midnight calls and builds is taught early and paid off. Some steps are more told than dramatized, but they don’t undercut the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece holds a clean accumulative/causal line: obtain relic → reach orchard after storm → harvest truffle → commit to the coming ritual. Reflection is well anchored in the present journey and checkpoint memory, never confusing orientation. Closure lands as a charged poise: she turns toward home with a clarified stance and accepted cost, and the before/after is legible without needing the ritual itself on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dock discovery → study reflection → interpretive build → closure in the lantern room. The drive lens is textural rather than causal, and the pattern of tokens/“borrowed memories” is taught early and paid off at the end with Silas’s reconfigured sense of duty. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he accepts ongoing witnesshood with an articulated cost (bearing others’ loneliness) recast as purpose. The main limitation is that the investigative “plot” never tightens beyond contemplative inference, so the sense of turn is more gentle than striking.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain from chip glimmer → coordinates → cavern → ants → doorway → realization is coherent and legible under a Causal lens, with no major orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “doorway of decisions” is revealed to be an internal threshold, which reweights all prior action and the mentor’s charge. Cost is present—risk of drowning, the time of lonely vocation, the emotional vulnerability of believing—but it’s felt more conceptually than viscerally. The only minor softness is how neatly the creek’s threat is dispelled once the realization occurs, slightly undercutting the physical stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: ominous dreams → concrete warning → climb → grotto revelation → return with reconfigured purpose, and closure lands as a decisive inner change plus a new outward commitment. The ember grotto and bleeding starlight pay off the early mystery in a legible, earned way, and the cost—recognition of her complicity and the work ahead—is clear. The drive lens reads mostly Causal with a strong conceptual repricing at the end. Escalation is more spiritual than logistical, but it coheres, and there are no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Elara’s preparation → arrival of Kael and Lyra → secret → alchemical intervention → conceptual shift. Causality under the textural lens holds: each beat deepens the central moment rather than branching into subplots, and the closure—revaluing worth from possession to presence—is legible and on-page. The ember nexus flaring and the “density of presence solidify[ing]” mark a clear before/after in the story’s conceptual world. Stakes remain quiet and internal, but within that frame the arc is coherent and fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece is cleanly structured: present in the cabin → entry into the dream-flight → encounter with past selves and emotional turn → waking with the scroll and a reweighted stance toward the grave. Causality under an accumulative lens is coherent—the grave visit triggers the need to write, which triggers the dream, which yields the message that reframes his crisis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he’s still “chronologically confused,” but the grave’s power is conceptually repriced, and that cost/relief is palpable. No orientation or lens-clarity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: Mrs. Gable arrives with a problem, Elara chooses to engage, repairs the clamp, and emerges with a reconfigured understanding of her purpose. The drive lens reads as chiefly accumulative/textural—the clocks, fog, clamp, and touch-based work accrete into the final conceptual shift. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: her disability and altered vocation are repriced, with cost (permanent loss) still present but integrated. Stakes remain modest and there is no real narrative swerve or complication mid-scene, which keeps this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous, time-bounded ritual scene, escalating from preparation, to near-failure when the ink crystallizes, to breakthrough via the tear and the scars’ transformation. Causality is tight (stress → crystallization → recollection of superstition → tear → reversal), and closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after. The “held breath timeframe” and delayed tea master act as a subtle clock that resolves with the wind and bell. The limitation is that external stakes and consequences remain modest, so the sense of risk is mostly internal rather than structurally constricting.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with a clear causal chain from Elara’s arrival and preparation through the ritual, apology, and Valerius’s release. The global drive reads as Hybrid but dominated by accumulative/textural pressure (scent, sound, dust, orchard) supporting a causal throughline. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard is lost, but the tether is mended, with the axe strike and recorking of the bottle marking a definitive before/after. No major causality or orientation slips; the only limitation is that the path to success contains few surprises or structural complications.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative spiral structure is clean: each revolution tests a new concept (“causality,” “identity,” “hope/despair,” “memory,” then “existence”), building toward the blank page as a natural climax. Causality is coherent—her method of spiral arbitration explains the repeated inward/outward moves and why speaking definitions repairs reality. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: refusing an external definition of “existence” in favor of “I am” stabilizes the universe and redefines her role. The cost—a permanent charge of guardianship and existential solitude—is legible though slightly under-emphasized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure from whistle to backward counting to conceptual epiphany is clean and coherent, with each count tightening the frame toward the droplet’s fall and the sun’s resumption. The magical-realism causality is internally consistent: key → hidden droplet → counting → altered perception → restored flow with new understanding, and orientation is clear throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: he stops trying to reverse time and instead accepts its “texture,” and that stance shift is legible with a before/after. The cost—relinquishing the fantasy of control for contemplative acceptance—is implied rather than sharply tested, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clear throughline from arrival to test to emotional reconfiguration, and all setup elements (mycelial barrier, beam, grief) pay off at the laser-press moment. Causality is sound under a hybrid causal/textural lens—the experiment leads to conversation, which leads to reframing, which charges the final act and realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: grief is reweighted from intrusion to permeable passage with a legible cost (letting herself feel and release). There are no orientation issues or dropped threads, though the external “stakes” of the prototype remain lightly sketched rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—journal clue → subway station → lantern-activated door → subway-seat message—tracks cleanly and supports a coherent accumulative arc. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes her father and her own stance, with the lantern and “traverse” practice as ongoing commitments. Stakes stay mostly internal and conceptual; the piece never truly corners her into a hard choice with visible alternative paths. Even so, structure is tight for the length with no orientation issues and a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: phone rings → confession of the grief-loop → Elara reframes and offers a new pattern → he chooses to stop dialing and redirect his ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the loop is not “solved” but consciously repurposed, with the cost visible in giving up nightly contact. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, and it holds consistently to the charged final image of the booth as harbor. The only brake on a higher score is how quickly the caller’s stance shifts, which slightly softens the felt difficulty of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/ritual frame: she comes to the jetty, performs a methodical ritual, and that sequence culminates in a credible emotional reconfiguration. The closure—pressing the locket to the damp covenant and reframing grief as a “compass”—lands clearly with visible cost in the act of releasing “sorrow’s weight.” Orientation is impeccable; we always know who, where, and when. The only limit is that the outcome feels quite assured from early on, so the turn, while graceful, is somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single temporal window at the station framed by anchored flashback-like memories, leading to the arrival of the young woman and Elara’s decisive shift. Causality is coherent (rumor → meeting → choice) under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (her redefined “permanent post” and new aim) is on the page with conceptual and emotional cost. The avalanche anecdote and Nepalese astronomer are efficiently tied back into the present decision, not left hanging. The arc is subtle and quiet, so the sense of “pressure” is more thematic than situational, which keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—from cobblestone edge to forest heart to stillpoint—reads coherent and deliberate, with a clear before/after in her relationship to grief. Each beat (warming ring, converging notes, arrival at silence) causally deepens rather than resets. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: her map is “complete,” grief reweighted as enduring love with a felt sense of release. The main limitation is that cost and risk feel low; nothing seriously threatens her reaching the stillpoint or failing to integrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present in the anomaly → recollection of the Lyra misreading → ritual unbending → sending edits → departure with renewed purpose, all under a single POV. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with causal anchors in the pen ritual and the anomaly’s properties, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (she cannot fix the past but can alter its legacy). Stakes and cost—the irrevocable deaths vs. what she can still do—remain legible throughout. The lack of external complication or real resistance to her plan keeps the structural tension somewhat low for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, one-night structure is clean: harbor ritual → interruption by Lily → dawn realization, with no orientation issues. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his practice is re-priced from private memorial to shared invitation, with the cost of remaining vulnerable to loss. Causality is modest but coherent—Lily’s arrival and shared signing directly produce his new stance. The piece slightly telegraphs its arc, but the before/after is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael enters the archive, follows a deliberately laid trail, decodes the vandalized self-portrait as notation, and thereby unlocks the Canticle, with each step flowing logically from the last. The closure—a decisive discovery plus a reconfiguration of his self-concept—is on the page and coherent under a causal drive lens. However, obstacles are minimal: he solves each artistic clue smoothly, so stakes feel more asserted (healing the valley) than concretely tested in scene. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, which works but leaves some potential structural tension untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one scene, one drive, a clear escalation (from drumming → partial reconstitution of the dream → loss and seed). Causality is intact and legible under a primarily accumulative lens—each rhythmic act intensifies the environment and leads to the temporary restoration. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: he fails to fully restore but proves the dream’s persistence and commits to ongoing rebellion with visible emotional cost. The stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, but they are consistently handled, not abstract hand-waving.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael identifies Vale’s walk, chooses Junction Gamma, leverages the whispering gallery, and reveals the hidden system, all flowing logically. The structure is a single coherent scene with one clear tightening: the move from chaotic shouting to deliberate whisper-guidance via the secret channel. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Vale’s view of Kael’s “relic” methods and the port’s acoustics is transformed, and Kael’s principle is validated. The cost is predominantly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized (little sense of real danger or potential failure), which restrains the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates symbolic actions (mirror, shutters, Orion) toward a clear internal reconfiguration for Elara. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the cadence builds well and the closure—her secret dissolving into a “larger celestial story”—lands. Causality is simple but coherent: Kael’s specific interventions prompt her gaze to lift and tension to release. The main limitation is the sense of low cost and low resistance; the transformation feels a touch inevitable and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: from library preparation to dawn installation to the town’s quiet response, each movement follows logically. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with pressure building through pattern and culminating in the town’s subtle shifts in behavior. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias witnesses his rebellion bearing fruit and internalizes a conceptual victory with a cost paid in long, quiet labor. The cost is understated but legible; there are no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: dock → row out → dive → whale call/scrimshaw activation → island → disappearance → return, with a clear before/after shift in her internal state. Causality under a largely accumulative lens holds: the whale call triggers the scrimshaw, which unlocks her heart and reveals the island as a mirror of that shift. Closure is solid—a Decisive Change plus a Conceptual Repricing of the scrimshaw’s role—with an on-page cost in letting go of shame and weaponry. The main limitation is that the outcome feels almost guaranteed once the ritual begins, with little doubt about success or possible failure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear and well anchored from the opening image of the farmhouse under turbines to the final turbine shadow sweep. Backstory about the Happiness Mandate and Elara is cleanly cued by concrete objects (bouquet, turbines) and consistently reorients us back into the present ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines silence and his relationship to grief, with an on-page cost in accepting his complicity and vulnerability. Causality is steady—each reflection and action arises naturally from the previous beats without outline-like “and then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, ritual-like structure is clean: approach → contact with the colonnade → successive paraphrases → boundary dissolution → quiet aftermath, with each step legible and causally linked under a textural lens. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the ban’s division is undone, the lake and atrium unified, and the poet emerges with a reweighted understanding of poetry’s purpose. The main weakness is cost: the supposed sacredness of the boundary never generates on-page resistance or ambiguity, so lifting the ban feels serene rather than fraught. Still, the scene is coherent, self-contained, and lands a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s arrival and arrangement draw Kael out, the reed and “question” premise lead to the glass sphere, which in turn leads to the concertina note and mutual re-seeing. The piece delivers a clear before/after: Kael’s stance toward imperfection reconfigures, and Elara gains a new sensory “palette.” Cost is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, but legible: perfectionism is relinquished, and her entire practice must be reimagined. Structure is straightforward and cohesive, if slightly low in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates pressure from clinical demonstration request to paradigm shift, under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is coherent—her refusal to treat sound as mere data leads to the experimental prism-song, which in turn triggers the Resonator’s transformation and the lab’s reorientation. Closure is solidly a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the institution’s purpose changes and Elara exits, having paid an emotional cost. The main weakness is how smoothly the shift occurs, with minimal resistance or complication once she begins, which slightly undercuts the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: rock bottom → pilgrimage to observatory → ritual with the crane → revelation of the fungi nebula → reoriented purpose, with a tight causal chain under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: grief is repriced as “fertile ground” and her future tactics are concretely altered (seed-jewelry, coordinate pendants, teaching others). The backstory of previous cranes and the workshop is interleaved economically and always tilts the present. It stops short of a more surprising or risky final turn, but within the chosen mode the closure is strong and fully on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece tracks cleanly: Leo’s arrival, Elara’s decision to share her method, and Leo’s reframed understanding of his grief and actions. The causal chain is modest but coherent, with the grandmother connection justifying his visit and the map session producing a legible before/after in Leo. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Leo leaves straighter, carrying a literal map segment, and Elara returns to work with a slightly deepened sense of lineage and ongoing ripples. Stakes remain low-key and largely conceptual, so the structure feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: approach the pagoda → initiate ritual → progressively more charged memories → core atom confrontation → departure with reconfigured purpose. Orientation is impeccable from the first line, and the rules of the ritual and world are consistent enough to support the stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: “marking her passage across the end of innocence” and committing to return with hard truths. The only limit to a higher score is that the external consequences remain entirely projected off-page, keeping the frame slightly contained.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: disturbance (the shadow), investigation (archive nook, footage comparison), revelation (shadow’s true function), and reconfigured stance (acceptance and collaboration). Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each step meaningfully reweights the central question of what it means to “preserve” hope. The closure image—the metamorphosing stone and re-seen library—delivers a clear conceptual repricing with an on-page cost (luminous regret and relinquished rigidity). A touch more on-page resistance or risk at the outset could intensify the inciting pressure, but the overall arc is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a single night of reckoning after betrayal—holds cleanly, with a stable POV and clear temporal and spatial anchors. The drive lens reads as situational/accumulative: the revealed con and Kael’s injury pressure Elara into a stance decision rather than external plot maneuvers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines trust and implements concrete changes (latch, questionnaire, wearing the tail) with an evident cost—the end of naïve openness. The main limitation is that the primary inciting incident (Dr. Aris’s exposure) is entirely off-page, so all escalation is retrospective rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative design: wake → noticing objects → plant telepathy → acorn/root-tunnel parable → conceptual shift at closure. Causality under a textural lens holds: each new image (fern, oak, acorn, coffee ring, hourglass) deepens or reframes her stance rather than feeling random. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: scars reconceived as tunnels, with a concrete renunciation (“She would no longer seek closure by opening wounds”). The cost—abandoning her old interpretive method and accepting an unwanted miracle—is present but could be dramatized with a sharper sense of what she’s giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure—a present-time ritual in the booth leading to a 1943 immersion and back—reads as clean and legible, with a clear accumulative/textural drive. Causality is coherent: her psychometry choice leads to the film-memory, which yields the conceptual answer and the altered stance at the end. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “where unused love is stored,” with the cost manifesting as relinquishment and acceptance. The arc is more contemplative than pressured, but for this mode it coheres effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: orientation is immediate (Elara, archway, aurora, astrolabe), and the story progresses through a single ritual scene that deepens rather than scatters. Tracing the meteors builds toward a clear closure unit—an earned stasis/resonant reconfiguration when she accepts “Rest” and releases the struggle against her block. Causality is simple but coherent: grief → blockage → ritual → memories → reframed understanding → release. The cost—accepting ongoing grief as part of creativity—is legible, though the external situation remains static and entirely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walking → locating an unlit hollow → performing the charm → perceiving ripples → recommitting to the journey. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, particularly with the chess clock’s meaning shifting from tombstone to seed and his role evolving from guard to gardener. Causality at the lyric scale is coherent—each step follows logically and deepens rather than resets. The main limitation is that pressure change is subtle; the outcome is never seriously in doubt once the charm begins.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the gear → sensory divination → journey → activation of the obsidian tree → quiet reconfiguration of his stance. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands with an earned stasis as he accepts his ongoing translocations without fear. The stakes are mostly internal and somewhat abstract, and the path to resolution offers no real uncertainty once the socket-match appears. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: leash breaks → guided meander → cumulative wisdom → realization at the ridgeway’s heart, with closure landing in Elara’s inward revaluation of courage (a clear Conceptual Repricing under an accumulative/textural lens). Causality is simple but coherent—each detour leads to another star, another layer of understanding, and finally to the heart of the ridgeway and her internal shift. The vigil frame (twilight, ticket, ferry guides) is introduced early and returns at the end with the glowing central star. Stakes stay mostly internal and abstract, but the before/after line is legible and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: avalanche → guilt-ridden routine → discovery of the discolored stone → secret chamber → decision to expose and memorialize rather than hide. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she does not change jobs or world-rules, but her stance toward silence and safety irrevocably shifts with visible cost. Structure stays within one coherent arc and the final acts (leaving the door open, placing the bolt) materially close the initial moral wound. The only limitation is that external resistance never manifests, making the final choice somewhat unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Valerius’s original use of the corrupted rune strands Kael, Kael develops the temporal message tactic, and those messages culminate in Elara’s courtroom exposure and the collapse of both false reign and library. Closure lands with a clear before/after (pretender unmasked; Kael and the Athenaeum dissolve), and the cost is explicit. However, much of the key action (Elara’s investigation, political risk, and court dynamics) happens in summary rather than scene, muting immediacy and pressure at the climax. The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative/lyric overlay, but escalation feels foregone rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense monitoring scene, interleaved memory, then a causal pivot when the sacred rhythm triggers the buried AI key and recorded message. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s role and the station’s function shift from passive monitoring of loss to active curation of memory, with grief as the cost. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—patterns of rhythm and silence accrue until a single action (the key rhythm) unlocks new options. The one soft spot is slight reliance on the AI’s expository text block for thematic articulation, which dulls some structural subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: single scene, one POV, pressure building via movement toward the circle and intensifying hum, closing on a reweighted understanding of the lull. Causality is simple but intact: he follows a whispered method to answer a clear need, the ritual changes his internal stance, which in turn clarifies his future action. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the lull becomes “vital margin,” and his mission shifts from vengeance to carrying serenity back, with a conceptual cost (accepting pause over action). There are no orientation issues or broken setups; the only limit is that external stakes remain mostly offstage and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → glyphs → pine’s prompting → amber → decision to unseal → eruption of the Silvershade Fern → communal, thematic resolution. Closure is strong and legible as a decisive change with cost, reconfiguring the role of tradition and Elara’s relationship to it. Structure is linear and well-contained in a single scene, with no orientation issues and one clear tightening when she rejects the “innocent child” requirement. The only thing keeping it out of the very top band is that the risk and consequence around defying the prophecy feel conceptually important but are not strongly tested or resisted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: gull-triggered freeze → deliberate grounding → reframed relationship to the photo and lighthouse → earned stasis at the end. Causality within this interior arc holds, and the closure beat (photograph now a testament, not a trigger) lands with a visible before/after. That said, most of the piece remains in a single emotional register without a distinctly marked hinge scene; the “plot” is more an extended meditation than a pressured progression. For elite venues, the lack of a sharper mid-story turn or complication keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: touching the thread fractures reality, prompting the descent, the untangling, and the redesign that restores the world. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is precise from the first paragraph, and the cellar web is a clear locus of climax. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: reality stabilizes, but Kael must live with ongoing “luminescent ache” rather than escape. The only soft spot is how quickly and completely a vast cosmic weave is restored, which slightly reduces the sense of arduous struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: eclipse experience → obsession → restored drone → accidental ink spill → pattern recognition → drone disappearance → conceptual realization → renunciation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “time slowing” with a concrete cost (losing the drone and choosing not to reclaim it). Structurally it’s a single, coherent scene with pressure that tightens once; the only drawback is the slightly didactic exposition of the insight rather than letting action/image carry more of that load.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the letter → weighing of protocol vs. conscience → exploiting dormant networks → interruption threat → decisive transmission. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s founding myth is about to be shattered, and her professional safety is implicitly at risk. The scene stays in one continuous, well-oriented window and escalates coherently under a causal lens with no orientation debt. Consequences are projected rather than partially tasted on-page, which slightly blunts the sense of immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene in the dome with interleaved backstory about the tower’s fall and the father’s legacy, all clearly oriented and easy to follow. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repetition of the knife ritual and the tending of roses build toward a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. However, there is minimal sense of before/after change; the closure mainly restates an existing stance rather than decisively reconfiguring options. The causal spine is intact, but the arc risks feeling static at this length for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: entering at the sacred hour → traversing escalating sonic danger → using the spike and voiced silence → channeling grief at the vortex → being reconfigured by the echo. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with strong textural accumulation), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual shift from “catching” to “being remade by” the echo. Cost is legible—she gives up the hunter’s stance and reopens old grief in order to gain a different kind of connection. Structure is tight and single-scene; there are no loose setups or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s call → decision to test the official story → discovery of shutter and weather contradictions → personal clue → reclassification of death and choice to publish, with no orientation issues. The proof-by-contradiction structure gives the piece a tight skeleton, and the closure unit—a decisive reframing of Alistair’s “accident” and a commitment to print the truth—lands clearly. The cost of that closure, however, is handled rather gently and abstractly, with minimal on-page friction about family fallout, which limits the depth of the final turn. Still, the piece offers a solid decisive change with a clear before/after in knowledge and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → understanding of tethering → recognition of the cry’s signature → act of humming with the amber → resolution of the haunted firmware. Closure lands as a decisive change (the chime, time smoothing) coupled with a reconfiguration of her relationship to guilt and sound. The brief vision-tapestry of time integrates smoothly as a single intensifying shard rather than a digressive detour. Stakes and cost are legible at the end, though the solution arrives without any serious risk of failure or alternative strategy explored.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: shard whisper → resolve → mandala construction → emergent hush → anxious counter-whisper → verbal interjection → integrated stillness. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she crosses a threshold from anxious “unlearning” into carrying the “emergent hush” as a compass, with leaving the grotto and pocketing the shard marking a clear before/after. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than external but legible—the relinquishing of pure erasure in favor of the more demanding work of integration. The structure never confuses orientation or lens, though the arc’s safety keeps it just shy of truly shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from desolate plaza and trapped trauma to the deliberate act of renaming and the audible sign of social shift (children’s laughter). The closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: “Ashen Square” becomes “Sanctuary of Echoes,” and her trauma reframes from chains to compass points with a clear before/after. Causality is coherent (her method and intent lead directly to the act and its effect), though opposition is largely remembered rather than present, keeping the on-page cost more internal and conceptual than contested. The narrative window is tight and legible with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—echo production → cord weaving → temporal alignment → Julian’s appearance → Elara’s release—reads coherent and purposeful, with each step flowing from the last under a textural/accumulative lens. Closure is strong: Elara achieves a resonant reconfiguration by safeguarding the possibility in the garden and relinquishing her tether, with clear emotional cost. There are no orientation issues: who, where, and the magical rules are legible early and remain consistent. The conflict shape is smooth rather than sharply turned, which modestly limits the perception of structural brilliance at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: static shock → somatic activation/geode → decision to paint via bodily cues → exposure → reveal of image → reconfiguration of Elara’s stance. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step narrowing from abstract concept (telepathy pill recall) to concrete act (following somatic markers). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s role shifts from skeptic technician to guide of “embodied truth,” with the cost being a softening of her certainty. The only slight weakness is that the pill recall is explained rather than dramatized, feeling like an expository insert rather than a fully integrated turn.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Elara follows an emotional heat cue, discovers the fossil, experiences a miracle, maps it, and then embeds fossil and map for future humans, landing in a clear RR/CR closure. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, with each step deepening the central stake of preserving felt knowledge for the sleepers, and orientation is strong from the opening. The main limitation is that cost and constraint at the ending are conceptually present but lightly dramatized, so the before/after legible shift is more thematic than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the crack, the canyon echo, and the button mosaic build toward a conceptual reconfiguration of the prophecy. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—her long practice with buttons enables the deciphering; the released echo reframes “collapse” as a call for communal attention. Closure lands with a clear before/after: prophecy as sentence vs. cipher, passive countdown vs. activated community. The cost of this reframing (what she risks or must give up) remains mostly conceptual, keeping the piece just shy of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: one continuous scene accumulating pressure from solitary ritual to shared confrontation, with Anya’s arrival as the major tightening. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: his goal brings him to the bluff, the snow-code and pillbox ritual prepare his stance, and the unexpected re-entry of Anya forces that stance into an on-page choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship and his self-concept shift when he hands over the box and accepts the thaw. The cost—risking rejection and relinquishing the pillbox-as-escape—is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—sitting in the fog listening to the gutters while memory and meaning reconfigure—holds cleanly to a single lens and location. The live clock of the rain gutters and the final *plink* provide a precise, on-page closure moment where his stance toward the promise decisively changes. Causality in a textural sense is coherent: present sensations cue specific memories which in turn reweight the present and alter his choice about how to carry the vow. Quiet scope limits the sense of broader cost, but the before/after line is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present ritual → vision of layered timelines → post-vision reorientation, with clear causal linkage (sun angle and glass produce vision; vision reconfigures his purpose). The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing of kindness as temporally consequential. Closure is solid: he leaves physically unchanged but internally reweighted, carrying the oasis “within him” as a cost-bearing stance. Stakes and cost are modestly scaled to contemplation rather than crisis, which suits the piece but keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the last petal falls, the ritual of light begins, Mateo’s witness intensifies its meaning, and dawn closes the window. Under a textural drive lens, the “quivering hush” of the city that she answers with her oar-rhythm light functions as a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis. Causality is modest but coherent—each step grows logically from the prior one, with no orientation issues or broken set-ups. The cost is quiet (fatigue, seasonal waiting, acceptance of smallness) but legible in her warmed shoulder and the ritual’s once-per-cycle framing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: reincarnation memory → search for understanding → ritual with sundial and stone circle → vision → decision to become a steward and writer. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the embedded vision is clearly cued and returned from. Closure lands as a decisive change in stance with visible cost—she accepts a solitary guardian role rather than seeking external validation—and the world’s rules hold together. The arc is somewhat straightforward, with no major surprise or structural risk, but it is tightly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: storm → twig spiral → idea → building → communal use → realization and personal offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she conceptually “finds the thread” and then pays a small but clear emotional cost by placing “home” into the spiral’s heart. The single-scene continuity and focus on one evolving installation keep orientation and stakes legible. The main limitation is that the causal chain unfolds with little friction or complication, so the decisive change is emotionally significant but not heavily contested.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a primarily causal lens, the structure is clean: cosmic manipulation → Aris’s long-prepared plan → memo raising the cost → midnight alignment and broadcast → partial relief → Croft’s approach as a closing pressure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he has altered the situation (trickster signal suppressed, campus de-escalated) and now faces institutional consequences. The cause-and-effect of the subsonic interference on the quad is clear, if a bit convenient and unresisted by the antagonistic forces. A slightly more contested or complicated payoff would push this toward the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is clean: entering the nexus → spatial mutiny escalates → journal clue cues the organ → playing resolves the mutiny and reveals the Chronos Key. The story maintains a single continuous scene with clear geography and a legible, earned resolution that closes both the external quest and the internal fear-conflict. Cost is present in her forced progression through the most confined point (the loft) to gain the key. The resolution comes a bit smoothly—there’s no real failure beat or complication once the organ is found—but closure remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: a cold case leads to the quarry, tactile searching leads to the carving, which yields the niche and journal, culminating in a reconfigured understanding of Clara. Orientation in who/where/when is early and firm, and the piece honors a single-scene frame without temporal confusion. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s mission shifts from reconstructing a missing woman to honoring a chosen freedom, with on-page evidence in the journal and final vow. The convenience of the perfectly preserved journal is a minor credulity stretch but doesn’t fracture the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: anomalous weather → nail/ink match → decoding → revelation of Aris’s choice → recognition of matching conditions → confrontation → verification → evacuation → tsunami. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: station destroyed, lives saved, and Aris’s legacy conceptually restored, with clear costs. Structure is linear and well-contained within a single escalating sequence, appropriate for the length. The technician’s relatively swift acceptance of her evidence feels slightly convenient, but not enough to break plausibility or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: hitchhiker encounter → artifact left behind → perceptual pattern in scaffolds → experimental playing → reframed mission, all in one continuous window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward his “bridge-songs” and his past loss is clearly different by the end, with the pullout redefined as “threshold of rebirth.” Causality under a magical-realist logic is consistent, especially the recounting that triggers the glass flake’s glow and his choice to play. The cost is mostly implied (relinquishing elegiac identity) rather than sharply foregrounded, keeping this just below elite-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single coherent scene where Leo returns to the train post-failure, encounters Kai, reframes their shared past, and ends with a meaningful act of relinquishment, which provides on-page closure. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: the setting and conversation lead to Leo’s realization and his choice to leave the money. Cost is present but largely symbolic and internal, leaning more toward conceptual repricing than decisive change, which suits the mode but keeps tension modest. No orientation issues or broken setups, though the arc is very smooth, with few genuine turns.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: months of work → exhaustion and stuckness → symbolic telegram from Kael → re-interpretation of Mira’s dimming → conceptual revaluation of the inscriptions and her role. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: the same labor is re-understood as a shared covenant rather than a solitary test. The structure (one night, embedded memories/dreams) is tight and appropriate to the length, with no orientation debt. The only minor limitation is that external stakes stay modestly scaled to her psyche; everything important happens in her head and on the page of her journal.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: failed scrying → decision to use the seed → ritual of expanding circles → revelation of the frozen younger self → confession and acceptance, all in one continuous scene. Orientation is strong from the first lines; who/where/what are quickly clear, and the magical logic stays internally consistent. Closure lands as a decisive internal turn with visible external corollary (lake and orchard transformed, armor traded for openness). The main limitation is that the external problem (the curse/lake) yields without much resistance once the correct ritual is chosen, so structural tension never quite tightens to the highest pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: shattered covenant → chaotic visions → Elara uses scars and the clipping to navigate → confronts and heals the rift. The story maintains a single, continuous scene with legible stakes and a clear, on-page closure where the rift is mended and the covenant renewed via the sapling. Cost is present (pain, surrendering the clipping, shouldering “only beginning” work) but remains mostly conceptual and gently delivered. Structure is tight and coherent, though the outcome feels somewhat assured once her method is established, with little real doubt of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: he arrives with the burned card, performs the ritual, absorbs the sorrow, and leaves, with each step causally linked and legible. Closure is strong as a resonant reconfiguration—the card’s transformation and his acceptance of sorrow clearly mark a before/after with cost. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal throughline (card → invocation → wisp → transfer) still holds. What keeps it below top-tier is the relative lack of complication or disruption mid-ritual; once started, nothing seriously threatens failure or forces new tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clear and effective: present shame → ritual of facts → memory incursion → revaluation of his career → concrete new path, all under a single POV and continuous frame. Causality is intact and legible—today’s public failure directly precipitates the crisis and reorientation—and the box/scrap function as a clean hinge into the memory shard. Closure lands on the page with a real before/after: he renounces one professional path and commits to another, with visible cost and relief. The drive lens reads as predominantly causal with an accumulative textural layer, and that hybrid holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: failed observation → despair → analogical leap via the tablet → planting the seed → new magnetic signature → redefinition of his life’s work. The scene stays in one tight window “after the spirit leaves,” and closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis where he relinquishes his old goal. Cost is present: thirty years of ambition are reframed rather than rewarded. The structure is straightforward and perhaps a touch too neatly resolved, but it’s solidly built for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece clearly teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern: tide comes in, identities gather, she smelts contradictions, shelves results, resets the ritual. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her role and the paradox-embracing process crystallize, with the crescent moon and “vessel of hope” image tying it off. Still, structural pressure is gentle; there is no tightening constraint beyond the cyclical ritual itself, so the before/after hinge feels more like a refined tableau than a true inflection with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: a single continuous ritual sequence where each beat (arrival, discovery of the shell, reading confessions, crowning with the pearl) follows clearly and deepens pressure. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is firm—each sensory or symbolic detail increments toward the decisive act of placing the pearl in the shell. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the act redefines “apocalypse,” shifts his vocation, and carries a legible emotional cost in relinquishing the pearl. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a single, coherent pilgrimage scene with a clear before/after: she arrives to “document” and leaves with her map discarded and her stance reconfigured. Causality is accumulative rather than event-twisty, but each move (entering, reading graffiti, playing the accordion, leaving the map) follows believably from the last. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: mapping gives way to “breath” and practice, with visible cost in relinquishing the old frame. No orientation issues or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → decoding the library’s mechanics → recognition of the watch’s role → personal emotional turn → spoken closure. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; the library’s behavior, the watch, and her decision to write all build toward the final spoken word. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines her role in relation to silence with a visible before/after. The only limitation is that the looming “second letter” remains an offstage stake that never quite tests her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: observatory and artifact → coffee-stain futures → stark binary (Archive or sacrifice) → musical act → propagation and loss, with no missing links. Orientation is clean early—who, where, when, and what’s at stake are all legible—and the pattern (lyric but linear) is taught and maintained. Closure is a decisive change with cost: the violin is destroyed to save the mulberry line, and the before/after is unambiguous. The only constraint keeping this below 9+ is that empire/Archive pressure remains entirely off-stage, so the external side of the choice is more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: establish vow and vessel, build toward the “threshold of stillness,” execute the infusion, then close with the vial and descent. Causality is coherent and linear—each beat follows from the prior one, with the aurora’s stilling and the mandala providing a clear hinge. Closure lands as a completed rite that preserves a spark against oblivion, with the cost framed as the emotional and metaphysical weight of that work. The piece lacks surprise or complication, but within a lyric mode the structure is solid and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: climb tree → contemplative choice → ritual carving, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where contentment is found in present texture. Causality under this lens holds—each step arises organically from her role and motivation, and the closure (new scallop, new stance toward forgiveness) is explicit. The cost, while present, is gentle and somewhat abstract, limiting the impact of the before/after contrast. Orientation is strong from the outset, and there are no structural stumbles, but escalation of consequence is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and causal: conversation and sensory cues build to two decisive acts (unhooking the cloak and dropping the shard) that clearly mark a before/after. The global drive is causal with thematic coloration, and the closure carries emotional cost in Kael’s relinquishment of a long-held self-story. The arc is perhaps a touch neat, but the sequence of beats is coherent and earned within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene where each step (settling, casting the stone, reading rings, recognizing the spiral) feeds naturally into the next realization. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via patterns and images rather than discrete plot turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aris reinterprets his research as fundamentally about love and recommits to his withholding strategy with clarified intent, which carries an emotional cost. The stakes remain modestly internal, but there are no causality or orientation slips, and the ending feels like a true “after” to the opening “before.”

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: environment and lore → bird arrival → bifurcation revelation → Corbin’s harmonic intervention → reconfigured canyon. Causality is legible within a lyric frame (bird pattern → realization about the Pulse → humming the First Song → Pulse reunified, Corbin transformed), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with Corbin as anchor. Cost is present but subtle: he forecloses physical journeying and subsumes himself into the canyon’s function. The largely resistance-free progression—no real risk that this might fail—keeps the structural tension from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: guild dismissal → ascent → keystone encounter → return and moonflower epilogue. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she refuses the literal objective, redefines success, and her life trajectory shifts toward sacred simplicity with a clear before/after. The quest itself is somewhat low-resistance—no real obstacles to reaching or interacting with the keystone—which slightly softens the sense of ordeal. Still, each step tightens the thematic logic, and the cost of her choice (remaining out of step with the automated guild) is legible in the quiet but pointed final scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: lamplighter → tide-revealed wreck → key matches chest → logbook reveals luminous vows → emotional breakthrough → symbolic renunciation and return. The story uses a single continuous excursion with one major structural turn at the logbook discovery and an earned resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure is clear and on-page: his worldview and self-protective strategy shift with visible emotional cost. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities; the only ceiling is that external obstacles are minimal, so the structural tension rests almost entirely on the internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the present-tense vigil, the static bursts, the ritual of casting lots, and the “backwards prophecy” all build toward a reconfiguration of what prophecy and purpose mean at the heat-death end-state. Causality within this lyric, situational frame is coherent: doubt → ritual (coins) + method (static listening) → distilled tone → clarified purpose. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she chooses to endure as witness, relinquishing any fantasy of altering fate, and that before/after is legible. The main limitation is that the narrative arc feels more like a confirmation than a genuine turn; nothing in the world or her options truly changes, only her articulation of the same path.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual scene that escalates through three crystallizations to the climactic naming of the deepest fear, with causal links (“Hours earlier…” → wax cylinders → present ritual) that are legible and satisfying. The global drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone: each naming deepens the emotional stakes and prepares for the final, decisive fear. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s role and his relationship to Elara’s sacrifice reweight from hollow grief to purposeful legacy, with cost made explicit in his tears and the “goodbye he never properly spoke.” The only limitation is that external constraints and alternative outcomes are lightly sketched, so the path feels fated rather than genuinely precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: careful preparation → drip experiment → accumulating resonance → bell restoration → sea’s answer, with the “understanding dripping rates” method tightly integrated from early setup to closure. The story maintains one continuous scene, clear temporal progression, and a well-defined global drive (causal with accumulative texture), and the closure beat—bell chiming, fish leaping, covenant reignited—lands on the page with a felt, if quiet, cost (ongoing repetition, long labor). The only limitation is that opposition or potential failure remains largely theoretical; nothing complicates or meaningfully endangers the plan once it starts working.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: wind chime silence → descent to exposed town → confrontation with memory → choice to preserve against orders → future-oriented plan, all in one continuous scene with a short flashback. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (her reorientation from levee warden to memory-weaver with a concrete next step) lands on the page. The cost—defying the spirit of the directive and reopening buried grief—is legible if understated. There are no major unkept setups or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and causal: dilemma → observation of starlings → reimagined method → successful transformation, all within a single continuous scene. Orientation (who/where/what she’s doing) is solid very early, and the global drive reads as Hybrid with an accumulative lyric surface over a simple causal spine. Closure clearly lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—she exits with an integrated self and a transformed crystal. Stakes and cost (“irreversible fracture”) are stated but never quite tested or tightened into a concrete near-loss, which keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: static → anomaly in the Serpent constellation → realization the initial log is flawed → inventive use of the arbor → solemn revision and report. The causal chain holds, and the closure—trust restored and the buckle re-signified—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear before/after. Stakes stay modest and interior, but the piece doesn’t promise more than it delivers. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities, and the quiet ending feels properly cadenced.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear progression from approach → ritual → emergence → reconfiguration of stakes. Closure is strong under an accumulative/causal lens: Kaela’s choice to embrace numbness as a partner directly yields vivification and her own transformation, with visible emotional cost. The “clone custody battle” and galactic context feel more like framing than active plot, and they are dismissed rather than tested, which slightly undercuts the external stakes. Still, for this length, the internal arc lands coherently and decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious seed arrival → symbolic interpretation → planting and vow → design work → time-lapse payoff with the sprout and renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds, and the closure works as a resonant reconfiguration where his approach to innovation is reaffirmed and deepened. The time jump is handled smoothly, and orientation is never in doubt. The main limitation is that the structural turns don’t sharply narrow options or impose concrete consequences; they feel contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: set-up of loss and ritual, descent and activation, the moment of impossible laughter, and a reconfigured quiet at the end. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—his method produces a charged, perhaps supernatural result, which then alters the house’s emotional state. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the house and parents are subtly changed, with a visible cost in his ongoing commitment to return. Stakes remain intimate but feel sufficiently tightened around the child-echo moment and its aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: we move from static vigil to the pendant-activated rift, to a single, decisive refusal, all under a stable POV and temporal window. Causality is coherent and legible (pendant → light → rift → decision), and the closure beat delivers a clear before/after with cost. The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative, and the ending’s Earned Stasis is fully present on the page; the only constraint is that escalation is almost entirely internal, giving the arc a narrow but well-executed range.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain from preparation to realization to transformation and a decisive before/after in identity and object. Closure is strong—the staff exists, her role is reconfigured, and the path of servitude is genuinely foreclosed. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and it holds consistently. Stakes remain largely internal and could be sharpened with more concrete external consequence if she fails again.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at Spire Seven → ritual tuning → progressive shedding of assumptions → internal “frequency” discovery → redefined role. Causality holds at every step, and the closure—her remaining as a listener, with the shard fused to the dial—is a clear resonant reconfiguration with before/after legibility. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays consistent, and there’s a felt conceptual cost in relinquishing the chase for grand, decipherable messages. The piece is quiet but fully coherent; what’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of constraint or loss at the moment of fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: anomaly onset on the ferry, transition into the grotto, the hourglass choice, and return to normalcy form a coherent causal chain. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with some lyric accumulation, and the closure (ferry restored, Leo altered in stance) is unambiguous. The major weakness is how swiftly he intuits the starlight map and the hourglass’s function, which softens the sense of earned resolution and makes the mechanics feel convenient. Still, orientation is excellent throughout and the before/after is legible with a modest conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: calm ritual → subtle dissonance → thread revolt → memory eruption → reconfigured stance. Causality is soft but coherent: the gallery’s long-term practice and today’s dissonance plausibly catalyze a tipping point rather than a random miracle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing of her project, with a visible before/after in how she vows to weave “open invitations, born of consent and mutual respect.” The one weakness is that the triggering of the eruption leans a bit on mystical spontaneity rather than a clearly dramatized choice or threshold action from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single teaching demonstration where Kael uses the chain link and scanner to reconfigure how his students perceive navigation, culminating in Lyra’s internal shift. Causality is straightforward and intact—Kael’s choice of method prompts Lyra’s doubt, the demonstration, and her reorientation—and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of their world (“I no longer feel buried, I feel oriented”). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with pattern-building in imagery and ideas rather than big reversals. The main limitation is that cost and stakes remain mostly conceptual, with little sense that anything might fail or be lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear setup (artifact + calling hour), development (listening and decoding), and closure (delivering the message and the atrium’s response). Cause-and-effect holds, but pressure is soft; the social worker’s perfectly timed entrance feels convenient rather than earned escalation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Lily is comforted, and the atrium’s fabric strengthens—but the cost is relatively low and mostly conceptual. The accumulative/textural drive is coherent but never truly tightens into a “no going back” moment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: descent → discovery of the Array → activation via codex → revelation of the message → tidal threat and escape, all linked by clear because/therefore logic. Orientation (who/where/why) is established early and maintained, with the tidal window and facility layout staying coherent. Closure is solid: he succeeds in witnessing and preserving his grandfather’s work at genuine risk, and the before/after in his relationship to the space and legacy is legible. The main limitation is that external complications remain fairly simple, with no major structural surprise or secondary turn beyond the returning tide.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual progression: arrival in the observatory → engagement with the “digital ghost” → ink ritual → insight → reconfigured status and mission. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step thickens rather than twists causality, but the closure is clear: the ghost dissolves, protocols are changed, and her life record is “verified, safeguarded.” Cost is legible in the emotional release and in the decision to transform trauma into outward-facing work. Nothing crucial is left unresolved, and the before/after is conceptually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: observing the flock, entering the tunnel, mapping textures to sounds, culminating in the word and the diamond’s flare. Causality within this ritual frame is coherent, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where language shifts from latent texture to echoing sound—is on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual (centuries of silence, the burden of being last) rather than felt through reversals or setbacks. Still, the before/after of the language’s status is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: undercover mission → witnessing the static ritual → metamorphosis → revaluation of the cryptid and her own purpose → decisive choice to protect. Structure holds to a single, continuous scene with no orientation or lens issues, and the flint arrowhead and phone both pay off. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing of “static” and “hope,” with implied cost to Aris’s career and prior identity. The only limit is that external consequences remain mostly implied rather than partially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: heart-aligned music → orchard stirs → statues crack → decision to descend → uprooting vines → monolith shatters → orchard rebirth. The single-scene structure with one transition (bridge to grove’s heart) is tight and easy to follow, with clear orientation from the outset. Closure lands decisively with the orchard’s liberation and Elara’s reframed playing, and there is an on-page cost in effort and risk, though resistance is lighter than the build-up suggests (the statues never truly test her). The drive lens reads as primarily causal with strong lyric inflection, held consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: the sacred mail-drop routine, the appearance of the patrol drone, the deliberate deployment of the storm, and the covert drone launch all link coherently. Orientation (who/where/when) is early and strong, and the single-scene frame is well-contained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration more than a decisive change: he completes the mission and leaves with reweighted purpose and a charged arcade, which works at this length. The main weakness is that the cost of the operation stays mostly hypothetical, so the final beat feels slightly less sharp than its set-up promises.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a wrong turn → discovery of the train → discovery of the horse/halo → memory of Lily → song and restoration → re-emergence into a renewed landscape. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward silence and her future is clearly different by the end, with visible cost in reopening her voice and grief. The drive lens is predominantly accumulative/textural but maintains enough causal throughline that the ending feels earned, though the external landslide incitement is purely coincidental and never re-enters the pressure calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a present ritual in the library triggering a childhood memory that reconfigures her understanding—reads as a clean accumulative/textural design. Causality is coherent: scarf + chart + focus → reawakening → realization, with no orientation issues. Closure lands via conceptual repricing: the “place” of stories shifts from external archive to relational dimension, with a clear before/after. The cost is subtle (renouncing her long quest for an external locus) rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: preparation → ascent → sunrise capture → darkroom revelation → internal reconfiguration, all cleanly causal. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the failed external quest resolves into an internal understanding that reweights every prior ritual. The cost—ten years of longing and the painful realization that she cannot retrieve the exact courtyard, only its essence—is present but understated on the page. A bit more friction or the risk of failure in the central attempt would deepen the sense of stakes and elevate this toward elite-level structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single ritualized scene at the nexus, causally linked to Elara’s distant release, with a clear before/after (idea imprisoned vs. freed). The drive lens reads as hybrid but closure is fundamentally causal: he follows the star’s hint, uses the relic, speaks the words, and the world reconfigures. The cost is legible in Elara’s half-century of accumulated fear and in the scale of what’s being risked conceptually, even if the on-page process offers little real resistance. All set-ups (star, keystone, hair, fear as architecture) pay off without contradiction or dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritualized investigation in the present with a single, clearly cued memory shard in the middle. Causality is tight—Elara’s journal → specific method (broken constellations) → alignment → memory return → reframed relationship to the place. Closure is strong and legible: his drive (recover the stolen night) is fulfilled with cost and yields a decisive change in stance (“the habit of avoidance was broken forever”). There are no orientation issues; time (“decades later”) is used as a brief coda rather than a disruptive jump.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is structurally clean: one continuous scene, coherent pressure, and a clear closure beat in Elara’s decision to annotate her own hope. Cause-and-effect is solid under a situational/accumulative lens—Kael’s method leads to her attempt, to recognition of the spiral, to the inscription of “Return.” The library, swing, and glass-shadow recur to underline the before/after without overcomplicating the frame. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, which keeps the piece from feeling fully climactic, but the reconfiguration of her stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: present-moment parapet → crossing into the in-between → weaving essences → returning with an altered seed → recharged orchard image. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the sequence of moves is easy to track under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the infused seed plus the final bud’s gold-green hint reframes the orchard as a site of future resistance to grayness. The main weakness is the lack of any structural complication or test that might threaten the ritual, so cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure—knot by knot, memory by memory—builds cleanly toward the final revelation of the fisherman’s sacrifice, with each released knot logically following from the last. The single-scene ritual is easy to track spatially and temporally, and the closure beat (spirits grounded, Elara’s understanding reconfigured) lands clearly with emotional cost. The causal thread is soft but coherent: unraveling → memory revealed → silence thickens → spirits release → Elara’s repricing of restoration. A touch more genuine resistance or risk around the final knot could further sharpen the sense of structural climax.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and coherent: months of prior work, present-tense investigation, and a single chain of discoveries leading to conceptual closure. Causality within an accumulative/lyric lens holds: film restoration → split-screen playback → shadow discrepancy → overlay with map and fresco → re-interpretation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the chapel/henge and the torn map, with a clear before/after in understanding. The piece does, however, lean heavily on exposition of process rather than dramatized obstacles, which keeps the structural pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: descend to the wreck → find globe and tape → painstaking restoration → play the last transmission → interior reconfiguration, all under a single POV and coherent timeframe. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each concrete action (discovering the globe, untangling tape, hearing Evans) deepens the central question rather than introducing new plotlines. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing/RR—his stance toward grief and “letting go” is clearly different by the end, with the stone in his chest settling. The cost (relinquishing his clinging to Elara’s voice) is legible, even if dramatized quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—waiting between lightning and thunder, the sequence of encoded symbols, then the cut to citywide effects—forms a coherent arc with a clear before/after. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: once the thunder hits, the code’s effects radiate outward and Elara feels “more heard,” which conceptually reprices her earlier solitude. Causality is soft but legible within the poetic frame; nothing crucial teleports or contradicts itself. The main limitation is the low visible price for success, which keeps the closure emotionally gentler than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single elevator ascent frames the discovery, the diary reading, and the internal shift, with clear causal beats (light → goggles → decryption → realization). The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of joy versus anguish tied to Kael’s grief. Cost is present but modest—he confronts emotional pain rather than changing external options. Everything tracks, but escalation is gentle enough that the ending, while resonant, doesn’t feel structurally inevitable in a high-stakes sense.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: the tether snap isolates Aris, the cloud-cataloguing proceeds in a legible pattern, and the fallstreak hole functions as a structural and emotional pivot. Causality is simple but coherent—each observation is a step in the proof and in the grief process, culminating in the recognition that the void itself holds Elara’s imprint. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: absence is redefined as presence, and the experiment’s thesis is validated with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure from the outset, and there are no causality breaks or unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single scene under demolition pressure, with a clear inciting detail (odd book spine), discovery (coin), realization, and exit as the building falls. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, with the coin’s pattern triggering a conceptual repricing that reconfigures her relationship to her work. Closure is on the page and carries cost: she leaves without looking back as the tree is destroyed. A slight sense of inevitability in the middle (the safe reveals exactly what she needs thematically) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dimmed aether-lamp → solitary research → starling pattern → phrasebook clue → hopscotch cipher → emergency orb → ship restored. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid very early, and the scene proceeds in a coherent, single-POV throughline to a decisive on-page change. Closure is satisfying but low-cost; once the pattern appears, the solution unfolds with minimal resistance or risk, so the structural arc feels more like elegant puzzle-solving than pressured choice. No major set-ups go unkept, but escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal skeleton is clean: need to repair → search prophecy → reach hall → uncap and diagnose → replace and reframe understanding. The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens, but the event chain is still legible and each step grows out of the last without teleporting props or rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the clock is mended, and her conception of “repair” shifts in a way that clearly changes the value of her goal. The only limit is that external obstacles are minimal and the operation proceeds with few concrete complications, so tension in the midsection is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: mysterious blight → recurring dawn messages → instruction to reexamine the bell → discovery of star charts → nebula alignment plan → mirror setup → bell activation → purification and Elara’s exit. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the story maintains a clear temporal and spatial throughline. Closure is strong under a causal lens: the world-state and relational dynamic change decisively when the orchard is healed and Elara relinquishes guardianship. The main weakness is the near-frictionless execution of the plan—no real setback or complication once the key is discovered—so escalation feels somewhat straightforward rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern quickly (ritual ascent, cosmic machinery, then escalating metaphysical operations) and maintains it cleanly. Causality is coherent: doomsday clock → pane of hush → lullaby channeled through fractal light → universe ends in “gentle folding” reconfigured by her act. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: time ends, but the universe’s death is reweighted as a cradle for the lullaby, with real cost signaled by “Dawn would not come.” The only limit is that the on-page process is largely frictionless—no significant risk of failure or unintended consequence complicates the linear march toward success.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: missing nut → search → retrieval from the Sentinel Tree → assembly → whistle → birds mark path → family escapes → Elara opts to continue despite cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with situational pressure from time and curse rules, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to this draining role for another day. There are no glaring plot amnesias or teleporting props, though the confrontation with the Sentinel Tree is resolved very smoothly with little resistance, softening the climactic beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: observation of the ravine → chrysalis → recalled lab conflict → foam-tracing insight → decision to write a proposal and letter. Closure lands clearly as a conceptual repricing: divergence reframed as part of a resilient system, which drives his new course of action with a visible emotional cost (risking vulnerability and public crediting of Elara). Causality is intact, with the environment continually feeding his realization rather than arbitrary epiphany. The stakes and constraint of reaching out remain mostly conceptual, so the final turn is resonant but not deeply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: quiet opening, thickening sense of charged absence, decisive incision, radiant eruption, and conceptual realization, followed by external confirmation via the first customer. Causality holds—quantifying absence leads to incision, which triggers the moonlight and reconfigures her quest. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the “place where stories begin” is reframed as a gesture at the intersection of will and void, with cost implied in the courage to confront emptiness. While stakes remain intimate and philosophical, the structural cadence is well handled and fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: rain → tidal pool reading → dune excavation → contact with the pavilion → subsuming/remodeling the remorse → emotional reconfiguration of the fortress. The piece satisfies closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress “wakes lighter” and Aris now carries the transformed remorse. Structure is linear, with one coherent drive and no causality breaks or unkept setups. The dream prelude is efficient motivation, though the “thirty nights” motif could slightly better influence tactics rather than remain pure backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: Elara discovers an obstruction, uses her multilingual song to restore the mechanism, and the grain elevator talks resume, culminating in a quiet yet clear reconfiguration of the valley’s social fabric. Causality is legible and clean—cuckoo weight blocks Jupiter’s gear → tower silenced → she frees and blesses it → clock and talks restart—without stray setups. Closure lands on page via the resumed polyglot chorus and Elara’s reaffirmed calling, but the cost is relatively soft (no real risk of failure, no alternative path credibly foreclosed). Structurally it’s a single continuous beat that deepens rather than turns sharply, which works for lyric mode but keeps it shy of top-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a present-tense ritual that deepens through successive memory-visions and culminates in a reconfigured identity (Resonant Reconfiguration). Causality is coherent—arranging the mirror, focusing, and “modifying” perception each lead to more intense encounters, then to an integrated calm by the end. Closure lands: she enters as an engineer seeking transformation and exits as someone who has accepted the cost of being altered by others’ memories. The stakes remain purely internal and contemplative, but the before/after is legible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: doodle → decoded location → timed inversion → threshold → grotto → combinations → return, with a legible before/after anchored in her new knowledge. The piece uses a largely causal lens with some accumulative patterning (seeds, light, vigilance) and lands a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Cost is more conceptual than felt—she succeeds without jeopardy, loss, or trade-off beyond effort and time. Structure is tight and linear, but escalation tops out at “discovery,” not true crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene ritual: preparation, method, performance, and an on-page reconfiguration of silence at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each strum adds depth until the closure, where silence is “not broken; it was deepened,” a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact, with the insulator and cracks set up before they matter. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, so stakes land gently rather than with sharp consequence, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clear single-scene accumulative meditation anchored in the nexus, with backstory braided through concrete sensory triggers. Causality is modest but coherent: his arrival → listening/correlating → specific memory spikes → reframed understanding → departure with a new inner orientation. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: exile is reweighted from punishment to catalyst, with a felt though quiet cost in lost students and the silenced library. Stakes remain primarily conceptual and emotional, but they are legible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene framed by the pre-fireworks hush and the eventual explosions, with clear causal flow from clasp → resonator tuning → emotional inundation → future choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s world and Henderson’s situation are reweighted by the recovered silence and her new intention. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and that lens holds cleanly through the end. Stakes are modest but coherent, and there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: parcel → planting → ritual care → first scent → sprout → reframed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reinterprets both the odor and her ambition, with a clear before/after in how she relates to the seed. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with no orientation debt. The cost at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it below top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The quest structure is clean: Kael follows inversion-water and the arrow tip to the source, discovers its nature, and reorients his mission, with no orientation or causality breaks. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: he renounces harvesting and commits to protection and teaching. Still, the path from departure to discovery is almost frictionless—no serious setbacks or dilemmas challenge the goal—so the decisive change feels more contemplative than hard-won. As a result, the structure is elegant but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal drive is clean: survey → data → refined hypotheses → discovery of resonance → personal connection via Croft’s patch → recommendations and resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s understanding of singular convergence and his own role is reweighted, with clear implications for future action. However, the on-page stakes remain largely conceptual and procedural; he faces no concrete obstruction or dilemma that forces a difficult choice. As a result, the structure is strong and coherent but lacks that extra notch of narrative crunch that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive effectively: the ritual unfolds in a single, continuous scene, with each bell strike deepening the pattern toward a reconfigured silence at the end. Causality is clean—her preparation and alignment lead to striking the bell, which triggers the unfettering and the cavern’s transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush is redefined as fertile and joyful rather than empty, with Elara leaving changed and the cavern permanently altered. The conceptual cost (forty-day journey, physical exhaustion, the serious weight of the ritual) is present but not strongly dramatized as jeopardy, limiting the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric lens: he prepares the space, uncases and plays the flute, accesses the weave, confronts the fracture, and exits with a reconfigured purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the guardianship is over, but his purpose is renewed through a new definition of strength and listening. Stakes stay largely internal, but the before/after is legible and carries cost (he relinquishes the fantasy of repair and omnipotent guardianship). There are no orientation or causality breaks, though external pressure remains low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: emotional intensities stack until the collision of philosopher and poet personas creates a crisis that then resolves into a reconfigured stance. Causality inside the lyric frame is coherent—her use of the halo fragment amplifies empathy, triggers disorientation, and necessitates the search for a new conceptual model. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the “mathematics” becomes the dance rather than a cage, and her working method is reweighted. The cost (relinquishing control and pure analytical mastery) is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: walk → memory cue → pendant activates → seed germinates → inner reconfiguration → recommitment to journey, all under a consistent accumulative/causal lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s role re-prices from relic courier to bearer of wonder, with Elara’s absence conceptually reweighted as seed rather than void. The causal links are smooth if low on surprise, and the scene holds in one continuous window. The cost—relinquishing his prior hollow, duty-only stance and accepting the loneliness of mentorship—is present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival with a clear goal, methodical attempt, apparent confirmation, then the “shifted hush” and spiral reveal triggering a genuine conceptual turn. Causality holds—sunlight → prism → spiral → memory of Mrs. Gable → shattered assumption—and the ending offers a clear Conceptual Repricing of his theory. Stakes are modest but coherent, centered on his epistemology and self-concept, which suits the length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: raveling silence threatens, puzzle-edges suggest a new method, Elara chooses to weave her present into the tapestry, and in doing so sacrifices herself and the orchard. The structure is cleanly accumulative, with one main tightening when she decides to use her own tether and reality begins dissolving. Closure is on-page and costly: she becomes part of the message and the physical orchard is lost while its essence persists in art and a sapling. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds smoothly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: cataclysm → barter for silk → study of star-charts → descent into mine → ritual → planetary renewal and inner shift. The structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure unit when the arches reassemble and Kael’s understanding crystallizes. Cost is on the page via the sacrificed memory and the implied irreversibility of the bargain. What holds this below elite level is the lack of genuine complication or setback; once he descends, everything works on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine—shard → traversal of parallel bays → volatile nexus → intentional redirection → revelation → return—is coherent and satisfies closure as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the multiverse shifts are legible and patterned. The weave stabilizing once she chooses compassion edges toward symbolic convenience but is foreshadowed enough not to feel arbitrary. The ending clearly marks a before/after in her knowledge and stance, and that knowledge will shape future options.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: a single present-time ascent, discovery, ritual act, and descent, with backstory interleaved at clear sensory cues. The causal chain from lamp failure and Hemlock’s death to Elias’s decision to build the Phoenix Stack is legible and satisfying, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of guardianship. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, and under that lens the tightening via the Phoenix Stack works. Still, external stakes (the dark reefs and endangered ships) are not materially tested on the page, which slightly flattens structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: ascent → accidental laugh → storm ignition → deliberate steering → dawn shaped and cost accepted. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is calmer and subtly altered, and Kael has paid with solitude and vigilance. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural but with solid causal scaffolding; pressure builds through increasingly precise work with the wick and beam. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the before/after is legible and scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: a single contemplative scene whose spine is the sun’s movement toward the wing, culminating in a realizational closure beat. Causality is simple but coherent—she sets up the experiment, waits, the light transforms the wing, and that triggers her conceptual shift about stories and the donor heart. The closure (a resolved new purpose as “surface worthy of reflection”) is on-page and clearly before/after. Stakes remain modest and internal, but they are consistently held under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: backstory (three seasons of mapping dreams, the astronomer’s grief) is woven into a single present-tense ritual that culminates in the moonlight-triggered repair. Cause and effect under an accumulative/textural lens hold: mapped dreams → prepared sextant → precise moonlight moment → reconstitution → access to arboreal memory → redefined role. Closure is solid as a resonant reconfiguration: before, she tends the labyrinth hoping to understand trees; after, she has a working conduit and a new vocation, with a clear before/after axis. The main limitation is that the decisive “deconstruction” work is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, so the peak turn leans on prior effort more than on a present-tense choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene ritual that escalates from initial fragility (failing Heartseed, scattered memory) to successful rekindling of dawn, with each song-memory causally deepening the effect. The drive feels mainly accumulative/textural—songs, memories, and sensory detail build toward a threshold—but there is also clear causal linkage (song → Heartseed pulse → tools awakening → night shuddering → village response). Closure is strong: the realm’s status has changed, her role has crystallized, and the “century of vigil” feels truly closed, with concrete images (saffron threads, dewdrop sunrise) marking the turn. A small limitation is that opposition remains largely implicit/ambient, so the sense of risk to failure is more stated than structurally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: rediscovered invitation → decision to perform the ritual → projection to the gathering → new understanding of her role → recontextualization of her solitude. The structure is linear and easy to follow, anchored by the grandfather clock and the solstice gathering. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: she remains in the library but with a reconfigured stance toward hiding and community. The cost—ten years of self-exile and the choice not to descend in person even now—is legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: observation of loss → search for sanctuary → gardening ritual → bread revelation → reconfiguration of the crust’s meaning. Causality is coherent even in a lyric mode, and the closure—reframing the crust as compass and her role as keeper—lands on the page. The primary cost is subtle (living with loss rather than erasing it), but it is thematically consistent and legible at the end. The piece never truly tightens external options or introduces serious jeopardy, which keeps the structural stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from a single fading slide, through precise measurement and last flicker, to archival stasis and renewed commitment. Causality is clean—illusion decay → measurement attempt → final glimpse → permanent data → resumption of duty—and orientation (who/where/what-now) is solid from the outset. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elara continues the work in the face of ongoing loss, with the cost of each vow’s extinction legible in the “spent slide, now clear and cold.” The drive lens (accumulative) holds without contradiction, though the stakes are more philosophical than plot-tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s interventions repeatedly delay Silas, his frustration spikes into a public accusation, and her prepared knowledge lets her flip the confrontation and restore the truce. The “false starts” structure gives a clear middle escalation and primes the eventual snap of the truce and the crowd’s gasp. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she attains the recording she wanted but chooses to prioritize mending over observation, with the truce enduring to sunrise. The main limitation is that the path feels relatively smooth—no serious setback or near-failure to complicate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: Elara arrives with a question, uses the ring despite doubt, follows its sensory guidance, witnesses the forest election, and reaches a conceptual epiphany in the stone circle. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when anchored quickly), and the accumulative structure coheres under a hybrid causal/textural lens. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing: the compass is redefined as compassion, and “weather-carriers” are reinterpreted as empathic conduits, with her stance permanently altered. The main limitation is that the path to this realization unfolds smoothly, without any structural complication or reversal that truly threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: lock → cave canvas → sketch → glowing numbers → lock as key → hidden compartment → note → internal shift. Causality is strong within the magical-realism frame, and the closure—Elara’s recommitment to art—lands with a clear before/after. The puzzle elements (combination 3-1-4, lock as key) are convenient but seeded enough to feel organic. The scene holds one continuous drive without digressions or structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the map and plate → journey through the city accumulating tiny truths → chamber revelation → reoriented practice back home. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each candid encounter both advancing the search and reweighting her understanding of “where conversations go.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the supposed treasure site is empty of artifacts and full of realization, with a legible before/after. The main slight weakness is a touch of explanatory summarizing near the end that tells us the conclusion rather than letting the final images fully carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure functions as an accumulative ritual: tuning, activation, crescendo, and the ice fragment’s depletion create a clean arc with an Earned Stasis/RR closure. Causality is simple but coherent—her push and the solstice alignment lead to the symphony, which exhausts the fragment’s light. The cost is largely conceptual (using up a cycle of stored blue) rather than dramatized as a hard choice, but it is visible in the shard’s dulling and her acceptance. Orientation is strong from the opening and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: geomagnetic shift → static → articulated goal → devised ritual → execution → re-harmonized memory and renewed purpose, with no major gaps or teleports. Closure lands as a Decisive Change / Resonant Reconfiguration: Unit Seven realigns its “true north” and completes the controlled burn, with emotional cost and gain legible on the page. The story holds a coherent single scene with light reflection and returns to its opening situation charged by the new bud and reoriented mission. Stakes are relatively intimate and the process unfolds quite smoothly, but for this length the structure feels solid and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: accumulated testimonies → insight about the locket → key → mailbox → letters and the granddaughter’s note → city official’s decision. The ticking-clock demolition notice provides structural tightening, and the arrival of the official gives a clear closure beat with real consequences. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/RR: the mailbox shifts from “obstruction” to sanctioned shrine, and decades of limbo resolve. The main softness is how smoothly the official pivots, with minimal resistance or negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: journal clue → dice roll → “LISTEN” → recognition of the chime → timed valve turn → buoy launch, with each step motivated and legible. Closure is decisive and on-page: she triggers the emergency system, altering her rescue prospects and reconfiguring her relationship to fear and solitude. The cost is credible—she remains physically alone in a precarious environment, with only faith in the signal and her reconfigured self as compensation. The drive lens reads as a Causal/Accumulative hybrid, but it holds consistently through to a satisfying, earned end.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong: whale → renewed urgency → coffee-ground divination → chamber → geode → memory recovery, all under a single, coherent drive lens. Closure is on-page and legible: the memory is restored, gravity settles, and her role reconfigures, with emotional cost paid in the recovered pain and relief. The structure—a linear quest in one day with a single major transition—is clean and appropriate to length. The main weakness is that the procedural steps inside the chamber resolve a bit too smoothly once she reaches the geode, with peril hinted more than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: sanctuary → attunement/mapping → locating the fracture → deploying the hush → aftermath of restored balance. Orientation (who, where, when, why) is anchored early, and the accumulative ritual logic holds throughout. Closure is solid—a decisive change with cosmic and communal implications plus a resonant, quieter personal reconfiguration at the end. The cost is somewhat abstract (no palpable risk of failure), which keeps the arc from feeling fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: a single rooftop-tea scene interwoven with revelations about the building’s past, leading to a conceptual reframe at the end. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each disclosure naturally follows from the previous exchange and Elara’s questions. Closure is strong via a resonant reconfiguration: the gift of the seal and the “song to hum along with” reprice the premise with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that no beat truly tightens external options; the arc is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: a single ritual scene with a clear before/after, causally linked steps (waiting for the last star, humming the frequency, the resonance activating, memory transfer, burial). The global drive feels primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine—the ritual’s stages steadily deepen pressure and culminate in the archive. Closure is on-page and legible: once the crystal takes the memory and the shell cools, her options and inner stance are reconfigured with a visible cost (relinquishing the raw, immersive form of the memory). There are no orientation or causality slips; if anything, the sequence is a bit smooth, with no real threat that the process might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: a man with a specific past crime comes to a known sanctuary with two relics, performs a ritual, and undergoes a decisive internal shift. The single-scene structure is coherent and accumulative, with the keyhole reveal and the stopping of the drips marking clear turns toward closure. Closure—Kael laying down his burden and leaving without relics—is legible, with the cost (thirty years of guilt and sacrifice) clearly felt. The main structural limitation is that the ritual’s success feels inevitable; there’s little sense that it might fail or demand a harder on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: dissonant echoes → shell’s clues → identification of the three souls → revelation of Kael’s lie → song that releases the echoes. Closure is solidly on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s emotional acoustics transform, and the web of grief is reweighted with forgiveness and truth. The progressive disclosure structure is coherent and paid off, but the investigation is almost entirely spoon-fed by the shell, so problem-solving and constraint feel light. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/emotional, with minimal on-page cost beyond sorrow and effort.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: shrine → Lena’s arrival in memory → dream immersion → recovered memory → decision → letter and rainbow affirmation, all under a single focal lens. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural drive; each beat deepens the initial situation rather than introducing new complications. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the snow globe redefined as a vessel of love and Elara’s work “complete.” Cost is modest and mostly conceptual, but the before/after is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene that progresses logically from ascent, to mending, to tea, to fireflies, to whistle, to crystallized philosophy. Under a textural lens, each beat adds density to the core concern of hidden effort and pattern, and the whistle–helix response provides a clear tightening and pivot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes “strength” as “demure audacity,” carrying that understanding into his descent. Stakes and cost remain contemplative and small-scale, but the before/after in his conceptual stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: legend → investigation → discovery of container → reconstruction of letters → revelation of the stillpoint’s nature → ethical decision to preserve the lie. The piece lands an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure: she forecloses the path of exposure and commits to guardianship with visible conceptual cost. The embedded backstory via letters is well anchored in present action and doesn’t disrupt orientation. The only minor weakness is the somewhat convenient speed with which she locates the exact cache under moss, but it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s method → fragmented reception in different locales → divergent responses → the solstice act that opens the vault → feedback reaching her to complete the loop. The mosaic/multi-POV structure is legible and supports the “variant allegiance” concept without disorientation, and the rare 23-second ionospheric clearing provides a clear structural and plot hinge. Closure is solidly on the page: the world’s options change (seed vault revealed, Kael’s doctrine eroded) and Elara’s status reconfigures. The main limit is that complications are relatively smooth; events align neatly without much on-page resistance or cost beyond implied past solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: dawn ritual → discovery/use of the music box → capturing and dedicating the jar → redefinition of purpose. Causality is modest but coherent (finding the box leads to the Elara-focused act, which in turn crystallizes his role). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his exile as vocation and redemption as ongoing practice. The arc is quiet and linear, with no structural missteps, though it never tightens to a sharp turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: dissonant shriek → realization of stabilizer failure → choice to descend → iterative vibrational matching → restored harmony. The structure is a single, coherent descent-and-return arc with a clear before/after for both the Chime and the marina, satisfying closure via Decisive Change plus a resonant reconfiguration of the world’s tone. The stakes (marina’s defense and the Chime’s “agony”) are present on the page and resolved, but the path from problem to solution is fairly smooth, with no major reversal or complication. Still, the ending’s quiet, earned stasis is solidly anchored in the established drive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the prior rain recharges the viaduct, which refracts moonlight at the precise moment after the lake freezes, enabling the sigil and the unyoking ritual. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear build toward the alignment and the act of pressing her palm to the sigil. Closure lands as a tangible before/after (the first green life emerging, her inner shift) with visible conceptual cost in the years of disciplined waiting. Escalation is a bit one-note—events unfold smoothly without a significant complication or on-page risk, which limits the structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: investigation → discovery of lantern → entangled memories → gathering evidence → renewed resolve to dismantle the society. The piece delivers a clean Resonant Reconfiguration closure: she leaves the tunnel with a concretely changed stance and a charged object. Still, key pressures (the society’s doctrine, Thomas’s penance, her own prior entanglement) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page turning points. Escalation is mostly conceptual, so the structure feels solid but not grippingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Samuel’s execution → Elias’s guilt → failed first repair → search for a second opinion → discovery that the heart “was never broken” → internal reorientation. The single-scene structure in the shop (with brief, anchored penitentiary backstory) is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elias reframes his apology into an ongoing obligation, with the cost of never being able to help Samuel himself. Nothing crucial happens off-stage in a way that undercuts the emotional or logical arc.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: daily ritual → long evolution → one twilight vision → execution and repercussion. Causality within this lyric frame is solid—the kaleidoscope’s circle leads directly to transliteration, which triggers the resonator’s activation and the universe’s "answer." Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, the bell is hypothetical; after, it has rung and begun changing the universe’s texture, with her cost paid in invisible, long-term labor. Stakes remain conceptually high but are never muddled, and the ending feels conclusive at the chosen scale.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s long-term obsession → pattern recognition in Lena’s data → forbidden terminal access → discovery of Psi → Lena’s revelation → Elara’s ethical choice. Orientation is strong from the outset; we know who Elara is, where she is, and what she’s doing. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she forecloses exposure in favor of guardianship, with a clear ethical and professional cost. Some elements (the deprecated terminal’s instant success, the tidy appearance of a fully curated secret archive) tilt toward convenience, but they don’t break the drive lens or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: fragment → mirrors/glimpses → reconstitution → planting crystal → transformed orchard/ice. Structure is linear with one clear transition (orchard → gift shop → orchard) and a decisive on-page change at the end, so closure is solid. The “weighted breath before reply” functions as a nice hinge but the sense of cost or risk in that pause is more asserted atmospherically than borne out in options narrowing. The result feels satisfying and legible but somewhat low-friction, with little sense that failure is a live possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative/lyric and coherent: from waking, to volunteering and trawling, to the journal discovery, to communal fire, to night reflection, each beat builds toward a reweighted understanding of endings. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why she’s here), and there is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands in her redefinition of the “sound of approaching endings” and her stance toward her own scheduled death (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). The one softness is that the cost and tension around “appointment tomorrow” remain mostly conceptual rather than plot-driven, muting structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: missed bus → enforced pause at the vacant station → Elara’s intervention → concrete perspective shifts → tentative reconciliation and revaluation of solitude. The story maintains one coherent scene with an embedded mini-history for Elara, Clara, and Liam, and it closes on a clear Resonant Reconfiguration rather than just a mood. Cost is legible in the paths foreclosed: the missed escape, the acceptance of their flaws, Elara’s acceptance of solitude as vocation. A slight issue is how smoothly the turn comes once Elara speaks; there is minimal on-page struggle before things start to repair.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: ritual steps build from sensing the parapet to conjuring and charging the clearing, then releasing it. Causality is coherent and motivation-driven—urgency from the prophet’s fading resonance feeds directly into each tactical choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: preservation is reframed as letting wisdom reside and waiting for “the next listener who arrives with peripheral awareness.” The cost is quiet but legible in his physical fatigue and the relinquishing of control over what he’s safeguarded.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, mosaic structure is coherent: repeated Tuesday gatherings, then widening community engagement, then the gallery and harvest-moon gathering form a clear progression. Causality is soft but present—Elara’s method leads to individual shifts, which aggregate into communal transformation and a re-seeing of the factory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the factory’s meaning and Elara’s role are conceptually repriced, with her empty map case and chosen lingering marking an endpoint. The main limitation is a lack of any structural or causal complication; events unfold smoothly with little jeopardy to the trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: quiet setup → listening ritual → deeper-than-usual sonic sequence → realization → physical act of restoration and departure, forming a coherent before/after. Causality is intact under a textural lens—the unusually charged “suspended hush” leads to a new pattern of sounds, which motivates his understanding and action. Closure is on the page and legible: he has decoded the pattern and alters his life by leaving, with the crystal returned to testify in his stead. The cost—relinquishing his sanctuary and life’s routine—is present but understated, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: markers → fog responses → rocking chair → loss → renewed vow, all cohering under a textural/accumulative lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—she cannot cure her forgetting, but recommits to the ritual with a deeper, cost-aware purpose after relosing her grandfather. Causality is internally consistent and oriented from the opening; the only small limit is that the decisive turn (from ache to purpose) feels more softly lyrical than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: quake → malfunction → threatened observation → contemplative pause → leaf-triggered realization → careful repair → successful capture → reconfigured understanding. Causality is tight and legible, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “escape velocity” and her craft as yielding rather than conquering. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than material but is present as a relinquishing of control in favor of humility. The piece maintains a single coherent scene without temporal muddle, and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from diagnostic verdict to musical intervention to emotional reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—Elara’s song, the shard, and the lavender scent each deepen the emotional state rather than create abrupt “plot” turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief shifts from mute paralysis to shared remembrance and charged keepsake. Cost is legible in Arthur and Lena’s acceptance of impending loss, making the before/after boundary clear.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → study → orrery + key → corrupted rune → correction → sealed awakening, with no orientation issues. Closure is decisive and legible: reality is partially mended and the central question of where shadows go is answered on the page. The cost is more conceptual than felt—there’s relief and awe, but little sense of risk or what might have been lost. Structure is elegant and coherent, though somewhat low in perceived jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine—discovery of the substitute body → examination of the tooth → realization Lyra wasn’t replaced → decision to re-educate the village—is clear and coherent. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the changeling panic as a communal fracture she can “set,” with visible future cost in the emotional labor implied. Structure is essentially a single reflective scene with good anchoring and one decisive turn at the tooth’s inspection. The main limitation is that external resistance is entirely hypothetical, so structural pressure never tightens beyond her own realization.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: entering the grotto, the polishing process, memory interleaving, then the emergence with the finished object and intention to give it to Liam. Causality is coherent and orientation is strong from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elara reconceives her earthbound state as refinement and commits to offering the "pearl of stillness" to Liam with emotional cost. The main limitation is that the drive feels more like a steady meditation than a pressured progression, which slightly mutes the impact of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → discovery of the icicle pattern → guided movement → offering → exit, with a clear before/after in her stance toward regret. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens—each environmental cue motivates the next internal and external move. Closure lands on-page with cost: the deliberate surrender of the pendant and the choice to leave it embedded, framed as a chapter shift rather than total absolution. Stakes remain modest and interior, but the ritual’s logic and emotional cost are fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: cameos of hope build toward a reconfiguration where he chooses authenticity over demanded nihilism. The drive lens is consistent and the closure is legible: leaving the seashell and accepting a quiet peace is a clear before/after. Cost is implied (risking his career, rejecting convention) but not concretely dramatized on the page, which softens the impact. Still, the pattern from first paragraph to last is clean and structurally sound for lyric fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is very clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear because/therefore chain from dawn hush → song → tendril activation → grove restoration. The alignment of harvest moon and sunrise gives a natural hinge for the climax, and closure is decisive with a clear before/after for the grove. Cost is present conceptually (decades of preparation, the uniqueness of the moment) but lightly felt in the climax, where success comes without serious on-page jeopardy. Still, the drive lens (largely causal with accumulative texture) is coherent and closure lands firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: careful ritual preparation → alignment and offering → starlight’s response → transformation of the paper and orchard. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid very early, and the accumulative drive is consistent through to the bud’s emergence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the map is made, the environment subtly but decisively shifts, and the “seed planted in time” recasts prior labor with cost (blood, time, bodily strain). The only limitation is that the risk of failure, though implied, never fully tightens the options or forces a hard trade-off beyond success vs null result.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline—enter cavern → diagnose mechanism via reflections over the day → repair → harvest echoes → depart transformed—is clean and easy to follow. Structure is essentially one continuous scene stretched across a day, with a clear closure beat when the harvest succeeds and his purpose crystallizes. However, tension is minimal and costs are conceptual rather than dramatized, so the decisive change lands gently. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, but the lack of concrete pressure keeps the plot from feeling fully vital.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single ritual from setup through complication (resisting anxiety) to successful calcification and quiet denouement. Causality within the magic logic holds: master’s teaching → reorientation of thread → anxiety crystallizes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: one burden removed, Elara re-commits to her role with a clearer sense of solitude and purpose. Stakes remain small and internal, but for an accumulative/lyric lens they resolve satisfyingly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one ritual window, bounded by the kettle’s hum and whistle, during which memory and carving build toward a reconfigured relationship with grief. Causality is modest but coherent—each sensory cue (rain, tools, lions) justifies the next reflection and action, and the kettle whistle provides an on-page closure beat. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a decisive external turn, but it lands: her stance toward loss is palpably different by the last paragraph. Escalation is subtle enough that in a highly competitive market, some readers may want one sharper moment of destabilization or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story uses an accumulative/textural structure effectively: collecting auditory fragments builds toward the confrontation and integration with the younger self. Causality is clear enough—she halts to collect, then approaches, then offers the wheel, leading to the merger—and there is a legible before/after in her relationship to ambition and regret. Closure (a resonant reconfiguration) lands on the page with cost in the realization that she misread her compromises, and the future voice “I am enough” crisply marks the new stance. A minor weakness is that obstacles never meaningfully threaten her drive, so structural tension is more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the sextant fragment → realization about “flow” as the terminal’s skeleton → concrete work to redirect water → refraction and the star chart closure image. The story functions well under a Hybrid/accumulative lens; the accumulating motifs of flow, maze, and resurrection all converge in the final visual and conceptual reweighting. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in the building’s status and Elara’s understanding—but the cost is almost entirely conceptual, with little real sacrifice or consequence. Structure is stable and legible, but the stakes never tighten beyond a quiet, solved puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → approach → ritual act with the fork → resonance → reconfiguration, all in one continuous scene. Causality under a textural lens holds: her decision to activate the fork triggers the note, which enables the reframing of her life’s work. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost—she leaves the fork and walks away lighter but changed. The plot is simple, but within this scope it’s sufficient and tightly contained.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: she recovers the sundial, examines it, uncovers the coordinates, reinterprets the past expedition, and then makes a new commitment. Backstory about Thorne and the fake expedition slots logically into the present, with the realization about his estate as a strong structural turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses vengeance and redefines her future work. The main weakness is that the expedition’s key pressures are summarized rather than partially dramatized, slightly reducing the felt cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with causal steps—waiting, arrival, decoding, retrieval, realization—leading to a resonant, contemplative closure. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and it holds throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: method over object, with Elara’s role in the long weave reweighted at the end. The cost is quiet but legible as responsibility and ongoing labor rather than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ship’s departure → entry into garden → ritual with the thread → vision of Isolde → Kael’s confirmation → resolution in the journal. Causality within the magical premise holds, and the closure—reframing Isolde’s absence and Elara’s role—lands on the page with a clear before/after. The cost is subtle but legible: Elara takes on the burden of carrying and communicating a difficult wisdom. Escalation is more textural than event-driven, which suits the piece but keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: decades of preparation lead to this one alignment, the ritual, the unexpected spectral birth, and then the reconfiguration of his goal. Closure is strong as an on-page resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—he discovers the world cannot host the Lark in physical form and reframes his purpose around remembrance. The stakes and sequence remain legible throughout with no orientation debt, and the final descent image clearly marks the “after” state. The only ceiling here comes from the relatively low external resistance; the main tension is internal and could tighten one more notch.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric structure: walking to the lagoon, performing the ritual, remembering, and then exiting with a reconfigured stance, all in one continuous scene. Causality is modest but coherent—each object she deploys (sand, coin, kelp, thread) advances the emotional arc toward a resonant reconfiguration where her father’s legacy is repriced. Closure is clear and on the page: she leaves changed, carrying the “song of scars” rather than shame. The main constraint is that the progression feels smooth rather than pressured, so turns are gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline—follow breadcrumb → partially unlock box → proceed to next fountain—reads cleanly and culminates in a decisive change when the box opens and the city’s fountains revive. Orientation (who/where/when) is very clear from the first few lines, and the drive lens remains consistently causal with accumulative lyric texture. Closure has both external consequence (water returns) and internal reconfiguration (skepticism tempered into knowing), with a tangible cost in the urgency of the dawn deadline and the long-held sorrow the city carries. The only limitation is that the journey unfolds without real structural surprise or complication, so the arc feels satisfying but somewhat straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: patterned pings, adjustments of the gear, and generational echoes build toward a resonant acceptance of endless, fireless tending. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: she reaffirms participation in the infinite cycle with a felt weight and peace. Yet the central hazard (igniting the nebula) never faces an on-page near miss or concrete complication, so the plot’s tension remains largely hypothetical. Structure is clean and continuous, but the absence of a sharper turn or real test keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: present-moment contemplation → guided retracing of memory → conceptual breakthrough about the memorial’s design. The closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the realization that grief is migratory connection and the decision to embody this in the circular path of poems and resin ribbons. Causality is soft but intact: Lyra’s prompt leads to revisiting family ritual, which in turn sparks the design solution. The cost is implied (taking on the town’s trauma and the weight of representing it) rather than dramatized in conflict, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a causal approach from ridge to tower to pendulum, with a central reverie triggered at the pendulum’s zenith and a return to a subtly reweighted world. The dominant lens reads as accumulative/textural—each image (ridge, rake handle, inscriptions, pendulum) stacks toward a closure where timekeeping and absolution are reinterpreted. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward her work and legacy shifts, and the village responds (Liam’s nod) with a felt payoff. The cost is conceptual—the ongoing, daily burden of “incremental” atonement—which lands clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: enter the silo, use the case tools on the tapestry, each thread reveals a specific aspect of Albright’s intention, culminating in a clear realization and a future-facing image (the spiral of forget-me-nots). Causality is straightforward and well-handled under an accumulative/textural lens, with each decoded thread deepening knowledge rather than producing arbitrary effects. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Albright’s “resignation” and the town’s confusion, with a before/after in Elara’s understanding that feels earned. The main limitation is that the plot never meaningfully threatens failure or misinterpretation, so structural tension is more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain from data-gathering to predictive model to planned ice-fracture is coherent and cleanly laid out, and the story closes on a clear Charged Poise: the moment before she commits her plan to the page. The dominant drive lens is causal, and the closure unit is her decisive internal shift from uncertainty to informed commitment, which lands clearly. Still, all conflict and “action” remain in reflective mode; we never see her model challenged by another force or circumstance in scene, so the felt cost of that decision is more conceptual than visceral. Structurally, it’s tight and legible, but the climax is deliberately underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: a single, continuous night of illicit listening that builds to a quiet reconfiguration of her role and task. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and solid, and the pirate broadcast’s arrival, partial loss, and fade provide a gentle arc. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she ends with a charged poise, journal in hand, committing to “invite” stories back rather than merely preserve them. Cost is present but subtle—ongoing risk and solitude more implied than confronted in a decisive crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure around a single ritual scene is clean and coherent, with the rocking chair and ash-scattering giving it a clear arc. Causality is simple but intact: gather fragment → make powder → make portrait → scatter ash → chair stops → conceptual shift. Closure is solidly a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing around safety and vulnerability, and it’s clearly on the page. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: routine → disruptive find → dilemma → chosen stance, all within one coherent scene. Causality is clear—discovering the tablet forces a decision that reconfigures his approach from potential whistleblower to committed secret-keeper. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with cost: he forecloses open confrontation in favor of clandestine preservation. The only limitation is that external consequences remain hypothetical, keeping the arc slightly hermetic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure: repeated rehearsals, silence practices, and seasonal markers steadily deepen the central situation. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the rosette’s meaning flips from loss to continuity and Liam and Anya’s exchange concretizes the unlearning of hatred. Causality is soft but coherent—Elara’s method of held silence and non-coercive guidance clearly leads to the relational thaw. Cost is legible in the time, vulnerability, and sustained effort required, as well as the risk that the choir might have failed and disbanded.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → pruning/releasing memories → celestial peak → planting → immediate sprouting → resolved stance. Causal links are clear (clearing space allows planting; alignment empowers the seed; channeling memories feeds growth), and the closure image reconfigures the greenhouse from tomb to cradle. The drive feels mostly accumulative/textural, and under that lens the progression is coherent and satisfying. Cost is present but soft—no truly pressured choice or irreversible sacrifice beyond emotional labor and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → misdiagnosed software error → Aris’s visit → riddle → reframing of the failure, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the blackout shifts from technical glitch to “blinded by beauty,” and Aris adopts a new design philosophy. However, the problem is solved in a single, low-friction conversation; the city-scale stakes never tighten on the page, and there’s little sense of cost or risk in revealing the truth. The structure is solid but feels more like an elegant explanation than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: approach → ritual → hush → re-seeing the house → conceptual reconfiguration of her life’s quest. Causality is clean within the mode—the planted shard leads to the hush, which enables the perceptual and conceptual shift. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: she reframes what makes a home alive and her own work’s purpose, with a clear before/after in stance. Stakes and cost remain modest and largely interior, keeping this shy of the highest band despite the structural control.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael in the garden with the ampoule → application to the spire’s fracture → cascading revelations → psychic dissemination → garden’s renewal and his internal shift. Structure is linear and legible, with the “first/second/third/fourth revelation” pattern teaching an accumulative drive lens effectively. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s past, its designed weakness, and the garden’s purpose are reweighted, and the final image makes a before/after clear. The main limitation is the relatively low sense of jeopardy or cost in the climax; events feel inevitable rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: cycles of proof → development of “The Rupture Theorem” → on-page rupture → refusal to exit → reconfigured relationship to the staircase. Causality holds cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (Earned Stasis / Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the concrete cost of chosen confinement. Orientation is solid from the first lines (who/where/what) and never wavers. The midsection reiterates her processes a bit without adding a second significant tightening, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: greenhouse setup → moonlit daydream → creation of the painting → public test at the bus stop → confirmation and renewed vow. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: her ritual produces a memory, which produces art, which produces a response that reframes her insomnia. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when insomnia becomes a “vigil” and the “lost languages” are recast as dormant seeds. Stakes are modest but coherent, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure and causality are strong: Elara’s observation → reinterpretation of the carvings and oral history → confrontation with Hemlock → communal action → reclaimed ritual, all under a clear causal throughline. The closure combines a decisive change (the custom resumes in adapted form) with a resonant reconfiguration (the beekeeper is decentered; adaptation becomes the core rule), and cost is legible in the years of loss and the ritual’s bittersweetness. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural overlay, and that lens holds cleanly to the end. The only constraint on an even higher score is that obstacles resolve rather swiftly once the silver-leaf idea emerges, with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the yoyo → engineering the reversal mechanism → timing with the hunger stone’s exposure → activating the counter-rotating light that reframes the stone’s message. The piece leans Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural flavor, and the closure—conceptual repricing of the lighthouse’s purpose and the stone’s warning—lands clearly on the page. That said, the path from decision to success is very smooth; no turn truly threatens the outcome or forces a new tactic. Structure and closure are solid and publishable, but the lack of structural surprises or complications keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: resuscitation → funhouse entry → mirror corridor → dictionary-guided tactic → confrontation → fear’s confession → curse’s partial lifting. The dominant stake (uncover fear’s weakness) is clear early and resolved directly in the climax when the entity admits “My weakness… is being seen.” Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the fear-thing is dissolved, the funhouse is recontextualized as “just wood and glass,” and the advisor’s void heals. The cost is somewhat gentle—he trades eldritch power/aura for ordinary humanity—but it’s on the page and conceptually coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric, accumulative frame: clouds → interpretation → ritual → mounting storm → final dub → transformed tempest. Orientation is excellent from the first lines and the ritual sequence tracks clearly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the storm converted into song and the orchard preserved. The main limitation is the relative absence of cost or risk at the climax, which keeps the decisive turn from feeling truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: years of study → identification of the crack → calculated note → gate transformation → walk toward the Watchers, with no major logic gaps. The piece lands a solid closure: she decisively leaves the sealed city, reconfiguring her role from survivor to “the question itself,” with the cost of venturing into an ominous unknown. Structure is tight—a single accumulating scene with integrated backstory that clearly tilts the present. The only thing keeping this from a 9-band is that the success of her attempt feels almost pre-ordained; there’s little sense the ritual could fail or backfire in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: petal falls → letter is read → parallels are drawn → stance is crystallized at departure, with a legible before/after in how Aris and the station are seen. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, as he reframes the station from "haunted by a lie" to "witness to courageous remembering." Cost is present but mostly conceptual and deferred (the town's upheaval is off-page), so the ending lands more as quiet conviction than a hard-earned turn. Still, causality and pattern are coherent and appropriate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: drawbridge rises → repair/inscription ritual → drawbridge signals the lake’s return and departure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: absence is conceptually repriced into a “tapestry” or “hidden library,” with a visible time cost (the narrowing window) and emotional cost (unshed tears, incomplete work). Causality is straightforward and coherent; each step follows from the prior in a ritual logic. The piece is structurally modest but fully legible under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → investigation opportunity → alternative hypothesis → physical examination (watermark, sigil) → confirmation of palimpsest → choice in how to mark it → closure. The piece operates primarily on an accumulative/textural lens, but within that, the structural arc is legible and satisfying, with the palimpsest reveal and stamp decision forming a coherent closure unit (conceptual repricing of the Charter and the library’s role). Cost is mostly conceptual and social (exposing colonial erasure) rather than dramatized as immediate danger or repercussion, which keeps this just shy of top-tier. Orientation (who/where/when) is excellent from the opening sentence, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: polish gem → travel to basilica → dream recording → return and fold crane, closing with a renewed but altered routine. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each step follows logically from the prior one, and the dream-recording sequence meaningfully tightens focus on the core loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her situation is unchanged but her stance and the meaning of her grief have shifted with visible cost. The stakes are quiet and wholly internal, which fits the mode but keeps the arc from feeling truly pivotal beyond her psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the temporary power-down, with a causal chain from experiment to vision to reorientation. Orientation is strong—who, where, when, and why are anchored early, and the circuit-breaker clock gives the scene a subtle spine. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: she has gained concrete knowledge at emotional cost and chooses to live differently, with a clear before/after. The only ceiling is that escalation stays modest and inward, without a major turn or complication beyond deepening the same movement.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drone survey → identification of the fracture → pulling the stone → inserting the chip → orrery activation → emotional reconfiguration. Structure is linear, well oriented, and fits the single-scene window, with no major causality gaps or teleporting elements. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s loneliness is replaced by connection to both the orrery and Elara, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is how frictionless the recovery feels; the mission never genuinely risks failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: terrace → descent to shore to quell regret → ritual sifting → discovery of watch-hand carving → recollection of the letter → ethical reframing → vow to confess. This fits a largely causal drive with an accumulative lyric texture, and closure is a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration as he commits to act at dawn. Backstory is cued concretely by the carving and remains legible; there is no orientation debt. The only limit is that external stakes remain summarized (Elara is off-page), so structural pressure never tightens beyond his interior resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in place and time, moving causally from tense waiting through the synchronized signal to the release and aftermath. The global drive feels Hybrid leaning Accumulative—external events are straightforward, while meaning builds via repetition of symbols (moon, parapet, drawer pull) toward a resonant final reconfiguration. Closure is solidly on-page: the exchange completes and Elias’s relationship to his failure-token decisively shifts. What keeps it out of the highest band is the lack of any serious complication or turn in the exchange itself; the scene unfolds almost exactly as announced.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: poles-as-penance → coast run begun → poles ending at Widow’s Point → crisis → turn to sky and compass → reconfigured journey. Closure is clear and on-page, with a decisive change in tactics and outlook that creates a before/after line. The global drive is causal with a strong situational accent at Widow’s Point and holds consistently. The only modest shortfall is that the transition from breakdown to renewed trust is quite compressed, with minimal lingering friction after the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: procedure → emptiness → search for empathy → newspaper-guided descent → bioluminescent lake → transformative act. The labyrinth’s clues escalate coherently and lead to a clear closure unit where his stance toward his past and his capacity for empathy have decisively changed, with cost visible in the grief he finally allows in. Structure is linear and legible; the only limiting factor is how little the puzzles ever truly threaten failure, keeping the plot from feeling fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual preparation → scent-mist → gathered beasts → metaphysical expansion → transformation into saplings/orchard. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after and cost (she relinquishes her human life/role to become the threshold itself). The fortune’s instruction is paid off by the literalized threshold she becomes, and nothing crucial is left unresolved for this scope. The beat sequence is slightly linear and risk-averse, but fully coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: climb → altar preparation → visionary sequence → conceptual repricing about “where lost time accumulates.” Causality under a textural lens holds cleanly, and closure is on-page with visible cost (she forecloses the path of obsessive control in favor of acceptance). The single-scene window is well-contained with no orientation problems. The main structural weakness is that the realization is delivered in a somewhat expository register, softening the dramatic feel of the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a ritual in a single contained space escalates from preparation through emotional integration to opening the dimension and stepping through. Causality is solid under an accumulative lens—each memory and stitch contributes to her growing lightness and the crystal’s charge, culminating in the lock unraveling. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she crosses the threshold, no longer the last isolated human but a bridge. Stakes remain somewhat abstractly sketched (the nature and risk of the dimension are hinted more than dramatized), which trims the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with one late shard (Mano/prophecy) that reweights the prior action and delivers closure. Causality is mostly accumulative—detour → beach → release → volcano’s hum shifting—fitting an almost-mythic frame, with a clear before/after once the bugs are freed. The coincidence of her private act satisfying a large-scale prophecy is thematically apt but slightly convenient, and the volcano’s threat never exerts concrete pressure on her choices. Closure (her felt internal shift plus the mountain’s peace) is solid and legible, but not yet at a structurally dazzling level.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean and causal: blackout → courtyard/sundial → hidden cache → signal → return to post, all in one coherent scene. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative with clear causal steps, and the closure—a reconfigured sense of the blackout as “canvas” and the revolution’s first “silent page”—lands on the page. Orientation is excellent and never confusing. The main limitation is that the decisive change (network awakened) carries more conceptual than felt cost, so the ending is satisfying but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: a frictionless world → Kael’s injunction → Elara’s ritual with star dust and patterns → partial restoration with an on-page cost. The piece reads as largely accumulative/textural with one decisive causal turn when the circle’s friction returns, followed by a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as she reframes her role. Stakes and world rules are legible, and the closure image (earned vs. borrowed dawn, children who might one day “run without sliding”) lands with conceptual cost. Escalation is modestly handled—her brief vision of failure doesn’t seriously disrupt the inevitability of success—but the structural arc is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: solitary vigil → discovery of timetable/envelope → reading/epiphany → recommitment to writing, all in a single continuous scene. Causality is straightforward and legible even in a lyric mode; the letter’s arrival via the timetable is a bit convenient but not implausible. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: the vigil redefined from passive endurance to purposeful witnessing, with a before/after visible on the page. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, but the crack in her composure and the renewed risk of speaking in a censored world keep it from feeling costless.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: she arrives summoned, decodes the sundial via the needles, uncovers the overture, and leaves with a new stance. As an accumulative/lyric design, it builds through pattern and imagery rather than sharp causal turns, and that pattern holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the sundial’s shadow unifies and she reorients from solitary analysis to collaborative intent, but the cost of this shift is implied rather than dramatized. Stakes remain abstract (philosophical “confluence”) so the before/after line is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: present-moment library scene framed by one coherent backstory shard about prison, all causally feeding the current project. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural—pressure builds through mood and motif toward the molt and the planting rather than via big reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara conceptually reprices her molting from threat to engine of resistance, embodied by planting the sunflower seed. Cost is legible—she lets Silas dissolve and accepts the vulnerability of a new, less “load-bearing” self while the collective project depends on her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: research → ritual via film → passage to the arbor → guided compasses → duet with Leo → altered clock and renewed stance. The story observes its own rules (timeframe, cipher, arbor logic) without late-breaking cheats, and the closure unit—the clock’s minute gained plus her recommitment to playing—is legible and satisfying. Cost is present but quiet: she cannot remain with Leo, gains only a minute, and returns to the same terminal with a reweighted relationship to grief. Structure is essentially a clean two-shard arc (terminal → arbor → terminal) with no orientation or lens debt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal line—monsoon threat → last seed → ritual attempt via dreams → apparent failure → activation → new role—is clean, legible, and satisfying. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: reality-checking is conceptually repriced to include dreams and doubt, with on-page cost in the form of expanded, weightier responsibility. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with embedded memory, and the transitions are smooth. A touch of summary in the final third (“She would document this not in dry ledgers…”) slightly flattens immediacy but doesn’t damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: islet → ritual with lace and compass → immersive memory → return to islet with altered stance, all under one coherent drive. Causality is consistent (following the lace activates the compass, which initiates the memory experience), and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration where he re-enters his life with a new relationship to regret. Cost is legible in his emotional exposure and the fact that the severance remains, even as its sharpness is reweighted. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure effectively uses the multi-day visits to build a quiet epiphany, and the closure (repairing the roof, leaving the leaf) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the pacing is linear and lacks a decisive turning point where the protagonist's initial goal fights back before surrendering. The orientation is clear, and the mosaic approach fits the timeframe well.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is static, consisting almost entirely of reflection triggered by looking at frost. While there is a conceptual shift (evidence to art), the causal link between the frost patterns and the ledger codes feels convenient and unearned. The closure relies on a future intention rather than an immediate, costly action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on a linear "problem-magical fix" structure with no meaningful setbacks. A significant logical contradiction undermines the premise: the text states "noise impossible" and sound is a "trigger," yet Elara "hummed" a melody without established difficulty or cost, creating a soft reset of the rules for convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, where the "impossible spaces" concept effectively bridges the physical lens and the metaphysical books. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the library's silence, though the "soft magic" resolution lacks mechanical grit or a distinct price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the ritual, and the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the bell’s purpose. However, the narrative arc lacks a decisive turning point where options are genuinely narrowed; the progression feels more like a vignette than a dramatized causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure where magic resolves the central issue without complication, twist, or meaningful obstacle. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction," tidily answering the premise without demanding a causal price or structural reconfiguration from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem-solution" path where a magical ritual functions exactly as intended without complication or failure, reducing the plot to the execution of a prior plan. The "retrocognitively trapped" condition creates a premise but does not actively hinder the protagonist's actions in the scene, resulting in low narrative friction. Closure is achieved through a "Conceptual Repricing" (time is forgiveness), but the lack of on-page obstacles makes the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality collapses at the climax when the demolition crew, previously established as an indifferent destructive force, instantly bows in spiritual awe upon seeing seeds. The logic of Elara’s twelve-year captivity—how she survived without resources or why she was chained in a carnival—remains a fable-like gap that undermines the narrative's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a significant obstacle or reversal; Elara descends, performs the task without resistance, and ascends changed. The causality relies on the magical realism of the "ashen forge" to solve the internal problem instantly, resulting in a low-tension arc where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a convenient magical decoder (moonbeams reveal the truth) that dissolves the central obstacle without cost or ingenuity. While the closure (walking into the forest) is a decisive change, it lacks a felt price; the conflict between "abandon" and "follow" is resolved instantly by the prop, removing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, but the inciting pressure and resolution rely on low-cost conveniences; the "disaster" is minor, and the solution comes from a handy maxim on a bookmark rather than earned struggle. The closure (placing the bookmark under glass) is symbolic but lacks a felt price or irreversible change in the character's circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution hinges on a contrived, unestablished mechanic (etching a shell to alter a signal) that solves the conflict too conveniently. While the narrative arc is complete, the causality feels forced to fit the prompt elements rather than arising from the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear descriptive vignette that lacks a causal arc or structural turning point. While the sequence is clear, the closure—finishing the map at dawn—feels like a procedural stopping point rather than a resolution earned through pressure or change. The "Orientation Test" passes, but the lack of a decisive shift or felt cost limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible with clear orientation and closure, but the causality hinge is weak; the protagonist acts because archives randomly “surfaced” after loop 31, not due to immediate scene pressure. The reveal of the loop as a “pedagogical sanctuary” lowers the stakes retrospectively, converting a potential trap into a safe classroom.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative proceeds linearly but lacks causal friction; the climax is a "soft reset" where a single gesture dissolves deep isolation without cost or risk. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction rather than an earned conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.3)
    The climax relies on a *deus ex machina* intervention by the maze itself, which resolves the threat for the protagonist rather than forcing her to act under pressure. This external rescue undermines the causal chain and diminishes Elara's agency at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is functional but frictionless; the device works perfectly on the first attempt, and the skeptic is converted instantly. Closure is legible as a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but it lacks a "felt cost" or significant complication to earn the resolution, resulting in a convenient, "just-so" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (peace/connection), but the ending is symmetrically satisfied with no felt cost or trade-off. The magical logic of the watermark response resolves the plot too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the fever-state to the realization, but the pivot relies on a contrivance: the smudge revealing a hidden bud only to "fever-sharpened sight." This lack of causal rigor weakens the closure. The backstory of Kael’s death is delivered in a reflection block that halts momentum rather than intensifying the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is strong, with the inciting call leading directly to the discovery and recontextualization of the object. The closure (turning the wheel) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the scene functions more as verification of a known backstory than a discovery of new information, slightly lowering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure is a low-stakes loop (departure, observation, return) that lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the status quo is merely affirmed. The closure relies on a journal entry to summarize the meaning ("The river speaks of patience"), telling the reader the point rather than dramatizing a shift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story follows a linear path to a "soft reset" resolution where the central conflict evaporates without visible cost or complication. Causality relies on asserted magic rather than earned emotional shifts, resulting in a convenient ending that lacks dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is a linear accumulation of details leading to a reaffirmation of the protagonist's role, lacking a decisive turn or felt cost. While the sequence is coherent, the ending feels like a summary of intent rather than a consequence of a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure—subverting the spycraft microdot in favor of the plain text—is a strong conceptual repricing that lands well. However, the plot relies on a significant contrivance: the successful delivery of a specific cookie to a specific table via a "debt owed" is told rather than shown, bypassing the logistical difficulty of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic words" resolution where stating the theme dissolves the central conflict without material or emotional cost. The causality is soft; the antagonist (possession) capitulates immediately to rhetorical inquiry, lacking the friction required for a satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is a linear ritual sequence that lacks causal complications; the "exhaustion" constraint functions as a mild pacer rather than a plot-altering pressure. Closure acts as a conceptual repricing of her job, but it arrives without visible cost or trade-off. The ending feels like a "gain-only" realization rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (dropping the tablet to heal) lands with clear intent. However, the causality is largely magical/psychological without a felt cost; the resolution "accepts" the past without dramatizing the difficulty or price of that acceptance beyond the initial hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible "Decisive Change" closure, but the structure is linear and lacks causal complexity. The "magical helper" archetype resolves the central problem with a single uninterrupted process, bypassing the need for the protagonist to navigate obstacles or pay a tangible cost for the change.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient and clear, with a distinct inciting incident (the clay) and a valid closure (sending the cipher). The logic holds well, though the resolution comes quickly via internal monologue rather than extended struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is sound, effectively using the greenhouse ritual to parallel the internal revelation. Closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing of her work, though the "message on the vial" acts as a convenient prop that resolves the central mystery externally rather than through earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story establishes a strict causal constraint (use the rope to descend or fail the quest) then invalidates it with a magical resolution where the protagonist keeps the rope and gains the knowledge anyway. This "have your cake and eat it too" ending lacks causal logic and cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction that undermines the narrative promise.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure unit (leaving the bowl) lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The pacing is steady, though the transition from realistic acoustic physics to the magical response of the sapling is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clean inciting incident and a decisive closure that alters the protagonist's professional and personal reality. The causal chain is tight, though the resolution moves swiftly, utilizing the "subsume" action to neatly tie up the conflict with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies heavily on a high-magnitude coincidence: Liam enters the garden exactly as Elias examines the locket, resolving the central search immediately without protagonist effort. The closure (writing a supportive note) is a "soft reset" that offers a heartwarming gesture but lacks the "visible or felt cost" required for a high-band Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal tension; the resolution relies on the convenience of finding the elusive tag immediately after Kael's fifty years of failure. The closure (placing the reeds) is symbolic but lacks a felt cost or obstacle, making the arc feel like a "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear path under a Causal lens, effectively using the "Silent Pause" as both opportunity and constraint. Closure lands as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of her artistic purpose, though the resolution is achieved through high competence rather than a complex choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a linear path to closure, but the ending is a "soft reset" where a magical vision removes the pain of loss without demanding a price. The resolution ("Kael is in the walls") offers symmetric satisfaction that evaporates the central tension rather than earning it through sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure, but the resolution relies on a convenient lack of external or interpersonal conflict. The inciting incident (power outage) adds atmosphere but doesn't causally force the timeline, and the climax is smoothed over by immediate mutual understanding, creating a "soft reset" of the intruder tension.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "Days later" transition (line 143) summarizes the implementation of the new method rather than dramatizing the difficulty of letting go, weakening the causal chain. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing (redefining the storm as a partner), but the summary bridge reduces the earned weight of this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is solid and the closure (curing the insomnia) is a valid Decisive Change. However, the plot hinges on a low-probability coincidence—finding the "lost" historian sitting on a rock exactly when Elias decides to take a walk—which undercuts the causal weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative momentum stalls mid-story for a dense block of explanatory backstory regarding the magic system ("The core concept hinged on...", "The prescribed method was..."). While the closure is legible, the conflict is resolved by following instructions and a simple internal pivot, making the structural tension feel low.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shift from a specific scene to a summary montage ("Day by deliberate day") dissipates the dramatic tension established by the trumpet's discovery. The narrative relies on a linear sequence of successes rather than a causal chain of escalating complications. Closure is achieved through affirmation rather than a decisive, high-cost action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, following a clear fable-like progression to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (surrendering the map). While the closure works conceptually and the "lens" holds, the resolution relies on magical convenience ("alchemical work") that smooths over the cost, making the outcome feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the protagonist finds an object, uses it successfully on the first try, and resolves the emotional stake without complication. The causality is functional but lacks a "because/therefore" tightening; the solution is discovered rather than earned through failure or adaptation. Closure is achieved, but the ease of the resolution reduces its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "tourist" structure: desire, journey, answer, return, with zero obstruction or complication. Closure is achieved through a gift from the universe rather than a decisive action with a paid cost; the "spatial mutiny" functions merely as a convenient door. The ending explains the resolution ("He had discovered the after") rather than letting it land via narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story achieves legible closure with the decision to seek asylum, but the pivot relies heavily on the ink's convenient property ("rumored to liquefy") rather than strict causality. The narrative arc is primarily reflective, which compresses the "waiting" method into a momentary realization rather than a structural progression.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, but the progression is linear and lacks torque; the ritual proceeds without disruption or surprise. The closure acts as a soft thematic reaffirmation ("dawn victorious") rather than a reconfiguration of stakes with visible, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative lens, successfully gathering fragments, but the closure relies on asserted internal stability ("anchored his own unmoored spirit") rather than a demonstrated shift. The narrative structure is linear and vignette-like, lacking a decisive turning point where the accumulated weight forces a reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance or circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where a found note provides explicit instructions that yield an immediate result. The resolution relies on a "magic solution" (playing the cello triggers the memory) rather than protagonist deduction or struggle, reducing the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure depends on summary ("worked through the night") and montage rather than a continuous scene under pressure, violating the scope default. The resolution is unearned; the plan works instantly with universal community support, lacking the obstacles or reversals required for a causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with a clear goal (take the photo) but lacks causal complication; the device works perfectly without on-page struggle. The "battle" to outlast the night is recounted as backstory summary rather than an active, dramatized conflict within the scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (diagnosis -> fix -> release) that lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure is merely "task complete," which fails to reweight the stakes or leave a lasting mark on the protagonist. The ending rests on a summary of success rather than a dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and reliant on convenience; the resolution hinges on condensation perfectly mimicking a map that matches a specific phrasebook page, which functions as an unearned "explain-everything" device. There is no causality driven by the protagonist’s agency under pressure; she merely observes and accepts a solution provided by the environment. Orientation is clear, but the closure lacks cost, reading as symmetric satisfaction rather than a hard-won truth.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on mechanical telling ("Her motivation burned...", "Her action was...") which disrupts immersion and reads like a prompt checklist. Closure acts as a simple "fix-it" resolution where the problem is solved without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist. The cause-and-effect chain is linear and lacks resistance; the town yields to the magic without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear deadline driving the action. The recontextualization of the distress signal at closure—from a plea for rescue to a courier for the memory—is a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.7)
    The central mechanism creates a causality break: it is physically unclear how placing a lattice over "scuffs" on a door that is already "ajar" allows one to see bodies that have been hidden for decades. The logic of the discovery relies on poetic assertion rather than spatial or narrative coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation and closure are legible, and the causal chain is clear. However, the narrative is strictly linear with no meaningful turning point or deepening; the resolution is immediate upon the character's arrival, lacking structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of task completion (enter, sew, exit) devoid of causal turns or unexpected obstacles. Closure is achieved by simply finishing the intended action; there is no Decisive Change or Reconfiguration of stakes, only the execution of a pre-validated plan.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("On the third morning," "Her method became purposeful wandering") rather than dramatized scenes, reducing immediacy. The inciting incident and climax occur, but the compression flattens the causal linkage into a synopsis-like progression.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear Situational lens, but the closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect solution found via serendipity with no trade-off. The inciting problem (choosing a name) is resolved too neatly by the environment, creating a soft reset that clears the tension without a legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure resembles a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, moving linearly from discovery to resolution without significant obstacles. The pivotal discovery relies on a convenient magical vision ("holding a silver thread... to feel currents") rather than active investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the closure operates as a "soft reset" where the protagonist's burden vanishes instantly without a legible cost. The resolution relies on external validation via the vision, lacking the felt price required for higher-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette (Accumulative Lens) rather than a story with causal progression; the protagonist observes, remembers, and acts without facing an obstacle. The closure—a sleeping boy smiling at whispered words—relies on convenience and sentimentality rather than an earned shift, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory: arrival, setup, successful execution, and departure, lacking any meaningful causal complication or resistance. The "fog as exposed film" concept works instantly as a magic key, removing the potential for failure or adaptation. Closure is achieved through a thematic realization rather than a decisive change in the protagonist's situation or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a heavy coincidence (water droplet striking a spiderweb to reflect sound perfectly onto the nickel) to resolve the central mystery. The climax functions as a Deus Ex Machina where the environment explains the mural’s meaning to the protagonist. Closure is achieved, but the inciting pressure is relieved by magic rather than the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality is broken by a confused timeline; the seed is established as needing to "mature and dry" to function as a signal, yet the climax features "biologically impossible" cicadas singing immediately upon planting. The ending relies on a magical acceleration ("the warp") that resolves the tension without the protagonist earning the victory through the established mechanism. The "warp" operates as a deus ex machina rather than a consequence of the planting.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina—the wind shifting "one night" creates the resolution—rather than causal progression. The "blossom armistice" is achieved through magical coincidence, not earned action. The story functions as a static vignette with a tacked-on epiphany rather than a structured plot with tension and release.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a ritualistic vignette with no inciting incident, complication, or causal deviation from the plan. Closure is merely the completion of a routine task without visible cost, risk, or structural change, failing to create a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a Deus Ex Machina: the ink glows and the words on the parchment physically rearrange themselves into clarity, bypassing the intellectual struggle of translation. This removes the cost of the resolution. The "misinterpretation" backstory is told, not shown, and the closure—instant restoration of trust via a single sentence—feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a convenient *deus ex machina*—a "ghost of a message" in dried adhesive—to instantly resolve the central conflict without setbacks or cost. Causality is broken by the "spectrometer" analysis, which functions as a magic wand to bypass the stated dilemma between preservation and heat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the sensory inciting incident to a decisive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The act of writing in the ledger creates a legible "after" state with the felt cost of losing his anonymity. The "dust mapping" setup feels slightly contrived as a physical mechanic but successfully serves the internal logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is almost entirely static reflection ("Reflection-led mode") with minimal present-action pressure; the protagonist sits, looks, and thinks. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (reframing grief as sacred), the lack of active obstacles or hard choices makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The causal chain is internal and associative, lacking the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette where the resolution relies on the coincidental appearance of fireflies to trigger an epiphany. The causal link between the feather ritual and the realization is thematic rather than structural, lacking a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal line—hypothesis, test, confirmation, conceptual repricing—and lands a coherent closure. However, the narrative is linear and low-tension; the "race" against memory fading is stated but not dramatized as an active obstacle, making the resolution feel like a smooth procedure rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a predictable "plan-execute-succeed" linearity without complication, reversal, or unexpected variables. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the protagonist gets exactly what he wants in the way he wants it—which deflates tension and leaves the "orchestrated" outcome feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "task completion" structure where the ritual proceeds without obstruction, deviation, or risk of failure. The resolution—Elara's sudden release from her "anchor"—feels asserted as a reward for the task rather than a consequence earned through a hard-won struggle or choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative structure is a linear sequence of observations lacking causal pressure or a decisive turning point. The ending provides a sense of emotional cadence ("buoyant and clear") but fails the cost proof test; the protagonist sacrifices nothing (time, comfort, belief) to achieve her realization. It reads as a vignette rather than a story with a structural arc of tension and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a static "walking and thinking" structure where the inciting incident and climax are purely internal and lack external pressure. The ending (Conceptual Repricing) feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance; he simply reflects until he reaches a positive conclusion. Causality is soft, driven by authorial intent rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of success without complication; the resolution (village saved) is earned by magic ritual rather than struggle. Closure brings "revitalization" and peace to the protagonist rather than a Decisive Change with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery path that relies on convenience (the "resonance" pulling her to the exact spot) rather than causal agency. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and transforms her stance from curiosity to covenant, the lack of obstacles makes the journey feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (arrive, sing, fix, fade) without significant causal complications or unexpected turns. While the closure (fading away, child waking) is legible, the lack of obstacles makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned. It reads more as a ritual enactment than a dramatic arc with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a legible Causal drive; the confession leads directly to the resolution. The closure (resignation as anchor) is a strong Decisive Change with conceptual cost, though the swift acceptance by the opposing elder slightly weakens the causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with clear orientation and a decisive closure event that lands with tangible cost (the loss of the unique egg). The causal chain supports a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist integrates his loss; the pacing effectively mirrors the "lull" of the thunder.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (arrival, resistance, unlocking) that effectively dramatizes the ritual. However, the progression feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle; the sequence operates smoothly without significant setbacks or complications to test the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies almost exclusively on the "reflection-led mode," offering a static summary of a past argument and a present realization without active scene pressure. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the lack of present-tense causality makes the epiphany feel like an intellectual exercise rather than a dramatic event.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid with a clear inciting incident and definitive closure via Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality holds well, with the arrival of the butterfly forcing a distinct pivot that integrates the setup (the wing) seamlessly into the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path with clear orientation and closure. However, the plot lacks a distinct turning point or obstacle; the protagonist arrives, succeeds, and leaves. The cost is relegated to backstory ("shattered bell") rather than being paid on the page, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a "vision sequence" deus ex machina to resolve the central conflict, explaining the plot to the character instead of letting her drive it. Closure is achieved through a convenient, cost-free epiphany where the directive's destruction is framed as an instant, perfect gain.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is strictly linear and lacks a causal turn or complication; the protagonist prepares, acts without obstruction, and succeeds immediately. The closure relies on an "explain-everything" realization that resolves the premise intellectually without dramatizing a shift in power or knowledge through action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a magical healing trope where touching an object resolves the central conflict without cost or complication. Causality is replaced by asserted epiphany ("Cellular memory flooded him"), and the resolution ("resentment dissolved like mist") is too tidy, bypassing the difficult work of forgiveness. The ending offers a "Resonant Reconfiguration" in form, but lacks the requisite felt cost to make the closure resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of uninterrupted success with no meaningful reversals or distinct cost at closure. The story relies on "magical efficiency" where the protagonist's intent immediately yields results (she breathes, the fog glows), resulting in symmetric satisfaction that lacks dramatic weight. The ending resolves the premise neatly but fails to enact the required "Resonant Reconfiguration" or "Decisive Change" with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.9)
    A significant causality error disrupts the climax: Elara finds the ribbon in a "forgotten" bag sealed for years, yet Lyra claims to have followed a letter sealed with "this very ribbon," creating an impossible timeline. The resolution relies on this teleporting prop and a coincidental arrival, undermining the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving cleanly from failure to reflection to success. However, the resolution feels mechanical—the ledger explicitly updating at the end is a tidy, video-game-like closure that lacks narrative weight. The causality is internal (mindset shift), which is valid, but the execution is linear and lacks the complexity or setbacks expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear fable logic with legible closure, but the causal chain relies on abstract assertions ("renegotiate the mountain’s sentient pathways") rather than grounded mechanics. The resolution hinges on a verbal reframe that feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a convenient *deus ex machina*—finding the journal with the exact thematic answer—to resolve the central conflict. While the closure (dropping the card) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, the causal chain leading to it feels contrived rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a strictly linear procedural structure: anomaly found, obscure solution recalled, ritual performed, order restored. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the door simply vanishes; while the story claims a conceptual cost (honoring loss), it is not felt by the protagonist or dramatized as a sacrifice. The causality is functional but lacks the complications or tightening necessary for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central problem—a lost ritual—is solved by a convenient epiphany triggered by a visual cue, bypassing the need for earned deduction or trial. The ending resolves the "weaponized storm" with a symmetric satisfaction ("storm ceased... contentment") that feels mechanically tidy and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the beacon lighting) is decisive, fulfilling the prompt's structural requirements. However, the path to resolution is linear and lacks causal complications; the retrocognitive vision removes ambiguity exactly when tension should peak. The "cost" of the closure is minimal, reading more as a procedural success than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on a soft "bold conjecture" that instantly resolves the central problem without testing or failure; she decides the fog is a canvas, and the world immediately complies. The causality feels frictionless, moving from observation to epiphany to total success without a moment of doubt or external resistance. The closure is legible but feels unearned due to this ease of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and low-stakes, moving from arrival to discovery without a significant reversal or causal tightening. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the discovery (lighting a knot to see a tile) minimizes the narrative achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    The scene possesses a clear arc and achieves closure via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causality is soft. The resolution depends entirely on Kael interpreting the crab's movement exactly as Elara does at the exact same moment, which feels like convenient synchronization rather than earned drive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure unit (placing the doll in the sprout) serves as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the progression is linear and low-tension; the environment ("xenial trellis") is explicitly hospitable, removing obstacles that would force a causal turn. The story operates on dream logic where external events (the sprout) perfectly mirror internal needs without causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is complete and the closure is legible under a Situational lens, but the resolution lacks cost; the grief is resolved too neatly by a single conversation. Orientation is handled well, but the causality is weak—Leo changes state because the plot dictates it, not because a difficult choice or significant price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a convenient epiphany ("understanding dawned with the sun") that resolves the conflict without a felt cost. The ending explains the solution and theme explicitly rather than dramatizing a causal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution relies on a "soft magic" fix where a breathing exercise instantly repairs a supernatural breach, lacking sufficient causal friction or cost. The plot follows a linear, therapeutic logic that feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with minimal resistance; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or dilemma, as the "Convergence" simply allows her to succeed. The climax (channeling pressure into the bolt) is resolved via magical convenience rather than a tactic that demands a trade-off. Closure is achieved, but the lack of prior obstacle makes the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "scavenger hunt" logic where the protagonist faces a puzzle and solves it immediately without setback. The mechanism of dust settling into "standing waves" of a song from memory strains causality and reads as a convenient magical solution. Closure relies on a "letter dump" that explains the theme rather than dramatizing the realization through action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear progression with minimal resistance; the "shifting geometries" are solved too easily by the dance, acting as a convenience rather than a pressure test. The ending is a "fix-everything" resolution (night turns to dawn, solitude to strength) that dissolves all conflict without a legible, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's worldview. However, the inciting discovery relies on a physically dubious "dust pattern" method, and the resolution comes without cost or obstacle—she finds the object immediately and is healed by it. The lack of causal friction or complications softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is achieved through a decisive act, but the causal logic relies on convenient "handwavium"—specifically, the lagoon reflecting 8mm projection into "dormant satellites" as data. This technical leap breaks the narrative's grounded tone and resolves the plot through unearned magical physics rather than character agency within established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where success feels inevitable; the "prophecy" offers only abstract resistance. Closure arrives as a completed task without a decisive change in the protagonist's stance or a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic sequence (wait, catch, place, feel) without causal friction or deviation. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" of stated transformation ("emerged transformed always") rather than a specific, earned change in stance or circumstance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is complete and linear, but causality relies heavily on convenience (the latch revealed by shifting foliage, the clue falling into place). The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, but the ease of the journey undermines the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence with no obstacles or deviations; the magic functions perfectly on the first attempt, dissolving tension. Closure relies on a "soft reset" where the repair of an object instantly fixes complex grief, lacking an earned sense of causality or price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution (Cora’s release). However, the progression feels procedural rather than causal; the resolution is achieved without complications or setbacks, making the closure feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The accumulative structure is legible, tracing a path from sensory inputs to memory, but the causality is associative (twig snap leads to laughter) rather than strictly logical. Closure is reached via a Conceptual Repricing (strap as compass), but the cost is low, as the resolution comes from easy realizations rather than difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path: arrival, observation, realization, and placement of the artifact. Orientation is stable, and the closure (leaving the shard) is a valid action. However, the progression lacks causal density; the "translation" process meets no resistance, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is mechanically sound, with a clear linear progression from entry to resolution. However, the reliance on a sudden psychic flash to explain the backstory (the "empathic memory") acts as a plot shortcut, bypassing the need for genuine narrative discovery. The closure is clean but feels unearned due to this lack of causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure—preparation, execution, result—without causal complications or doubt. The "rupture" provides a structural climax, but the resolution is too tidy ("evolved it"), removing tension by converting potential catastrophe into immediate improvement without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "silver bullet" resolution where a single demonstration instantly overturns decades of dispute. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—total victory with no felt cost or sacrifice—failing to generate the friction required for a resonant literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path to a "soft reset" ending where the protagonist's vitality is fully restored, negating the cost. The resolution relies on a "magic word" climax ("Return") rather than a causal pivot derived from the established mechanics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (refusal to sample) lands with conceptual weight. However, the pivot relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the psychometric vision) to deliver the epiphany, bypassing causal struggle in favor of a sudden download of wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and low-stakes, with a "soft reset" closure where the storm conveniently abates as the carving is finished (pathetic fallacy). The resolution is an internal epiphany stated by the narrator ("fear into faith") rather than a change earned through high-cost choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a predictable resolution without causal complications or setbacks. The ending relies on an "explain-everything" realization where the meaning is fully articulated in thought, reducing narrative tension. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it lacks the requisite "felt cost" or sacrifice to give the insight weight.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal logic relies on an unearned magical convenience; Elias suddenly gains telekinetic influence over the past without established rules or cost. While the sequence is legible, the resolution (fixing history by pushing stones with his mind) feels like a "cheat" that bypasses the difficulty of the premise. Closure is achieved, but the "official record" paradox remains unaddressed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, gathering memories to fuel a decisive closing action (burying the bottle) that successfully reconfigures the story's reality (Resonant Reconfiguration). Orientation is excellent, though the progression lacks a moment of doubt or complication to heighten the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    A critical causality break undermines the narrative: the artifact physically cannot contain both the foghorn's "final note" (recorded one hour ago) and a field trip from seventy years ago. The central revelation relies on this impossible chronology, breaking the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—setup, ritual, success—without a decisive turn or complication. Success is immediate upon completing the ritual steps, lacking a moment of risk or failure. The closure offers a thematic realization but lacks a legible cost; the "tear freezing" explicitly negates sorrow/price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clear and the refusal to act (Earned Stasis) provides legible closure, but the immediate validation from Abbot Theron robs the decision of any lasting weight or cost. The ending feels too tidy, functioning more as a parable where virtue is instantly rewarded rather than a drama with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a static vignette structure (observation -> affirmation) rather than a causal arc; the "meteor" incident intensifies the mood but does not force a decision or change the status quo. Closure is circular rather than transformative; Elian begins reverent and ends reverent, with no "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that carries a visible price. The lack of meaningful opposition flattens the trajectory into a philosophical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc (vigil -> recognition -> release) with stable orientation. However, the turning point—Elias finally noticing the recluse—feels like a function of time passing rather than a specific causal trigger or escalated pressure. Closure is achieved, but it reads as "symmetric satisfaction" (everyone finds peace) with no visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and relies heavily on the coincidence of Elara’s arrival at the exact moment of Kael's dissolution to secure closure. The lack of causal obstacles turns the plot into a procedural execution of a plan rather than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on the convenient discovery of the feather rather than causal action. Closure is achieved through simple completion of a task with no felt cost or narrative tension, resulting in a flat vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary montage ("Weeks deepened into months") rather than scenic causality, distancing the reader from the pivotal moments. Closure is legible and resonant, but the path to it feels like a synopsis rather than a dramatized event.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a significant deus ex machina: Elias is summoned by magical footprints appearing on his desk, which breaks the established scientific/grounded reality and removes his agency. The narrative is linear and lacks a meaningful causal turn; the resolution is a convenient meeting where both parties simply agree, resulting in symmetric satisfaction without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist without causal resistance; the resolution relies on an unearned temporal distortion—a seed sprouting immediately after planting—that breaks the established realism for convenient closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.7)
    The puzzle resolution relies on a "memory ex machina" where a flashback provides the exact instruction needed, bypassing active experimentation. The causal chain is weak; the protagonist succeeds because he remembers a line of dialogue, not because he adapts tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to realization, but the closure relies on a "pure win" discovery without a clearly dramatized cost. The transition from confusion to "thrilling hypothesis" happens instantly upon the glimpse, lacking the causal struggle or meaningful trade-off required for higher bands. The resolution feels convenient rather than inevitable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, checklist-like structure (arrive, enter, swap pieces, succeed) with no complications or twists. While orientation is clear, the causality is mechanical—action A yields result B immediately. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction" (swapping bad for good) rather than a decisive turn that generates narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear accumulation (ritual spelling of words) that leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the progression lacks causal resistance; the ritual succeeds perfectly on the first attempt without obstacle or deviation. The ending relies on a magical-realist assertion of transformation ("shadows... vessels") that feels earned by the ritual's completion but lacks a visceral, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative arc is functional and complete, moving efficiently from problem to magical solution to resolution. However, the structure is linear and relies on convenient instruction ("Ancient marginalia described the necessary action") rather than protagonist ingenuity testing the world. The closure is legible as a Decisive Change, but the path to it feels like following a checklist rather than navigating genuine causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on symbolic convenience rather than earned causality; the solution hinges on the arbitrary coincidence that a village's founding tapestry contains the specific chess counter-move Kael needs. The "lock and key" logic is dream-like and lacks a grounded mechanism, making the resolution feel inevitable and unearned. Closure is achieved, but the path there avoids genuine complication or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "speech converts the antagonist" resolution that lacks causal weight or earned change. The climax dissolves tension instantly through a convenient agreement, resulting in a fable-like structure devoid of hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure relies on abstract assertion ("Meaning had been conjured") and a magical calming of the sea that undercuts the physical reality of the threat. The causality between the repair ritual and the cessation of the workshop's destruction feels unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot hinges on a convenient accident (the "wrong turn" fall) that deposits the protagonist exactly where he needs to be, undermining agency. Closure is achieved through a declared internal realization ("he understood") rather than a dramatic change in options or legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where the action (uncorking a vial) leads immediately to total validation without obstacle or cost. The causality breaks credibility; the scent traveling against wind and height to trigger a specific epiphany reads as magical convenience, not earned narrative logic. Closure is unearned, lacking the required "Decisive Change" with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent under a ritualistic lens, but the progression relies on external instructions (the phone) rather than protagonist agency. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the resolution feels unearned due to the lack of prior obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procurement structure with no causal turn or unexpected complication in the ravine; she arrives, finds the truffle, and leaves. The flashback to the checkpoint halts momentum, and the lack of immediate obstruction leaves the closure feeling inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, moving efficiently from the discovery of the token to a resonant conceptual closure. While the scope is limited to a vignette, the "investigation" coheres under the established lens, and the recontextualization of the object provides a valid sense of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc relies on coincidence (the ants appearing exactly when needed) and a pathetic fallacy (the storm clearing instantly upon success) to resolve the conflict. This bypasses genuine causality and reduces the closure to a convenient magical outcome without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure, and the ending delivers a valid Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's duty. However, the climax relies on an external magical revelation ("The dripping light responded") rather than the protagonist's ingenuity or tactical adaptation, softening the causal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a procedural vignette rather than a causal story; the ritual proceeds without obstacle or error. The closure acts as a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by external magic, lacking the felt cost or resistance required for a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution creates a causality break: the protagonist resolves the central conflict via automatic writing while asleep, stripping the climax of conscious agency. The ending relies on a message delivered *ex machina* rather than wisdom wrestled from the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving from a clear problem (broken clamp) to a resolution (repair and relief). However, the structure is linear and low-stakes; the solution faces no significant obstacles or complications, resulting in a predictable trajectory. The closure lands as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of Elara's self-perception, but it feels intellectually asserted rather than viscerally earned by the plot's events.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is legible, and the central mechanic (stress crystallizes ink, a tear melts it) functions clearly to drive the plot. However, the resolution is linear and convenient; the superstition acts as an instant magical key that unlocks the problem without complication, reducing the climax to a simple transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, with the logging functioning as a ticking clock. However, the progression is frictionless; the resolution feels inevitable from the moment she sits at the piano, lacking a moment of doubt or causal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic checklist (Step 1, Step 2, Climax) that feels structurally safe. While the spiral path provides a clear spine, the resolution ("I am") resolves the central crisis instantly without unexpected causal cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The countdown structure provides a perfect narrative arc for a short piece, creating intrinsic pressure and pacing. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's understanding of his life's work fundamentally shifts. The pacing is tight, and the causality (ritual → epiphany) holds firm under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where a convenient stranger provides the exact key to the protagonist's internal conflict. The climax—shining a laser through a wall—lacks physical stakes or doubt, as the success is immediate and the "test" feels like a backdrop for the metaphor. Closure is achieved through a sudden, unearned conceptual realization triggered by the stranger's speech rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The structure is a linear scavenger hunt with no causal resistance; the protagonist moves from point A to B following instructions without complication. The closure relies on a "magical" genre shift (the lantern revealing a physical door) that feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality. The drive lens is accumulative but lacks pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative arc is linear with low friction; the resolution relies on a "magic words" speech that instantly resolves the antagonist's deep grief without visible cost or complication. The closure is a gain-gain transaction lacking the required felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence without causal resistance or complications; the wind lifting the paper is a helpful coincidence rather than a pressure test. The resolution—a sudden shift from "lead to light"—reads as a soft reset where the character declares a change has occurred without a dramatized cost or decision process.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on explanation rather than causality; the climax is announced by the narrator ("This was the precise timeframe when the story changed") rather than enacted. The resolution feels inevitable and low-stakes, as the protagonist gives away an item she already deemed "absurd" without facing a significant dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot is a linear procession from entry to arrival with no meaningful obstacles or deviation; the ring solves navigation instantly. The closure relies on a "magic feather" realization—arrival at the coordinates instantly resolves the grief without a visible price or difficult choice on the page. The causality is weak because success is inevitable once she steps onto the path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from regret to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of her past error. The single-scene scope works well, and the orientation within the anomaly is sufficient for the genre. However, the causality hinges on a symbolic action (unbending the pen) that triggers a somewhat magical resolution, which feels convenient rather than strictly earned by the pressure established.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies entirely on a coincidental encounter to resolve the central conflict of isolation, lacking a protagonist-driven decision or cost. The closure acts as a "soft reset" where external validation cures the character's exile without earning the shift through struggle, rendering the resolution unearned. The arrival of the child is a deus ex machina that simplifies rather than complicates the predicament.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, fulfilling the "Resonant Reconfiguration" requirement. However, the climax relies on a convenient memory arrival ("A memory surged") to solve the central puzzle, reducing the causal weight of the protagonist's on-page efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc forms a complete loop with legibility, moving from the setup of the ritual to a successful but transient climax and finally to Earned Stasis. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's resolve. However, the sequence is linear and lacks a sharp causal turn; the outcome proceeds exactly as intended without unexpected complication or cost beyond the inherent transience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the solution (a hidden whispering gallery accessed by a mysterious key) feels convenient and lacks established causality. The resolution is a "magic feather" moment that validates the protagonist without forcing a difficult trade-off or adaptation. Orientation is clear, but the plot operates more as a fable than a causal narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the causal mechanism of the climax—weaving shutters to frame a constellation—operates on poetic abstraction rather than narrative logic or physical plausibility. The resolution is unearned; the immediate dissolution of a "deep secret" upon seeing a star pattern feels like a symmetric satisfaction shortcut that bypasses necessary struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("For weeks, students transformed...") rather than dramatized scenes with causal pressure. The climax—placing the grotto—lacks tension because the outcome (town acceptance) feels pre-ordained and unthreatened.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on a magical solution to resolve a psychological conflict, lacking a true Decisive Change where options are weighed. The ending provides a "happy ending" realization that feels unearned, acting as an explanation of the mechanics rather than a resonant closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc within a single scene, ending with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (the shift in perspective regarding grief). While the closure lands effectively, the realization is somewhat over-explained in the final paragraphs rather than being allowed to resonate purely through the image of the bird and flowers.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality is muddied by the opening line stating the ban was lifted hours ago, which undercuts the necessity of the poet's subsequent effort to dissolve the boundary. The narrative follows a linear, obstacle-free path—arrive, speak, succeed—lacking the required tension or decisive change with felt cost. Closure is purely additive ("peace bloomed") rather than a reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on a "soft reset" closure where internal conflict evaporates without cost or difficulty. The ending is an "explain-everything" moment where characters articulate the theme to each other, resolving the tension through mutual affirmation rather than decisive action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a magical solution (prism-song) instantly resolves a scientific problem without causal logic or cost. The resolution relies on the "magic" of the bells simply working because the theme demands it, bypassing genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible before/after state, but the resolution relies on a "soft reset" where grief dissolves largely because of a prepared gift. The cause-and-effect chain is functional but lacks the friction of a true struggle against the protagonist's limits.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot functions as a linear vignette of comfort with no causal friction or orientation debt, but it fails the closure requirement for "felt cost." The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem (Leo's grief) is solved instantly by Elara's explanation, leaving no mark or price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear objective and a legible "Decisive Change" at closure where the protagonist shifts from historian to guardian. However, the resolution relies on an internal, abstract process ("poured understanding") that feels slightly convenient, lacking a rugged causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative structure hinges on a passive investigation phase where the protagonist watches archival footage to resolve the central mystery. While the orientation is clear, the low-stakes resolution—where the antagonist immediately proves benevolent—dissolves tension without a decisive, costly action in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a static scene of reflection with no immediate on-page pressure; the inciting incident occurs in backstory. The resolution (sketching a latch) is intellectually derived from the summary rather than earned through causal interaction or accumulation of weight. The drive lens is ambiguous, drifting between list-like reflection and static description.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.7)
    The resolution breaks causality by relying on a coincidence (accidental telepathy) to solve the central emotional problem. The closure is a "soft reset" of the protagonist's worldview, delivered via summary ("True closure was not...") rather than earned through narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.7)
    The resolution relies heavily on coincidence; the busker singing the exact thematic answer ("love that sets you free") at the critical moment is a deus ex machina that undercuts the protagonist's agency. The narrative arc is linear and lacks a meaningful reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with no genuine obstacle or complication; the protagonist attempts the cure and succeeds immediately. Causality is soft and magical, lacking a decisive turning point where the outcome is in doubt or a price is paid. The ending offers a tidy "Resonant Reconfiguration," but it feels unearned because the "prison" offered no resistance to the key.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.4)
    The structure is linear and vignette-like, lacking a decisive change or meaningful tightening of pressure. The narrative follows a "processional" logic (arrival, ritual, success, departure) where the outcome is never in doubt. Closure is an "Earned Stasis" of continuing the mission, but it feels low-stakes because the opposing force (the void) provides no active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest with no obstacles; the wind guides Kael "unerringly," removing all uncertainty. The ending creates Symmetric Satisfaction (problem solved -> peace achieved) without the required visible or felt cost. The structure relies on convenience (perfect gear match) rather than causality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes tour structure where obstacles are resolved immediately by the guides' intervention (e.g., the "steep ascent" is solved by a touch and a whisper). Causality is weak; the ending is a "gift" of realization handed to the protagonist rather than a consequence of her own agency or a paid cost, resulting in a lack of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear causal chain leading to a decisive closure (placing the bolt). The discovery of the trigger via "Aris Thorne’s journal" is well-justified by her auditing assignment, avoiding a potential logic gap. The ending provides a Resonant Reconfiguration of the fortress's rules with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and backstory ("Centuries prior," "Kael’s vigil spanned") rather than a dramatized scene with causal friction. The abrupt shift to Elara in the Throne Room breaks the single-POV default and relocates the climax away from the protagonist, turning Kael into a passive observer of his own victory. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through an on-page struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a low-causality "unlock" mechanic where a specific rhythm triggers a comprehensive explanation, solving the central mystery without cost. The transition from grief to purpose is instantaneous and unearned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette where the environment solves the protagonist's internal problem without agency or cost. The closure—a decision to tell stories—feels disconnected from the "shattered ideals" and acts as a soft reset of the conflict rather than a consequence of action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and frictionless, moving from discovery to resolution without setbacks or meaningful complications. The closure fails the cost requirement; the pine tree immediately validating her choice removes the risk of breaking tradition, leaving the happy ending unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "symptom-and-cure" structure that lacks causal pressure or meaningful turns. Closure is a soft landing into stasis (watering plants) achieved without visible cost or narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the causality relies on dream logic where internal states directly manipulate external reality without resistance. The resolution—simply untangling a physical knot to fix reality—bypasses the need for a complex narrative cost. Closure is present but feels mechanically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality collapses at the climax: Kael concludes that "time does not slow physically" and is merely a cognitive trick, yet the drone physically time-travels and vanishes, contradicting his realization. Additionally, the inciting incident relies on a massive coincidence—the wind spilling ink into the exact patterns of the eclipse dust—rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "secretly restored" network functions as a convenient backstory solution that lowers difficulty. The confrontation with Kael lacks genuine pressure; he is easily deceived with a single line, resolving the scene without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc or inciting incident; it describes a routine without disrupting it. There is no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration, as the "ritual" is merely a repetition of established habits without a specific, high-stakes test today.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist is "remade." The pacing is solid, though the resolution—peace washing over the garden—feels somewhat tidy ("healing light"), lacking a sharper, grittier cost to balance the ease of the fix.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands with a definitive action (publishing), but the investigation relies on a significant plausibility gap: the police fabricated weather details yet left the contradictory maintenance log and nib evidence accessible for 30 years. The logical victory feels unearned because the counter-narrative (the police report) is fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual structure (instruction → action → result) that achieves a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causality relies heavily on dream logic ("amber holds time") and convenient discovered instructions, lacking a sense of earned difficulty or necessary complication.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, but the plot lacks causal friction; the magic system yields immediately to the protagonist's will. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of resolution lowers the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks a causal engine; the resolution ("retrocognitive trap shattered") is a "soft reset" that cures a decades-long condition without cost or process. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction where the physical act creates a magical psychological fix, bypassing necessary narrative struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B path where the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without resistance or complication. While the ending provides closure (Elara dissolves), the "symmetric satisfaction" feels unearned because the "brink of despair" is stated but never dramatized as an opposing force. The ending explains the resolution rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving logically from the inciting shock to the closure image. However, the connection between the static shock, the pill, and the geode is delivered via narrator explanation ("acted as a catalyst") rather than emerging purely through action, softening the causal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure, but the causality relies heavily on the "factually mystical" premise, which bypasses logical pressure. The closure—completing the map and hiding the fossil—is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel like a procedural completion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on a low-cost "conceptual repricing" where a mental shift instantly resolves a physical geological threat. While the logic of reframing the prophecy is clear, the lack of obstacles or failed attempts makes the resolution feel convenient and magical rather than earned. The transition from danger to resolution is too smooth, lacking the friction of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on the convenient arrival of Anya to generate a scene, rather than causal progression. While the closure (emotional thaw) is legible, the lack of obstacle or complication makes the plot feel linear and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is static, relying on a convenient "pathetic fallacy" where the fog lifts in sync with an internal realization, undercutting causal agency. The closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist reinterprets his failure as success without paying a visible or felt cost. The pacing is dictated by the prompt's rain-gutter clock rather than organic narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is linear and legible but lacks causal tension or an inciting incident that forces a difficult choice; the protagonist performs a ritual and receives an epiphany without obstacle. The closure functions as a conceptual shift, but without a visible or felt cost paid on the page, the resolution feels unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is coherent, following a clear linear path from the trigger (petal) to the ritual and its effect. Orientation is solid, and the closure lands as a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the alley's atmosphere. However, the plot lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes; the progression is inevitable rather than causal, resulting in a low-tension vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a meaningful obstacle, reversal, or deepening; the ritual succeeds instantly without complication. Closure offers a "perfect success" resolution with emotional release but no visible, felt cost or trade-off. The brevity (~420 words) prevents the development of genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative compresses the construction of a large-scale installation and the arrival of multiple strangers into a single twilight window, straining causal credibility. While the closure lands on a conceptual level, the progression lacks the necessary friction or obstacles to make the final "reconfiguration" feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the resolution relies on a "magic button" device (the transmitter) that instantly solves the complex external conflict. While Aris accepts the cost of his job, the lack of struggle during the climax dampens the narrative satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the resolution hinges on a *Deus Ex Machina*—a specific journal instruction remembered at the perfect moment. Closure is tidy and overly positive ("The fallow period would end") with minimal felt cost; the protagonist's success feels inevitable rather than earned through sacrifice or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on a significant convenience—a "miraculously preserved" journal sitting under a rock for a decade—to resolve the central mystery. The path to discovery is linear and lacks obstacles, resulting in a low-friction plot.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on significant contrivances, particularly the mechanics of the nail (verdigris matching ink color) and the "National Treasure"-style physical decoding. The coincidence of the tsunami arriving exactly as the code is cracked undermines causal agency. The transition from discovery to evacuation is rushed, lacking a believable chain of persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of observations lacking causal pressure or distinct beats. Closure acts as a "soft reset," resolving deep grief instantly through a convenient epiphany without visible cost or logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    The scene possesses a clear arc and valid closure (the renunciation of the money), but the inciting arrival of Kai relies on a convenient coincidence ("I had to find you") that feels contrived. The narrative structure is competent but relies on a "white room" conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a "lock-and-key" coincidence where the mentor's telegram arrives at the precise moment of impasse to provide the solution. While the closure is legible as a conceptual reconfiguring, the causality is weak because the protagonist does not earn the resolution through on-page trial, error, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a ritualistic checklist (four expanding circles) that dissolves the obstacle without escalating pressure or forcing a difficult choice. The climax functions as a soft reset, where a simple apology instantly negates the "malevolent" vortex without material cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    The plot is a linear progression of ritual steps that lacks causal friction or genuine obstacles; the protagonist faces no active opposition that forces a change in tactics. The resolution relies on a "magic key" solution where the clipping simply fixes the rift, resulting in a low-stakes outcome. The narrative structure serves merely to house the required elements rather than to dramatize a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path with no significant obstacles; the "barter" succeeds because the plot demands it, not through causal necessity or earned tactical shifts. While closure is technically achieved, the resolution relies on magical convenience and lacks the friction required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, coherent arc from shame to a Decisive Change (abandoning the auction house for storytelling). The flashback is standard but functional. Closure is legible and structurally sound, though the magnitude of the life pivot feels slightly unearned by the brief interaction with the object.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a solid Causal/Accumulative hybrid path, moving from the failure of the instrument to the analogical leap and final planting. Closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's goal is redefined. The inciting failure and the climactic action are well-linked, though the "analogical thinking" solution feels slightly like a master-key introduced to solve the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without causal complication or a decisive turning point. The ending is a soft reset (loop) that fails to provide a legible cost or a resonant reconfiguration of stakes, resulting in a lack of structural closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that adheres to a fable-like structure. Closure is achieved via a Resonant Reconfiguration (leaving the pearl), though the lack of external obstacles makes the progression feel somewhat inevitable and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pivot relies on the "graffiti as oracle" trope, which acts as a convenient deus ex machina to solve the protagonist's trauma. The closure is a "neat" conceptual repricing (leaving the map) but lacks significant causal pressure leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is sound, with a legible Decisive Change at the climax where she moves from documenting to speaking. However, the puzzle of the library is solved with low resistance; the "fierce" secrets yield to simple observation in seconds, making the middle section feel linear and inevitable rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the pressure of the Archive to the sacrificial propagation of the seed. The closure is decisive and lands with the visible cost of the destroyed violin. The prophecy mechanism, while functional, somewhat lowers the tension by removing the risk of the unknown before the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: setup, wait, act, succeed. While the closure (capturing the spark) is distinct, the lack of a causal reversal or significant obstacle makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence but lacks causal pressure or a meaningful turning point with visible cost. The inciting incident (forgiving) occurs off-page, and the climax is a low-stakes ritual action. Closure is achieved through abstract realization rather than a decisive change in options or status.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is functional and the closure unit (Decisive Change via unhooking) is legible, but the resolution is unearned. Kael's surrender of a decades-long burden occurs too easily after a brief exchange, making the ending feel like a "soft reset" without sufficient causal pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure effectively supports the meditative arc, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure. While the "spiral" trigger is slightly convenient, the internal logic of the realization holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear arc from observation to epiphany to resolution, achieving a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist becomes the anchor. However, the plot relies on a convenient natural event (the bifurcation) that perfectly mirrors the problem, and the solution is executed without complication or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is sound, following a clear Causal/Accumulative path to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands with a legible conceptual cost—accepting social alienation for inner purpose. The "weeks passed" transition dissipates some tension but serves the thoughtful, garden-focused ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies heavily on a convenient coincidence: finding a specific logbook that explicitly answers an abstract synesthetic question with poetic exactness. This "magic book" resolution bypasses the need for the protagonist to earn his insight, and the narrative beats feel like a checklist (enter, find key, read log, change) rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a Situational/Accumulative lens, functioning as a vignette where a ritual resolves a stated mood. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the lack of causal obstacles or genuine risk flattens the arc. The story moves in a straight line from doubt to acceptance without a decisive turning point that alters options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, complete arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the structure is processional and linear (Monster A, then B, then C), which flattens tension; the ritual proceeds without complication or unexpected error. Orientation and causality are solid, but the "and-then" sequencing limits dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and solidly structured, with a clear causal link between the method (drops) and the resolution (bell rings). The pacing is linear and methodical, fitting the "process" focus, though it lacks a distinct twist or complication to heighten the narrative drive before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with clear causality linking the wind chime signal to the recovery of the bottle. The closure—subverting the bureaucratic definition of "expunge"—lands effectively, though the inciting coincidence of the wind chime feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina—the convenient appearance of the birds solves the central conflict instantly—rather than causal progression. The ending offers a "perfect synthesis" without the required felt or conceptual cost; the protagonist succeeds completely without tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear but the resolution is too convenient; the "arbor as corrective lens" logic is vague, and the antagonist (the error) is resolved instantly without resistance. The closure lacks a felt cost; admission of failure is met with immediate, warm validation, neutralizing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks a true obstacle; the protagonist resolves the central tension by touching the jar, meeting no opposition. The external context ("history rewriting") is disconnected from the causal chain of the scene, serving as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative relies on a summary time-jump ("Weeks turned to months") to bypass the actual struggle of nurturing, dissolving tension. The seed's arrival and the protagonist's immediate, correct interpretation create a linear path with no causal complications. Closure is an unearned validation of the protagonist's existing worldview with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a distinct beginning, middle, and end that fits the short scope perfectly. The closure is resonant, shifting the house's atmosphere and the survivors' grief through a specific, earned on-page moment that feels structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is excellent, with a clear inciting incident (the rift) and a decisive moment of closure (renunciation). The ending lands as an Earned Stasis, where the refusal to return is a proactive choice that validly reconfigures the character's relationship to the setting and the self.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative pivots on an unearned epiphany ("When the penny dropped") that resolves the central conflict without causal groundwork. Closure creates a "happy ending" with total victory and no legible cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change with price.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively as Elara shifts from seeker to listener. The logic of the "tuning" holds within the established world, though the lack of external obstacles or failure states keeps tension low. The ending feels earned by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina resolution; the hourglass appears out of nowhere, and the solution is achieved through instant intuition without trial or failure. The ending is a consequence-free hard reset where passengers remain unaware and Leo pays no visible cost, violating the requirement for earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear structure with legible closure (a shift in stance from control to humility). However, causality is weak; the inciting incident (thread jerking) and climax (pattern erupting) are autonomous magical events, leaving the protagonist to react rather than drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear demonstration rather than a plot with causality and consequence; the conflict is resolved by a functional piece of technology rather than character agency. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect, cost-free success—failing the requirement for closure with felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence: the beneficiary (Lily) appears "As if summoned" exactly when the message is decoded, removing logistical friction and agency. The narrative lacks a distinct cost; the resolution is smooth and immediate, solving the problem without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "lock-and-key" progression without a decisive turn that narrows options or forces a difficult choice. Closure is achieved through a successful task completion and stated relief rather than a reconfiguration of stakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is severed by a "magic fix" where physical ink patterns inexplicably resolve a digital server error without established logic. The narrative progression is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or obstacle, leading to a convenient resolution that feels unearned. The closure relies on a literal "verified" screen that clashes with the metaphorical nature of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (observe, translate, speak) without significant causal complications or twists. While the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the central pivot—birds mirroring diamond flaws—relies on asserted coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident (the ritual) and a definitive closure act (hanging up the phone) that forecloses the option of exposure. The cost—sacrificing career redemption—is legible. Orientation is handled well, though the mechanism of the "static" leans heavily on expository dialogue to explain its significance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path of instant success with negligible resistance; the transition from music to total victory feels unearned. The resolution is a "perfect win" that lacks the complexity or proportional cost required for a high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure, but the resolution relies on a magic item that functions perfectly without cost or consequence. The ending offers a thematic wrap-up ("purpose replacing sorrow's weight") rather than a closure unit with felt sacrifice or irreversible change. The absence of a tangible price for using the storm lowers the causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence (landslide) and convenience (finding the exact missing halo fragment in the sawdust immediately). While the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the causal chain leading to it is weak and lacks earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.6)
    Structure relies heavily on a flashback to resolve the central conflict ("Where do stories go?"), which removes agency from the present-day timeline. The ending is an "explain-everything" moment where the answer is gifted via memory rather than earned through a pressure-tested struggle. The closure is a realization without a felt sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist performs a ritual and receives an immediate, convenient epiphany. The resolution ("home was a state of being") is a standard trope of Conceptual Repricing that lacks a felt cost or complication. The connection between the abstract photo and the realization relies on "dream logic" rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual without meaningful causal turns or obstacles; the solution (speaking words of affirmation) is applied without trial or failure. The ending relies on a POV breach (head-hopping to Elara miles away) to provide closure, breaking the established scene window and diluting the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (arrival, wait, ritual, vision) with a "deus ex machina" vision resolving the conflict. The "Decades later" epilogue flattens the immediate closure by summarizing the protagonist's entire future.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from resistance to acceptance within a single scene, and the closure (stepping forward) lands with a clear change in stance. The causality, however, relies on a "soft magic" epiphany where a tea-leaf pattern resolves deep emotional trauma instantly, making the turning point feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural of a magic ritual without causal pressure, resistance, or complication. The outcome is never in doubt, and the closure—planting the seed—lacks a visible, felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is interrupted by an expository paragraph that lists motivation, action, and method in a mechanical sequence, halting immersion. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where the external repair of the net perfectly mirrors the internal repair of the protagonist without causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot is a functional linear investigation, but it lacks causal tension or genuine stakes. The central obstacle (the shadow misalignment) is resolved instantly via convenient "field notes" rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. Closure is tidy and symmetric, lacking the felt cost required for a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, moving from entry to epiphany, but the progression is frictionless. Key plot points occur via convenience ("Later... he found the magnetic tape spool") or summarized time jumps, bypassing potential complications. Closure is achieved, but the causal chain lacks the tension of overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path (wait, carve, leave) lacking a decisive change or meaningful turn. Closure is soft and unearned, relying on an abstract assertion of success ("world subtly transformed") without a visible, felt cost or a reconfiguring of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is functional, but the resolution relies on a convenience (goggles + light) that undermines the premise of a difficult cipher. The closure is a low-cost realization that feels unearned given the ease of the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, using the sequence of clouds to structure the emotional arc effectively. The closure is a valid "Earned Stasis," though the perfect synchronization of weather phenomena with internal states relies heavily on pathetic fallacy, slightly straining causal credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, utilizing a ticking clock (demolition) to pressure the scene. The discovery of the book, while slightly coincidental, is earned by her established tactile sensitivity. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing where she abandons her life’s work for a new understanding, though the pivot relies heavily on a "magic object" mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies heavily on convenient coincidence (starlings aligning perfectly with a dusty board) and a "lock-and-key" resolution with no cost. The closure—restarting the ship—is achieved without sacrifice or difficult choice, making the outcome feel unearned. The narrative follows a linear path where the world arranges itself to be solved.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with convenient plotting; the prophecy is found simply by kneeling in a corner. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved with a tool and a realization, lacking visible cost or a decisive change in options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a "fetch quest" structure where the protagonist is handed the solution by an omniscient guide (Elara) and succeeds on the first attempt without complication. The climax lacks a "try/fail" cycle or any legible cost; the resolution is a symmetric victory where the blight is cured and the ghost is satisfied, resulting in low narrative tension and unearned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, ritualistic structure (Situational Lens) leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure is distinct—the world ends in a lullaby—but the progression feels predetermined by the premise rather than shaped by active problem-solving or turning points on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight and logical, moving from the discovery of the component to the assembly and successful rescue. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "graceless beauty" of the machine recontextualizes her burden. The coincidence of finding the nut exactly at twilight slightly softens the causal hardness, but the assembly beat recovers agency.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a convenient "epiphany from landscape" structure where observing nature instantly resolves deep personal grief. The closure is a "soft reset" achieved through intellectual realization rather than earned action or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is solid, and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shop activates) lands clearly. However, the narrative arc is linear and frictionless; the "lull" dissolves via a successful ritual without a meaningful reversal or complication to test the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear process of discovery and resolution. While closure is achieved through the transmutation of remorse, the arc lacks a significant setback or moment of doubt, resulting in a procedural feel rather than high dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Cause-Effect trajectory, but the progression is flat: problem diagnosed, treated, and solved without complication or reversal. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist encounters no meaningful resistance from the mechanism or the environment. Closure is structurally present but lacks weight, as the stakes are restored without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "success procedural" structure: preparation, action, result, and epiphany, with no obstacles or unexpected turns. The ritual works instantly and perfectly, depriving the story of causal tension or a meaningful inciting incident that disrupts the protagonist's control.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path (observe doodle -> go to grotto -> succeed), lacking a moment of doubt or reversal. The closure is a "mission accomplished" success without a felt cost or a reconfiguring of the status quo; the tears at the end feel unearned by the smooth execution of the task. The orientation is clear, but the trajectory is predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions without causal complication, risk, or deviation. Closure is purely thematic ("silence enriched") and lacks the required visible or felt cost to the protagonist to qualify as a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story functions as a coherent reflective vignette with a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure (reframing exile). However, the narrative drive relies on abstract mental associations ("correlated," "translated") rather than causal action, limiting the sense of momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path—setup, process, success—without a decisive turning point or reversal that forces a trade-off. The closure relies on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (understanding the neighbor), but because the resonator performs the labor of empathy mechanically, the resolution feels unearned by the character’s agency. The orientation is clear, but the lack of causal obstacles flattens the dramatic arc into a scene description.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot depends on a "Weeks passed" time-skip that dissolves tension and bypasses the conflict. Closure is achieved through an asserted internal realization rather than a specific, earned causal sequence or decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (go, find, realize) without significant complication or reversal. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the arrow/mission) is legible, it lacks a felt cost; Kael gains wisdom without sacrificing anything, resulting in a low-stakes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The investigative procedural aspect is logical and grounded in physics, satisfying the causal lens. However, the emotional climax hinges on a "teleporting prop" (the matching patch) which feels like a contrived convenience to force resonance rather than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a ritual with no deviation, obstacle, or reversal; action flows from intention to success without friction. The closure is a simple completion of the task with no legible cost or "Decisive Change" in the protagonist's stance or options. Without complications or a possibility of failure, the plot lacks the causality and tension required for a story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a clear causal chain leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the resolution relies on a convenient magical vision that delivers the insight ready-made, rather than forcing the protagonist to earn it through an active contest or difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where an internal realization instantly dissolves the external threat (the disorientation ceases, a star appears). This "symmetric satisfaction" resolves complex pressure without a felt price or irrevocable change in the protagonist's situation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot lacks a crisis or complication; the protagonist faces a void, uses a tool that works perfectly, and achieves total resolution with no cost. The closure is a "Gift" rather than an earned change, as the "seed" and the epiphany are granted by the magic item rather than forged through decision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the pivotal turn relies on the convenient, immediate arrival of a specific memory to solve the puzzle, weakening the causal chain and reducing the earned weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a clear transformation, but the causality relies on dream logic (puzzle edges "teaching" philosophy) rather than mechanical necessity. The "rummage sale" backstory introduces a jarring modern world logic that contradicts the hermetic, ancient tone of the forest without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path: the protagonist enters a mine, performs a ritual, and succeeds immediately. There is no on-page complication, resistance, or moment where the outcome is in doubt, resulting in a flat causal arc. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned because the price (the barter) was paid off-page prior to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure leads to a valid Conceptual Repricing of the past. However, the resolution relies on a "vision-dump" where the shard reveals the truth directly, rather than the protagonist deducing it through active sensory mapping, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building toward the ritual closure of the "Phoenix Stack." The closure lands with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. A minor causality gap exists: the urgency of the "lamp out" scenario is sidestepped for the symbolic ritual, creating a slight disconnect between his role as a skipper/protector and his actions as a poet/philosopher.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: the laugh summons the storm, and the specific method of steering light resolves it. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the storm into the dawn. However, the resolution is linear and relies on established competence without a moment of doubt or unexpected complication to deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a symbolic leap—sun hitting a wing equals understanding empathy—that substitutes thematic assertion for narrative causality. While the closure (changing her craft) is legible, it lacks a logical dramatic setup or a felt cost; the epiphany arrives essentially ex machina via the environment rather than through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    The scene is a linear vignette that relies on environmental coincidence (the storm breaking at the right moment) rather than causal agency. While closure is achieved, the lack of on-page obstacles or cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear success path where the protagonist attempts a ritual and succeeds without significant setbacks or complications. While the causality is coherent, the lack of a "dark night of the soul" or a moment where failure seems possible flattens the dramatic arc. The closure is a "happy ending" achieved through a single, uninterrupted sequence of actions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal arc, but the climax relies on a "soft reset" where the protagonist discovers her external conflict never truly existed (the members already forgave her). This lowers the narrative tension significantly, as the resolution comes from convenient observation rather than a high-stakes decision with visible cost. The closure is legible, but the lack of friction makes the payoff feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative lacks causal progression; the resolution relies on a significant coincidence (Madame Lin finding the exact recipe in a donated book) that unearnedly fixes the central loss. The structure is a linear sequence of events without a tightening of options or a decisive change in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative procedural arc with legible closure (saving the vow), but the linear progression lacks dramatic torque or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on a list of summarized events ("Later...", "A third false start...") rather than a fully dramatized causal chain, creating a synopsis-like effect. While the closure is decisive and clear, the lack of immediate scene work in the middle section flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path of accumulation (put on ring, walk, taste, realize) without causal pressure or setbacks. The closure relies on a conceptual realization ("She understood") rather than a decision with paid cost, resulting in a low-stakes epiphany that feels inevitable rather than earned. The orientation is clear, but the drive lens is weak because success is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient "magic cave physics" (rocks glowing with birthday numbers) to solve the central puzzle, bypassing causal logic. While the lock-as-key twist attempts a structural turn, the connection between a chest lock found weeks ago and a niche in the cave is tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure relies on summary and "and-then" sequencing (finding map, journey, door, return) rather than a sustained scene with pressure. The climax resolves the mystery conveniently, and the closure—a conceptual realization—feels tidy and lacking in causal friction or orientation density.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of setup, execution, and success without complication, resulting in a vignette rather than a story with a structural pivot. The closure is a soft emotional state (peace) derived from a routine success, lacking a decisive change or a felt cost paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis/Resolution) lands clearly. However, the causal link between a geomagnetic shift and the specific cure of burning a plastic spider relies heavily on symbolic logic that strains suspension of disbelief in a sci-fi setting.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot hinges on a significant logic breach: a "crisp" new letter found inside a mailbox that has been "silent" and locked for sixty years. This "Deus Ex Epistula" resolution bypasses causality for unearned sentiment. Additionally, the timeframe is driven by a convenient city notice that dissolves instantly upon a single plea, lacking narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (she sends the buoy but remains below, accepting her state), but the causal path is weak. The dice rolling "LISTEN" acts as a convenient oracle that solves the central puzzle without improved agency or logic, and the leap from "tide's breath" to "third chime" relies on dream logic rather than earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where obstacles are overcome with ease. The inciting incident (the whale) connects to the plot only through vague thematic association ("felt like a tear") rather than direct causality, weakening the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot follows a mechanical linear path: problem presented, hero arrives, hero solves it instantly, hero leaves. The "symmetric satisfaction" ending resolves the conflict perfectly without cost or complication, lacking the necessary friction to generate narrative drive. The closure is technically a change, but it feels inevitable and devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid, utilizing a single scene with a clear backstory anchor to drive a shift in perspective. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the seal becomes a key to a new philosophy—lands effectively. However, the resolution relies heavily on expository dialogue to explain the mystery rather than active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: preparation, execution, and success without complication or meaningful deviation. The closure—while technically present as a completed task—lacks weight because the outcome is never in doubt; the "cost" is described cosmetically (tears) rather than felt through a difficult trade-off or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a ritual with a predictable outcome; the "magic fix" resolution bypasses causal complexity. While the closure (leaving the relics) is legible, it lacks a felt cost in the present moment, as the sacrifice is symbolic and pre-planned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a linear sequence of instructions from a magical object, lacking protagonist-driven turns or genuine complications. The intrusion of meta-commentary ("This was the first thread of progressive disclosure") shatters the narrative frame and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story is a linear vignette that lacks a causal turn or meaningful obstacle; the protagonist observes, envisions, and acts without facing resistance. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" where the resolution is granted by a vision rather than earned through a high-cost decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear vignette lacking causal pressure; events happen sequentially without necessary linkage (mending -> tea -> whistle). The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the ending merely affirms the beginning's peace, offering no decisive change or cost. The reliance on the fireflies' magical reorganization dissolves tension rather than resolving it through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Closure lands with a clear decision, but the inciting discovery strains credibility: reassembling "hundreds" of shredded paper fragments on a stone in a radiation suit implies a time scale of days, not a single scene. This time-dilation artifact breaks the scene's logical continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.6)
    The climax relies entirely on a deus ex machina ("a miracle occurred—the ionosphere cleared") rather than protagonist agency, which fatally undermines causal tension. The resolution dissolves into broad summary ("News spread like gentle tide") rather than a grounded, dramatized closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation structure, but the causality is weak; the protagonist cleans a gear, captures a sound, and feels peace without facing any obstacle or cost. While the orientation is clear, the closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the resolution is granted rather than earned through a decisive, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clean Causal arc with a clear inciting incident and technical resolution. While the closure is legible (the Chime is fixed), the "earned stasis" feels relatively low-cost, restoring the status quo without a significant irreversible price or sacrifice beyond temporary exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear process where external factors (rain) assist rather than complicate the goal, resulting in a low-friction "just so" progression. While orientation and causality are clear, the lack of a significant reversal or tightening complication flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a *deus ex machina*—the lantern providing a psychic download of the murder—to resolve the central mystery, effectively breaking the promise of a procedural investigation. While the scene has a beginning, middle, and end, the causality is weak because the protagonist receives the answer passively rather than extracting it against resistance. Closure lands on a resolve, but the lack of earned discovery dilutes the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central physical conflict is resolved by a *Deus ex machina*—a shaft of light fortuitously revealing the invisible fracture—rather than professional competence or agency. This coincidence undercuts the narrative logic and satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "months bled" transition elides the actual conflict (the "spectacular failures"), rendering the narrative arc structurally flat. Closure lands as a success without the required felt or conceptual cost, reading as a victory lap rather than a resolution of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear decisive change at closure, but the causality hinges on a convenient exposition dump via video log rather than active deduction. The discovery moment ("Then she saw it") is a coincidence that resolves the investigation too easily, bypassing the need for a more earned breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of success with no causal friction or setbacks. The resolution ("The courageous anomaly had succeeded") is a textbook example of "symmetric satisfaction," where the problem is solved completely and instantly by magic without a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that carries a visible price. The logic of using gift shop mirrors to fix a crystal ball relies entirely on stated authorial fiat rather than established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on the "magic object" trope—finding a specifically relevant journal floating in the ocean—to resolve the central conflict. While the closure (accepting the appointment) is legible, it feels unearned because the protagonist does not drive the revelation; she merely receives it through a high-probability coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" where deep relational strife evaporates instantly after a single speech, lacking causal rigor. The resolution is unearned and symmetric, treating the conflict as a puzzle solved by a metaphor rather than a lived struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (preparation, action, success) without a decisive turn or meaningful complication. The closure brings success without a visible or felt cost beyond minor physical fatigue ("joints aching"), resulting in a low-tension arc that lacks a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure relies on a summary montage spanning weeks rather than a cohesive scene with rising action. Closure is achieved through a "mission accomplished" tableau where the problem is fully solved without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist or community. The ending feels unearned because the obstacles (decades of pain) vanish instantly upon contact with the method.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path without meaningful tightening or causal reversals; the climax (placing the crystal) feels predetermined rather than earned by overcoming resistance. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing of "growth," the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel like a granted epiphany rather than a hard-won insight. Orientation is clear, but the drive is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative structure, using the ritual of placing markers to build density toward the climactic manifestation. Closure is effective, landing on Earned Stasis where the protagonist accepts the cycle of loss and renewal with visible resolve. The logic of the magic system holds together well, though the transition from the final marker to the manifestation feels slightly swift and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible (clock fixed, phenomenon captured), satisfying the Causal lens. However, the causal mechanism—an earthquake winding a spring to "screaming tension" that is fixed by a "soft" touch—operates on poetic rather than physical logic, making the resolution feel slightly convenient and reducing the weight of the obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks genuine causality or cost; the resolution is a "soft reset" where grief is smoothed over instantly by the song and scent without a trade-off. The ending feels unearned, relying on a magical fix rather than a decision that carries weight or consequence. There is no "Decisively Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that feels paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is solid, establishing the anomaly and the method of solution clearly. The narrative moves logically from hypothesis to execution to closure, though the linear progression lacks a significant deepening or twist in the middle to challenge the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The climactic realization rests on a significant logical gap: checking a three-year-old tooth for imperfections does not casually disprove that a *current* body is a changeling or that a swap occurred recently. This leap undermines the story’s central epiphany, confusing the timeline and the nature of the proof.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance with no causal setbacks or meaningful cost; Elara intends to craft the light and succeeds without obstacle. Closure offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a reconfiguration of stakes or options.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story functions as a coherent linear vignette with clear closure (burying the pendant). However, the progression lacks causal friction or obstacles; the protagonist moves from entry to resolution without facing significant complications.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    The structure follows a linear Accumulative lens (observing a sequence of visions), but lacks causal progression or rising stakes between the beats. The ending offers a soft resolution (finding peace) without a decisive change or paid cost; the "boundary blurring" is a convenient device rather than a structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path where the protagonist succeeds exactly as planned without obstacle or deviation. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—total restoration with no unforeseen consequence—lacking the requisite cost or decisive change to create a resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic structure provides a clear beginning, middle, and end. The closure is earned through the established magic system, though the lack of unforeseen complications makes the trajectory feel somewhat inevitable and linear.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—observe, diagnose, repair—that leads to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending without a Decisive Change or felt cost. The resolution ("echoes were safe") feels like a "mission accomplished" checklist rather than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear "process" arc (encounter burden, apply technique, succeed). Closure is legible as a completed task with a moment of earned stasis. While structurally sound, the story lacks a sharp causal twist or a deepening that radically recontextualizes the premise; it executes the prompt efficiently but safely.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure functions as a coherent vignette, anchoring the ritual clearly. However, the narrative lacks strong causal drive or tension; the progression feels inevitable and linear, moving from reflection to success without a decisive turn or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent but strictly linear; the inciting incident leads directly to resolution without complication or deviation. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing, but the lack of causal obstacles turns the plot into a procession rather than a dramatic struggle, reducing the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear process without a decisive change in values or a felt cost; the resolution is achieved through "adventure game logic" (using a sextant housing to aim water) that lacks causal credibility. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration of the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on a "miracle" coincidence—the crystal resonating the exact unwritten note—to resolve the central conflict, which undercuts the protagonist's agency. While the closure (reframing her work) is technically present as a Conceptual Repricing, the path there is paved with convenience rather than causal consequence. The cost is stated ("bear it fully") rather than dramatized through difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot hinges on a weak causal pivot: the protagonist suddenly noticing coordinates she had previously dismissed, merely because the story required a resolution. A significant portion of the word count is devoted to summarizing past betrayals (the expedition, Thorne) rather than dramatizing the present moment. The closure is a mental reset without a concrete, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest with no reversals or meaningful obstacles; closure creates a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist gains both the object and the wisdom without paying a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with low resistance; the "mystery" is resolved instantly through a convenient psychic vision ("fingers knew this thread") and immediate confirmation by the gardener. While the orientation and sequence are clear, the plot lacks causality—things happen because the theme requires them, not because the protagonist makes difficult choices. Closure is a thematic summary rather than a dramatized change.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a resonant closure where the protagonist's goal is reframed. The "flawed genesis" twist serves as a strong Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, effectively integrating the setting's limitations into the plot's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a ritual with clear sequencing but low causality and negligible pressure. Closure is achieved through a symbolic act (burying the coin) that feels like "Earned Stasis," but the lack of resistance or meaningful tightening makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a mechanical "video game" logic where fetching three items linearly unlocks the prize, lacking genuine causal pressure or complication. The temporal logic is incoherent; geese pause mid-flight (suggesting a time stop) while the moon moves across the sky (suggesting time passing), creating a disorientation that is never resolved. Closure is achieved through a coincidental alignment rather than a decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear vignette of a successful task with no decisive change or complication; the "razor's edge" stakes are stated but not dramatized. The ending offers a realization that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no actual resistance or cost during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative arc relies on a deus ex machina (Lyra) to resolve the central creative conflict, bypassing the protagonist's internal struggle. While the structure is coherent, the resolution lacks an earned cost or decisive change initiated by Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative structure is a straightforward procedural (problem identified, task performed, success achieved) with no significant reversals or complications. While the ending provides thematic closure, it lacks a "felt cost" or decisive change in the status quo, reading more like a completed checklist than a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative lacks causal pressure; the mystery is resolved through magical exposition (voices in threads) rather than protagonist agency or deduction. The closure is a low-stakes realization provided by an external source, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a linear path to a "Charged Poise" ending ("She was ready"), but the closure lacks a legible cost; the resolution of the central doubt is a "soft reset" that clears the obstacle without sacrifice. The orientation and causal chain are clear, but the narrative arc is flat because the protagonist faces no significant friction that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, gathering atmosphere and lyrics to build toward a decisive conceptual repricing at the closure. The plot is minimal—tuning, transcribing, a brief scare, and a realization—but the closure unit (redefining the dust as an audience) lands effectively. The interference beat is a functional micro-turn, though it resolves somewhat conveniently without altering the outcome or exacting a tangible price beyond fleeting fear.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure that achieves closure through a conceptual realization, but the progression lacks causal friction or unexpected turns. The ending relies on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming obstacles, reading more like a procedure than a plot.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient, moving from a clear inciting incident (finding the tablet) to a decisive act of concealment. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the burden of silence. The structure works well as a vignette, though the stakes regarding the Council remain abstract and off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure relies heavily on a "weeks passed" montage to resolve the central conflict, bypassing the necessary causal steps of the reconciliation. While the final scene offers a closure moment (the apple/grafting exchange), the cost is low because the hard work of "unlearning hatred" happens off-page in summary, reducing the narrative drive to a gentle glide.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a low-resistance linear path where obstacles (ruins, vines) are overcome instantly by magic ("synaptic plasticity") and coincidence (alignment). The ending offers a "mission accomplished" resolution without a felt cost or a twist that recontextualizes the effort.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal logic holds, but the resolution relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern where the engineer instantly decodes and accepts a poetic riddle without friction. The closure is tidy and lacks a felt cost, as the transition from failure to philosophy happens too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent but linear, following a simple "observation → ritual → epiphany" structure without complication. The causality relies on a convenient, almost magical shift ("Instantly, a profound hush descended") that feels unearned by the preceding realistic setup. The closure is legible as a conceptual shift, but the lack of friction makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on a mechanical sequence of "revelations" triggered by a magical object, lacking genuine causality or earned turns. There is no resistance; the protagonist enacts a solution that instantly resolves the city's history and trauma without visible cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear climb-rupture-resolution arc. The closure (Earned Stasis) is valid and legible; Elara's decision to stay and absorb the texture rather than escape provides a definitive end to the cycle's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist's desire is immediately and conveniently gratified by a stranger's perfect reaction. The closure relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—the nurse does exactly what Elara hopes for—which removes tension rather than resolving it with cost. The use of a "discreet distance" to witness the payoff is a convenient device that shortcuts the ambiguity of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution relies on a convenient epiphany where the outsider protagonist interprets a local carving better than the indigenous elders, breaking credibility. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem vanishes instantly without cost or complication, and the "necessary thaw" is explained to the reader rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on a convenient backstory discovery (the yoyo found "weeks prior") to solve the central problem, sapping present-tense tension. The climax hinges on an implausible optical effect (light rearranging letters) that reads as magical realism without sufficient setup, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "logic bomb" resolution where a spoken paradox defeats the antagonist without struggle. The closure is a net gain (curse healed) with no visible or felt cost, reducing the climax to a mechanical transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, with legible orientation and a clear sequence of events. However, the resolution relies on a "magic works perfectly" trope where the ritual solves the external threat without extracting a significant tangible or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with a "lock and key" structure that lacks causal tension on the page. The resolution relies on a convenient external factor ("celestial alignment") and a pre-prepared tool, removing the need for adaptation or sacrifice. Closure is achieved, but without a felt cost or a "decisive change" generated by the scene’s pressure; it feels like a victory lap rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette rather than a causal arc; the inciting incident (a falling petal) is arbitrary and generates no pressure. Closure is achieved through assertion of relief rather than a earned shift in stakes or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure without a meaningful causal turn or deepening. The closure provides a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist simply finishes his intended ritual and leaves, lacking a Resonant Reconfiguration or felt cost beyond wet boots. The orientation is clear, but the plot lacks dramatic propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal chain from investigation to discovery and action, achieving a legible Decisive Change at the closure. However, the sequence lacks tension or obstacles; the protagonist encounters no setbacks, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. Orientation is stable, but the lack of complications flattens the structural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (polish, record, fold) with no meaningful friction or risk of failure. The "descent" is a thematic parallel rather than a causal complication, leading to a predictable resolution. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, it feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The single-scene structure is solid, utilizing the cooling circuit breakers effectively as a ticking clock to impose urgency. However, the causal mechanism—a mental "nudge" altering physical reality—relies on convenience, and the closure is a standard resonant reconfiguration that feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the goal is achieved immediately upon arrival without setbacks or complications. The closure fails the cost requirement; the protagonist gains both the magical objective and the romantic connection without paying a visible price or making a difficult trade-off. The ending relies on a "have your cake and eat it too" resolution that dissolves the central conflict instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on a shattering coincidence: finding a driftwood carving that perfectly replicates a specific watch hand from a past deception. This contrivance breaks causality and suspension of disbelief, functioning as a deus ex machina to force the resolution. The narrative scaffolding ("His method was...", "The core concept... was...") disrupts the causal flow with exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, ceremonial structure with clear orientation and closure, but it lacks a causal turn or significant obstacle within the scene itself. The plot is essentially the execution of a protocol established before the story began, resulting in a smooth but low-stakes progression that feels more like a vignette than a fully driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story structure is solid, with a distinct inciting incident and a clear, causally driven turning point where the physical constraint (poles ending) forces a decision. The inciting incident and climax are well-defined. The resolution is logically sound under the Causal lens, though the "peace" achieved feels slightly rushed and symmetric.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a functional quest structure, but the middle section compresses the investigation into a low-tension montage of solved riddles. The climax relies on a magical external reaction (bioluminescence surging) to resolve an internal psychological problem, bypassing the necessary causal friction of a hard decision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual progression with clear orientation and a legible Decisive Change (transformation into trees) at closure. However, the plot lacks causal complications or reversals; the ritual proceeds without error or unforeseen obstacles, making the outcome feel like a foregone conclusion. The "seven nights" and "phoenix" setup provides background texture but does not causally pressure the present-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a soft-reset epiphany that resolves the conflict without causal pressure or obstruction. Closure is achieved through a realization that "melts" the problem away, lacking the structural rigor or felt cost required for a high-band Situational or Causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and procedural, resembling a ritual checklist rather than a plot driven by genuine pressure or uncertainty. Causality relies on heavy exposition of rules ("ancient texts also spoke") rather than organic discovery, and the resolution comes without significant on-page obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The resolution relies on a coincidental prophecy unknown to the protagonist, which renders the climax accidental rather than earned by agency. The mid-scene pivot to a secondary POV (Mano) acts as an expository patch to explain the volcano's calming, lowering narrative tension and causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and complete, moving efficiently from the inciting blackout to the successful signal. Causality is solid, though the protagonist's path is linear and lacks complications or reversals. The closure (a decisive change with the network awakening) lands effectively, providing a clear before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear objective and a resonant closure (restoration of friction). The inciting incident is routine maintenance, and the central obstacle (the curse's vision) is resolved somewhat easily via "breath and purpose," lowering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is functional and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands, but the inciting incident relies on the convenient discovery of the letter rather than active pursuit. The causality is linear and soft; the transition from vigil to action is driven by a prop's message rather than internal pressure forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear puzzle-solution sequence that lacks a decisive turn or genuine cost; the protagonist succeeds without sacrifice. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—total success and peace—violating the requirement for a closure unit with felt or conceptual cost. The "capricious breeze" is introduced as chaos but integrated instantly, failing to function as a true complication.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative arc is linear and predictable, relying on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the central problem is solved by a secondary character's speech. There is no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the "molt" happens smoothly after a pep talk, rendering the stakes negligible. The closure feels unearned because the protagonist sacrifices nothing to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear setup and a distinct closure unit (the clock moving forward). The transition from reality to the arbor is handled smoothly, and the ending delivers a tangible "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the initial problem. Causality is largely magical/dream-logic, which works for the genre, though the "research" exposition dump slows the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "task-success" structure where the prescribed method works without complication or reversal. Closure is achieved through a "net gain" resolution (memory saved, role expanded) that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost to give the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no meaningful tightening or reversal; the protagonist simply executes a ritual to solve the problem. The ending is a "soft reset" where the magical tool removes the cost ("diffuse its sting") rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: daily observations densify to CR closure—"the lightness of belonging"—with legible cost in forfeited control ("frantic need to control meaning"); orientation anchored early, no shards violate scope.

    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reservoir dissolves, her breath re-weights the premise—unused love is potential, not debt—conceptual cost is unmistakable in the final image (“breath a quiet prayer”). Pattern is taught early (each exhale alters the obscura image), held to last line. One soft spot: the sailor memory is floated twice but never re-prices the present action, so the causality hinge is slightly loose.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photographs stabilize, time becomes habitable, and the cost is the irrevocable loss of the fragment and of Aris’s last frozen touch. Hyperbolic geometry is seeded early (“recursive folds,” “whispers traveling hours”), paid off when the halo unspools along geodesics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; pattern taught by 25 % and reweights the stake at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: decoding the keys → opens panel → halts bulldozer; each step tightens options under a situational lens. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—destruction impeded by shared awe, foreclosing the wall’s demolition with conceptual cost (the foreman’s vow). Orientation is anchored by word 26; no penalty. The only drag is a single causality leap: the crew’s instantaneous, uniform reverence feels convenient, trimming the score from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she reframes memory as compass—yet the cost is purely asserted (“tear dissolved,” no stakes forfeited). Causal chain is missing: forge’s glow, coil warmth, and reframing appear without prior setup of rules or consequence for misuse. Orientation is clear by ~120 wds; however, the lens shifts from accumulative (collecting absences) to situational (ritual acceptance) without teaching the shift, softening final legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thorns-into-forest choice reconfigures her life narrative with felt opportunity-cost (the midnight train leaves without her). Causal lens holds throughout—because she uncorks the jar, therefore the arrow appears, therefore she alters the bouquet and her path. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 120 words; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening: “Abandon this path” → “Follow the thorns to find your light” narrows options and crystallizes stance. Persistent constraint—the emptied jar—shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early via drip-drip motif and torch rhythm; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—flawed bookmark under dome reweights “broken = more light.” One shard, no teleporting props; hairline fracture is taught causal trigger. Cost is visible: scrapped vessel + bookmark repositioning. Orientation anchored by word 40.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: DNA betrayal → flight → shell discovery → decryption → decoy → rooftop escape; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell’s whisper is repurposed, Silas is lured away, and Elara’s phobia is not cured but re-instrumented—cost is felt in the trembling ascent and the tears that “fell freely.” Orientation is anchored by word 48; no lens ambiguity. One minor elasticity: the quarry river is introduced only during the etching beat, yet the tactic succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence-images intensifies until the lone-star fade reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the small circle stroke crystallizes storm-calm cycle, cost felt in the pale star and sealed night. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“storm-tossed ridge fort”). No causality break; booklet flakes and stylus shards track consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin dissolves, time unloops, and the janitor re-weights janitorial labor as sacred participation—cost is the forfeiture of certainty that thought has a single locus. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each loop adds sensory fragments until the violin harmonizes them; the 43-to-1 fold is the decisive intensification. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (frozen courtyard, twilight, seventeen-minute window); no teleporting props or retro-patches appear.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the forecourt becomes a living gallery, mistrust dissolves, and the mirrored key charges the final image with earned cost. Causal chain—lens → projected symbol → Kael’s public recognition—holds without gaps; no teleported information. Orientation is swift; crystals, rain, and registrar anchor by line 6. Accumulation lens dominates; pattern of nightly tickets → single projection → community garden of light tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s thorn-gate crystallizes the cost of Kael’s worldview and reweights Elara’s “mended deception” premise. Causal linkage holds—marble pressed, thorns withdraw, luck meter cracks—yet the garden’s agency is external, so the decisive change feels shared rather than protagonist-driven. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael builds the device in secret and pulls the lever, time branches are revealed, forcing a permanent stance change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise—he forecloses the “straight road” of linear time and accepts sideways breath with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Persistent constraint: tomorrow he still fixes drones, but under reweighted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fermata watermark reweights the premise—acknowledgment, not completion, is enough—felt cost is the shared suspension itself. Causal chain is clean: because the flood composed a phrase, Elias must answer; because he answers, the silence transforms. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Accumulation (water stains → Orion → fermata) tightens once and holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: palm on glass, whispered promise, aurora overhead—cost is felt, path foreclosed. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (drip, needle tremor, smudge bloom) tightens the stake until the final image reweights “truth.” No causality breaks; Kael’s earlier warning seeds the guilt that the smudge forces her to swallow. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eleanor’s call early + the wheel’s glint at midpoint teach the pattern and validate the Causal lens; the final bead-click turns story substance from rumor to filial duty. The decisive change lands—the vow is opened, truth released, Leo reconfigured from doubter to carrier. Cost is audible, tactile, and social: the click both exposes and risks the foreman’s family. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (gravel, rails, junction) are fixed by third sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descent–return pattern deepens silence until “crumbling peace” reweights the stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sapling’s hope reframes decay as evolution with conceptual cost—“permanence” is the thing lost. Orientation is swift; origami swan teaches the burrow rule by line 90. No因果 reversals are required; the final line crystallizes options under the regenerative rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the curl passed back “The link is real” reweights both relic and sky under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold. One meaningful tightening—the eclipse hush compresses attention to the shared object—suffices. Persistent constraint: the curl’s absence from her pocket afterward signals ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers resonance until the closing palm-to-wall Charged Poise reweights the silo from grain store to “harvest of human spirit.” Orientation anchored by word 40; cost is the historian’s own isolation sealed into the case. Closure is on-page, undeniable, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he hides truth in cookies → ferry carries cookie → Elara reads → returns; his final spoken apology is the decisive change that forecloses the old path of secrecy. Closure carries unmistakable cost—he abandons the microdot method and the twenty-year silence, felt in the handshake and the tide’s rhythm shift. Lighthouse and cookie mechanics are taught early and paid off; no teleporting props. Orientation anchor (“after last orders”) is clear by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillness is rewoven not by exorcism but by Elara’s decision to open the palette, a visible, felt cost. The because/therefore causal lens holds—each rhetorical question collapses her false fortress until the final latch-click reweights hope. Anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 5; orientation never wavers. No artifact touches the final image; the hush after pedal-release is the charged poise that forecloses return to monochrome safety.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirrored horizon’s one-second barn vision reweights all prior stakes; Cost is the dizziness wave and the foreclosed option of ever hearing the full symphony again—price paid in body and possibility. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (“map onto the spiral”), each memory placement intensifies density until the crescendo reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 40 words. One meaningful tightening suffices; fatigue clock narrows options. All causal chains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard of labyrinth re-weights memory-stakes until the final fusion. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tablet’s release re-prices the entire rule-set, fusing timelines with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by the first clause’s inversion and paid off when gravity becomes “a gentle companion.” No causality breaks; every re-gen corridor is traceable to tablet-runed emotional data.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken needle reframed from loss to legacy, silence re-priced as fertile ground—cost legible in the final image (“steady rhythm against her ribs”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tactile vibration layers density until the cadence shift (“numbness dissolved”) reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“gravel path to the drum maker’s cavern”); single transition (twilight exit) is legible. No causality break; every beat is a because/therefore of vibration seeking a body.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: she weaponizes the enemy’s tracker bird to ship a steganographic truth, turning surveillance into broadcast. The causality chain (followed → clay probe → lateral counter-use) tightens once and lands with the persistent constraint that tomorrow’s public report must still carry the breadcrumb—an ongoing exposure risk. Orientation (who/where/when) is secured by line 34; the text never violates its taught single-scene window. Cost is legible in the final image: she anchors herself to a life of perpetual, meticulous exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: UV lamps dim, tears still fall, she presses the vial to her heart—an image that reconfigures vocation and grief simultaneously. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light/revelation taught early (“fractured moonlight… crystal shadows”) culminates in ultraviolet cathedral. Causality intact: because she is aromatically cautious, the single drop matters; because the vial was pre-loaded by Gran, inscription glows. Cost is felt—no forced reset—earns 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rope bridge left hanging reconfigures both quest and ethic without a step being taken, and the cost—abandoning first-hand knowledge of the fissure—is felt in the final image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each layer of sensation deepens the stake until the refusal itself becomes the decisive intensification. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens until the flattened, humid note reweights the stake from “breaking silence” to “co-existing with it.” Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sunken orchard greenhouse”) and never drifts; transitions are fluid. Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse now “pregnant with possibility,” the bowl’s final tremor a visible, felt cost. No causality breaks; every image (shipwreck ribs, rusted bones) echoes back to the bowl’s vibration, tightening the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative lens: each amber-to-violet light shift and static hum thickens the texture until the accidental grief ruptures the pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s subsume act crystallizes options with felt cost (“he lived it”). Persistent constraint: the spent petal left on the ledge literalizes the price. No orientation drift; pattern taught by 25 % and lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: mis-addressed envelope → locket reveal → recognition → anonymous note plan; each beat narrows options under a single lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walks toward the harbor carrying the “first ripple,” a conceptual cost that reweights his transactional worldview. Persistent constraint—his newly chosen “logistics of the soul”—shapes the final image. One micro-turn (Liam’s arrival) complicates without resolving; no coincidence solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (reed-stained hands, chimes, arbor against obsidian) deepens the stake of belonging until the dedication reweights solitude into kinship. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the graft has taken root”—with felt cost (permanent reed stain, Kael’s tear). One causal micro-gap: Echo’s tag is found by luck, not tactic, but coincidence merely reveals, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: cadence hitch → pendant trigger → time-thread → key → cage opens → giant wakes. The Silent Pause functions as taught temporal key; cost arrives in exhausted pendant and irreversible nap-end. Orientation anchored by word 26; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final *plink* reconfigures meaning with undeniable emotional cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean—glass-eye placement → vision → insight → acceptance—taught within the first 120 words and held to the resonant last line.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single-scene causality is clean: outage → access → cache → dawn reveal; each beat tightens the next under a causal lens. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s full emergence reconfigures both women’s futures with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no debt. The sparrow-filed edge of the reel persists as a constraint that shapes placement and recognition, satisfying the persistent-price test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of storm aftermath → observation → surrender deepens once, then reweights via new growth imagery. Closure lands as Charged Poise—leaf bookmarked, no repair planned—cost is the forfeited certainty of control. Orientation anchored within 120 words; causality intact (storm damage → altered stance → altered nursery practice). No meaningful slips near the image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a CR: handing over the brooch reweights the premise—memory is a current, guardianship temporary. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; rain-trail imagery and tide rhythm tighten until the final sleep invitation feels inevitable. Cost is visible in the physical surrender of the amber and the instantaneous exhaustion that follows. One transition (tower→ravine→tower) is clean, taught by the pilgrim impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s “surrender to the present” reweights her gift from prediction to presence, with the pearl’s warm pulse as tangible cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory intensification is a because/therefore of intention focused through overlapping shadows. Orientation is locked by word 80; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props. The only micro-slip: the scrolls’ warning is told once and never tested, so the river-of-consciousness price remains abstract, not persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ivory stones now bear “returning feet and new stories,” a legible before/after reweighting with visible communal cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment-display tightens the tapestry, cadence shifts at sunset trumpet note, then again at child’s drawing promise. Orientation anchored within 120 words; transitions across seven shards are legible via recurrent trumpet/image pattern. No causality break; persistent constraint—her involuntary visionary pain—shapes every tactic and final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly via a Conceptual Repricing: the punched circle reframes her life-map as a lens, undeniable cost felt in the tear-baptism. Causal linkage holds: surrender of maps → punch → mist-parting revelation accumulates under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 30, well within waiver. Minor over-narration of epiphany keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “He’s part of this journey… not gone… just traveling” crystallizes both Liam’s stance and the tower’s reconfigured meaning; Elara’s promise to “honor every visitor” shows the persistent constraint. The causal chain—tile → alignment → entanglement → transcription → solace—holds without gaps; the meridian line and journal diagrams pay off the early set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is cleanly a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library of farewells reweights goodbye from void to remembrance, image charged (“tears…washing away dust”). Causal lens holds: the solar storm → magnetic awakening → tear → fragment guidance → repository → release. Orientation anchor is lush and early. Cost is conceptual but undeniable; the escondite’s palette literally warms, a visible difference. Deduction for teleporting the fragment’s rule: magnetic trigger is declared only at the moment it solves the plot, not seeded earlier to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the asylum equation reweights “fair” from subtraction to integration, with visible cost—she must protect former victims while risking retaliation. Causal lens holds throughout: ink pot → softens dilemma → proposal → breach. Orientation anchored by word 25; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint (threat from father’s circle) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lamp’s surrender at 5:41 AM crystallizes her ritual and reweights the stake—today’s texture is archived, tomorrow’s is already slipping away. Causality is accumulative/textural: each dawn chart thickens the pad’s ghosts, tightening the cost of continuity without external antagonist. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation (silent town, bonsai labyrinth) is taught early and repaid when gilded branches ignite at the end. Persistent constraint is legible: the hum is finite, the town irretrievable, the gold leaf irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density until the poison label reweights the stake, crystallizing the keeper’s purpose. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tide’s return and the foghorn reconfigure meaning without dissolving tension. Cost is legible in the final line: “ready to collect the next whisper” forecloses any future claim to identity. Orientation is taught by word 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass is revealed to be the act of remembrance itself, and the price is the surrender of her lifelong myth-busting identity (“truth must be permanent”). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each cello hum layers density until meaning reweights. The painted shell’s warming is a taught pattern that pays off in the final image. Cost is unmistakable in the phrase “some truths are too tender for debunking,” foreclosing her former methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the network is live, OmniCorp still coming, but community voice is now irreversible—cost felt in the dawn stakes. Causal chain intact: each mural choice → network growth → shared resolve. One transition (dusk to dawn) is clean; orientation anchored by 80 words. No plot amnesia; graffiti code stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The single-scene arc lands a clean Charged Poise: sunrise triggers the chemical shutter, the crater’s fate is sealed, Kael’s vigil forecloses to a last descent—cost is legible in the final line “carrying the last light.” Orientation is anchored by word 80; causal chain (capsule → sun → current → photo) holds; no amnesia or teleporting props. Closure reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unbroken river of light in the basin confirms success and re-weights Elara’s covenant with hope; cost is the departing drone itself, now beyond her reach. The water-diagnosis rule is taught early, used in midpoint escalation, and repaid in the final image—no retroactive fixes. Causal chain (fracture → water test → patch → re-test → release) is intact under a single continuous scene; depot bell and hummingbird hum provide external clocks that keep orientation secure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—condensation, phrasebook, falcon flight—and lands a Charged Poise closure: “some truths require only stillness to be heralded” (252). Causality is interior but legible: each pattern increment (frost, phrase, bird-log) tightens the convergence until stance crystallizes. Cost is palpable: professional identity abandoned, cold dawn vigil assumed. No orientation debt; anchoring occurs by word 27 (“rusted outpost’s splintered floorboards”) and re-anchors at each shard break.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s heartbeat restored, Elara’s footsteps silenced—cost is her erasure as agent. Accumulative lens holds: each footstep adds density until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Dissonance snap is on-page, felt in bones; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: Aris’s death is the price for sealing the memory, the vial’s warm glow the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—every thread unsnarled is a because/therefore under oxygen debt. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. The final image reconfigures the distress beacon from self-rescue to memory-homing signal.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam copper-washes the lattice and the two men share an undeniable conceptual cost—“God forgive us”—that reweights every prior scuff. Causal chain holds: lattice acts as aperture because Kael’s salvaging was reported earlier; Elias’s belief is forced by literal eyewitness, not convenience. Orientation anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “the hush Kael chased settled” is a touch expository, but it lands inside the final image and does not blunt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms, Elias lives, and she dissolves—cost is the total erasure of her form. Causal chain (bead → resonance → bloom → cure) is lucid under Accumulative/Textural lens. One shard, no orientation debt; the deepening cadence at “wave of light cascaded” reweights stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stitched overlap layers dream-memory into tangible path, climaxing in the resilient orchid tied off with silver thread—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly memorializes loss while opening future access; causality is lyric, not consequential, but closure still carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return (roots, shadow, blossom) thickens stakes until the noon alignment crystallizes the reconfiguration. Closure is present—the sundial’s living shadow visibly stitches exile to ancestry—cost legible in the tear and the vow to tend. Minor waver: orientation of orchard-to-tomb spatial relation could be anchored one beat sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wax-sealed letter and chalk-dust shoes re-weight the premise with felt cost. Causal chain is intact—code prompts renaming prompts mailing—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 84; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint (surface-mail slowness) shapes the final ritual. One causal micro-turn suffices at this length; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: Vega misplacement → thread divination → corrected chart → covert delivery, each because/therefore link tightens options. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost—fleet rerouted, Elara erased. All anchors locked by word 28; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: her anonymity must hold or she dies—shapes every post-discovery move.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonlit shard becomes a charged talisman that re-weights the past without rewriting it. Cost is legible in the sob that tears loose and the vanished weight in the final paragraph. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is either because of Kael’s regret or therefore changes his interior options. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught within the first 60 words and never loosens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the coral placed beside the cast reweights all prior smudges into “wounds can hold beauty,” with undeniable conceptual cost—she can no longer treat her own scars as dead tissue. Causality holds: because she decrypts Leo’s dread, she can finally voice the answer she once withheld from the Tok Pisin boy, retroactively healing that memory. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each deciphered mark thickens emotional density until the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sterile, mist-clad atrium”), well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the projected fresco completes and the fragment is fixed in wall and heart, reweighting both memory and future art. Causality is lyric-accumulative (fog = film) rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is felt in the crystalline moment of integration, not a physical loss, satisfying the CR test.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural’s newly audible melody reweights her vocation under the Accumulative/Textural lens—density of sound-as-image crests into the final “Listen with curiosity.” The nickel’s acoustic prism is the taught constraint that shapes every subsequent tactic; its cooling after the beam is the felt price. Causality is lyric but coherent: because she waits in the pause, therefore the droplet focuses sound, therefore she sees the staff-line hills. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Sound Wave Garden”) and never loosens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the impossible cicada chorus reconfigures surveillance-night into solidarity with undeniable cost (“dawn would bring risk”). Causal chain holds—seed → rattle → simultaneous activation—tight under 800 words. Orientation is swift; no prop or motive break. A hairline slip: Petrova’s tear mention edges toward label, but it doesn’t dent the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each lullaby deposits sediment that eventually literalizes as living constellations inside the shell, creating a visible before/after. The decisive change is the moment the printed galaxy dissolves into the nacre-wall light—an earned stasis that costs him the fantasy of escape and reweights his vigil as collaborative rather than solitary. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the 20 % backstory block is the sole stretch that slightly slackens momentum, but it is immediately followed by the present ritual beat that tightens again.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked tube’s altered song re-weights every prior echo, leaving the library’s silence newly inhabited. Causal chain (lens → dawn → fracture → duet → orchid ignition) is clean, with “foxglove regret” the persistent price that shapes tactics. Light shift at the end visibly forecloses the ritual, crystallizing meaning without exposition. The Orient test is met at line 5; spatial anchors hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: misinterpretation → silence → vow → illuminated translation → shared dawn presentation; each promise traced literally lights the next glyph, a clean because/therefore engine. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the single luminous sentence reweights the archive’s entire rule-set and their relationship, with felt cost in Elara’s tremoring hand and Kael’s softened shoulders. Orientation is swift—archive, pre-dawn, codex—by line three. No meaningful escalation reversal after the triad paradox, but the tightening coil of dawn suffices as a causal deadline. The glow transfers from page to their joined hands, making the constraint persistent; closure lands with cost and coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure lands as declarative harmony rather than charged poise: we are told the mountain and community “breathed with” each other, but the final image gives no new constraint or price. Causal chain is smooth—decoding adhesive → placing vents → steam released—but the decisive change is off-loaded onto secondary characters (Elara & Borin reconcile) while Kael simply walks away. Surveyor-chain bequest is set up yet carries no tangible cost or limitation in the final beat; the story ends in consensus comfort rather than reconfigured options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger entry “I trusted her. I trust her still” crystallizes a new stance with unmistakable social/psychic cost—his cover is gone. Causal linkage holds: dust pattern → memory flood → renunciation of lie → public confession. Orientation is anchored by word 90; no lens ambiguity. The single skylight beat teaches the accumulative pattern early and lands it at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “thresholds feel sacred precisely because of the necessary distances” reweights the logbook and maze legacy with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (weather code → diversion → maze → absence → insight) holds; orientation is swift; the single reflective block is anchored to bench-touch and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: releasing the feather reconfigures belonging from search to practice with undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light-in-dark images crescendos in sunrise/firefly overlay. Orientation anchored by word 50; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint—crack in dome—shapes final ascent and release.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s pulse and the finch’s early return reweight the premise—paths vanish from completion, not loss—imposing irreversible acceptance on Elara. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed → glass → dissolution tightens meaning through cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity; cost is legible in “tears streamed…smile was genuine.”

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop’s departure crystallizes both men’s altered stance under Vega-lit stone; cost is palpable in Corbin’s relinquished tool and the stranger’s lighter gait. Causal lens holds throughout—tidal peak × star angle → flash → emotional fracture/repair—no coincidence resolves the core want. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“damp stone bench”), well inside the 120-word grace. One meaningful tightening occurs when the reflected shard compels the man to kneel, narrowing options from passive grief to engaged curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard layers sensory density until the final “obsidian grace” reweights exile from burden to chosen flight. The moonstone-dew fusion is the decisive change; starlight sinks into skin, foreclosing Elara’s retreat and charging Kael’s departure with cosmic cost. Orientation is taught early via twilight garden & tide-dancer title; pattern holds without causal gaps. Closure is on-page, felt, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: stone-toss → expanding rings → prism ignition → covenant. Closure is a Charged Poise: options re-weighted (“every fitted pane an act of communion”) with felt cost of perpetual vigilance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One tightening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the porcelain and scars thickens pattern until the final re-pricing (“the crack was not a flaw, but a story”). Orientation anchored by 28 words; no teleporting props; celestial clock tracks silently but inexorably. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bargain’s meaning flips from “preserve” to “witness,” with persistent social cost—he must now speak the language of scars publicly. Cost is legible in the final image: shadow cast “long ahead” signals irreversible path.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the gauge’s new calibration makes the before/after of hope’s altitude legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; the pattern teaches itself early and holds. No orientation debt; grotto, tide, and POV are anchored by line 28.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed cloth-lined case and whispered promise reconfigure her prior curiosity into lifelong guardianship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each artifact layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is secured by word 50 (“ivy-veiled passage”), well inside the 120-word allowance, and the soft-stone/ivy rules remain consistent. One hairline slip: “walls dreamed in symphonies” edges toward mixed metaphor, but it does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final golden flare re-weights every prior image with undeniable conceptual cost—possibility is now resident in the terrace, the child wakes smiling, the painter dissolves having paid with his life. Lens is Accumulative; each spectral blossom incrementally re-prices the mirrors until the last image reconfigures the valley. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no penalty. One soft causality: the heartbeat’s final beat is treated as inevitable rather than triggered by a last-ditch choice, but the effect is lyrically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: Kaelen’s signed resignation and departure crystallize a before/after under the Causal lens—because he admits the Vale burning, therefore the treaty can live without his shadow. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 60 words; moonrise gives a live clock. The persistent constraint—“peace must grow without him”—is visible in the final image of him walking away. Cost is unmistakable: surrender of status and narrative identity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the exposed egg reweights every prior crack in the salt map, making the manufactured drought legible as a personal wound. Causal lens holds throughout—because he diverted the river, the map exists; because the map exists, the egg can be placed; because the egg is placed, memory is externalized and the man is hollowed. Cost is visible in the tear and the mask snapping back, foreclosing redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each untangled thread layers density until the sanctuary’s breath-release reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—prismatic sparks hang like promise, social cost undeniable. Orientation is taught by lyric pattern; disorientation serves the final charged poise. Persistent constraint: once threads are liberated, Elara’s exhausted stance forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the dome’s hush thickens, moonlight narrows, and the stick’s meaning shifts from prop to bridge; the final image—“silence was invitation”—repackages the stake and carries conceptual cost (he forfeits performer status). Orientation is clean by line 3; one causal micro-turn (he pockets the stick) lands in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: repeated weaving–pausing cadence builds density until the monarch’s arrival fractures and re-tunes the pattern. Closure lands as Charged Poise—her signal shifts from communication to compassionate anchor, cost felt in the loosening structures. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the moth wing archive origin is elided without setup, a hairline telegraph.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new braid becomes a permanent cipher, and the released names sink back into ice with a “soft hum,” a felt cost that reweights silence into stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fiber crossing adds density until the auroral beam catalyzes the crystalline chorus. Orientation is anchored by word 66 (“In her palm…”) and the pattern is taught early—no disorientation penalty. No causality breaks; even the aurora is foreshadowed by its “silent, swirling” presence in line 1.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the blank directive and rain-lit path reweight all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost—she can never unread the path’s invitation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first sensory compression to the final cadence shift; decay→transcendence→baptism tightens once without causal leakage. Time, place, and agency stay anchored within the opening 120 words; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: tile alignment triggers star-chart reveal, reconfiguring Enlil’s life from isolation to covenant. Causal chain is thin—no intermediate obstacles or failed attempts—so the turn feels pre-ordained rather than risk-laden, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the final image carries conceptual cost (“frugal act now reverence”).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pin reappears whole beside the still-fractured cylinder, reweighting the premise that grace is in the turning, not perfection. Causal chain holds—each remembered sensation dissolves resentment because the box encodes maternal love. The broken pin’s conditional re-entry is foreshadowed by the “shifting reality” rule taught at the archway. Cost is visible: Kael exits lighter, the sanctuary’s silence now “cradle” rather than “void,” a reconfiguration he could not have borne at entry.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant hums, fog parts, bud appears—undeniable before/after with felt cost under Accumulative lens. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words; no orientation debt. Pattern of breathing-to-harmony is taught early and pays off in the charged poise of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the once-blank ledger now bears the cameo’s carving, crystallizing her irreversible initiation into stewardship. Causal chain holds—failed extraction → bathroom epiphany → open offering → memory inscription → ledger change—each beat narrows options. Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (tapestry metaphor) and holds to last line. Orientation clear by line 4; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each gap-research beat tightens options until the spoken fear germinates the vine—Decisive Change with felt cost. Closure lands on-page: stairway blooms, Kael solidifies, Elara’s stance re-orients from seeking to tending. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words. Persistent constraint: the diary’s voids now demand lifelong cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the card reweights memory from pursuit to stewardship, cost is the literal loss of the only tether. Accumulative lens holds—each frayed thread intensifies the stakes of remembering wrongly until surrender is the only density shift left. Causality stays internal but coherent; no orientation debt. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: seal on door → rope re-weave → door vanishes, each step because/therefore. Closure is a clean CR: the “absence” is conceptually repriced as honored memory, amber liquid sinking into stone supplies undeniable cost. Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. The 0.1 gap reflects a lone soft beat: the clock halts without foreshadowed linkage to the rope, a micro-convenience that slightly dulls the final constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush expands, re-tuning the entire cave system and Kael’s role, with visible cost—the stone now “cool and still,” signalling spent agency. Causal chain (stone → fracture nexus → silence wave) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat intensifies sensory density until pattern-break (abrupt quiet) lands. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within 120 words. One hairline slip: lore fragment is summoned rather than foreshadowed, but it does not rupture the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the same shard that imposed silence now refracts silence into communal light, making the “coincidence = intention” premise undeniable. Causal lens holds: because she angled the largest fragment (and paid with lifelong isolation), therefore the valley answers with lanterns. Cost is on the page—“tears traced clean paths”—and the constraint (only one alignment every × years) persists. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. Minor slip: the phrase “thistle-blown hope” is used twice yet never re-seeds literal thistles; still, the image reweights at the lantern constellation, so the effect lands.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the solid fog is redefined from sealing void to resonant canvas, with undeniable social cost—the archive is no longer below but *is* the sky itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: lightning-shadow patterning → inscription → fissure bloom → chorus acceptance, each beat increasing density rather than reversing plot. Orientation is taught early (obsidian balcony, five granite monuments, congealed fog) and anchors hold without drift. The final image—“the whispering had only just begun”—crystallizes options: she is now perpetual bridge, path foreclosed to mere witness.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: sensory density increases until the mosaic pattern breaks into blueprint. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—stone message reweights her vocation—felt cost is the spent rag knot tucked away, future labor now inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is lyric but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: tidal imagery and returning objects (cicada, crab, anemone) tighten the emotional field until Kael’s shell-change becomes inevitable. Orientation anchors (siblings, grotto, night) land within first 60 words; no causality break. Closure is Charged Poise: Elara’s memory-question and Kael’s “old shell was too tight” reconfigure their shared future with undeniable relational cost—no exposition required. Persistent constraint: the tide’s rhythm literally governs when speech becomes possible, shaping both tactics and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: gravity reasserts, doll hums with stored quiet, sprout roots skyward—visible cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within 50 words. Causality intact: inversion hour → release → seed sprout → mantra. No late rule changes; silence texture is foreshadowed, not retro-fitted.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “noise → monitored silence → re-weighted stillness” taught by 15% mark and held to the last line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the perfectly clear vial plus Leo’s steady whisper reconfigure the meaning of quiet forever; cost is the irreversible substitution of grandmother-absence with terrace-silence. No orientation debt; geography and chronology stay anchored across the single continuous scene. Meets 9+ gate: persistent constraint (storm-glass chemistry) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: ruby shard → orchard entry → paint-peel method → mural reveal → stairway → refusal. Each beat because/therefore narrows her options until dawn crystallizes the barrier; the final renunciation reconfigures the quest and lands cost on-page (“ruby flake dissolved”). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the threshold re-solidifies, the door stays shut, and the cost is the permanence of her exile now shared—a resonant reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens. Causality holds: fading threshold → breath-bridge → silver weave → earned stasis. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“ashen charcoal sanctuary”). No reversals, but one decisive deepening satisfies 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene arc: bolt → Heartroot → diamond lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (loss of the tactile anchor). Causal chain holds: volunteer act triggers Convergence, message cue focuses intent, bolt sacrifice seeds future hope. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: glitch texts’ origin never clarified, but pattern taught early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the letter reframes the dynasty from burden to gift, cost encoded in “legacy is release.” The accumulative lens holds—dust patterns act as fossilized beats that tighten meaning until the vellum snap. Causality is sound: because she listens to stillness, therefore she finds the node; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene scope respected.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of program → memory trigger → patterned choreography → puppet release → dawn. Each beat tightens options until only the brass clasp remains; unsnapping it lands Decisive Change with cosmic sigh cost. Orientation anchors by line 4; transitions are smooth, no ellipsis or ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: dust pattern → envelope → button → annotation → stance shift, each because/therefore link legible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: her future is re-framed by the found kindness with felt cost—she now carries guardianship that forecloses her prior self-definition as “product of the system.” Persistent constraint (guardianship duty) shapes the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drive-lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the truth is aloft, enforcers crash the grove, Elara’s refusal to run reconfigures every prior risk into earned stasis. Causal chain holds—key → booth → microfilm → lagoon-as-transmitter—each because/therefore link narrows her options until only capture or broadcast remains. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“auric lagoon’s edge”) and never loosens. Cost is legible in the closing image: flashlights replacing starlight, the line held but the body forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical block thickens atmospheric density until the dew-drop fall crystallizes the hush; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the valley’s stakes. Causality is interior—music → silence → prophecy neutralized—legible and consistent. Orientation is swift: dawn, cabin, valley, grotto all anchored by word 80. No teleporting props or logic breaks. Cost is felt in the final “vested hush” and single falling drop; the piece meets the 9+ quick test for closure with cost under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of leaf → monument → light reweights stakes each cycle. Closure is Charged Poise: final leaf aloft crystallizes her eternal stance with undeniable cost (“serene gratitude” + dissolved moonstone). Orientation anchored by 3rd sentence; no teleporting props. One minor tighten: “moonstone cabochon dust speck” repeated verbatim twice could compress, but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle renounces north, reweighting the entire premise of fixed direction. Accumulative lens holds: leaf-pattern, latch, waterfall mist each return charged. Cost is palpable—she gives up certainty and gains a current. Minor drag: soot-note arrival is slightly teleported; no causal bridge from admiral’s grief to locket clue.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: failure ➔ coin activation ➔ starlight fusion ➔ transmuted guilt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended crucible and lightened name reconfigure meaning with visible conceptual cost—she shelves the vessel as permanent warning. Orientation is immediate; forge and rain-pool anchors arrive by line 4. One soft spot: the midpoint “luminous echoes” beat summarizes Kael’s departure instead of dramatizing a fresh cause.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Cora dissolves into gold motes, laughter integrated, Elara left with the ache—cost legible in the weighted tooth and cleansed gorge. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dissonant harp phrase increases density until the pattern breaks into bright laughter, reweighting the stake. Causality is intact—harp timbre → memory surfacing → spectral brightness → release. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the strap becomes compass, the equation reframes pain into pattern, and the cost—perpetual exile under UV light—is legible in the final walk. Accumulative lens holds: each triggered memory deepens the mercy datum instead of changing external options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“pine needles beneath his back”) so no penalty. One minor causality slack: the nurse-tenderness unlocks without prior narrative presence, but it tightens the Fibonacci pattern immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each canvas adds density until the lens fragment crystallizes as key, tightening the stake from “remember” to “restore.” Closure is a Charged Poise—shard locked into frame, history re-inlaid in the world—cost is the loss of her private relic. Causality holds: because she finds three hidden details, therefore she surrenders the fragment. No orientation debt; skyline market anchored by word 34.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: dust pattern → crack → timed light-death → ghost offer → hidden cavity → vow to find Clara; the final “weightless burden” line crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration with unmistakable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s “breathing” glass reweights eternity from frozen archive to living organism, cost paid by Elara’s emptied bottle and the permanent crack in perfection. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of frost → whisper → rustle → rupture—each beat densifies stakes until the final image crystallizes new options. No teleporting props; bottled whisper is introduced, handled, depleted in view. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 6; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: storm → mirror ritual → shard revelation → Council reversal, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: decades of violent assumption collapse under visible chroniton evidence, cost etched in Valerius’s tears and Elara’s “too late” ache. No teleporting props; velvet’s texture as projection screen is seeded early. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: stolen light → need for tether → chip insertion → song-path command → dawn returned, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Kael’s physical collapse and the permanent “tinkersong wonder” echo in stone make the before/after legible. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“the covenant of rust—a solemn pact…”) is minor and does not touch the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: returning the compass and abandoning the vial visibly foreclose her original goal with conceptual cost—“wonder begins where explanation ends” reweights the whole quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the premise until the lagoon’s reflectionless surface breaks the pattern and forces surrender. The 120-word anchor clears factory/mountain/after-hours; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final gesture; persistent constraint (no artifact, no scent) shapes the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the slide’s ghost-star projection charges the keystone, reweighting “navigation” as memory-plus-craft, not satellites. The turbine-hum anchors an Accumulative/Textural lens—each return of the mechanical heartbeat thickens ancestral time until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who, where, storm-clock) land by line 6; no penalty. Causality intact: GPS failure → invites ancestral return → carving under star-slide → certainty earned. Cost felt: she steps onto a muddy path with no electronic safety net.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the dawn ray triggers the pattern break. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise—the glass reveals its hidden strata, reconfiguring Elara’s understanding and palette, cost felt in the tears she “traces” and the silence she now carries. The postcard clue is planted early and paid off in the exact eastern window fragment, keeping因果 coherent. Only a sliver below 9 because the external world offers no resistance after the glass delivers its gift; the tightening is purely perceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: because Elias decrypts the diary, he is thrust into the retrocognitive trap; therefore he rearranges the stones, altering Anya’s escape and rewriting the historical record. Closure delivers visible cost—tears, gasping return, the diary now “deeper resonance”—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses the old official lie. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no ambiguity at closure. Persistent constraint: the diary-cipher and the trap’s rules shape every tactical push he attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene causal arc: because magic is gone, therefore Elara conceives a craft-based future; the buried bottle is the decisive act with conceptual cost (she relinquishes the wish era). Closure lands clean under Causal lens, cost legible in “silent vow.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the silence flips from loss to germinating soil, reweighting her entire vocation with orchard-bedrock authority. Causal chain holds—wax shaving triggers recovered memory, memory decodes prophecy, prophecy reframes silence—each link tightening options. One minor elasticity: the crimson apple’s mute fall is pure symbol, not causal trigger, but it lands after the decisive reconfiguration so the beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is crisp: egg vanishes → must reopen vortex → entropy-decrease ritual → tactile revelation → covenant sealed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single melting drop tolls spring into being, cost paid by her irrevocable sensory knowledge. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleporting objects or lore dumps. Holds Accumulative/Textural lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each data observation tightens the no-storm probability, therefore narrowing her options until the rope becomes the final fork. Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost—Abbot’s smile confirms institutional risk absorbed. Orientation, transitions, and set-up/payoff on the resin-mended rope are impeccably placed; no causal gaps or teleporting info.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern-glass reflection reframes vulnerability as strength, paying off the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. However, the causal chain is loose—meteor watching does not tighten options, merely deepens mood—so the ending feels inevitable only within its lyric register, not within plot logic. No persistent constraint or price shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant reframes from chain to bridge via the stained-glass reflection beat, and the soft click of the lid supplies audible cost under an accumulative/textural lens; causality is coherent, orientation clean by line 4, and the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael dissolves after embedding the fragment-message, reweighting time-as-texture for Elara and reader. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image adds density until the capsule’s purpose flips. Cost is felt in Kael’s dissolution, but the beat is compressed into one sentence; a hairline slip keeps it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kite snap supplies the single pattern-break that reweights the stake from “observe beauty” to “write beauty.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the journal shut, the kite offered to tide, the feather bookmarking the new stanza—cost is the surrender of the intact kite and the implicit admission that tomorrow’s fragments may refuse her. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard chime and glowing copper map reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—his death becomes the orchard’s new pulse. Accumulative lens holds: each dawn’s wire-wrap deepens pattern until the final illumination. The only drag is the opening beat that withholds the diagnosis detail for a paragraph, slightly delaying orientation without later payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    The footprints-first structure teaches the pattern immediately; each causal step (“she followed,” “the resin hummed,” “basin glowed”) tightens options until the shared revelation forecloses their ideological war. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: home is molecular, not metaphor, and that reweighting carries undeniable conceptual cost—no going back to the Institute’s dogma. Lens—Causal—holds without slippage; no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green thread reweights the submerged-concord motif with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: each bird translation adds density rather than causal turns, and the final image crystallizes the stake without contradiction. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props or logic breaks. The price is felt conceptually, but not dramatized as a forfeiture Kael must bear, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is immaculate under the Accumulative/Textural lens: the waxed leaf re-illuminated through lantern light is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior solitude into anticipation; the cost—abandoning the safety of Rusthaven, reopening wound-memories—is legible in the single sentence “He did not look back.” Causality is tight: “truth is often tinted” cues the tinted-filter method early; the cylinder riddle sets up the final optical reveal; no step feels arbitrary. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Rusthaven, the scrapyard settlement…”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. A hairline slip: the micro-glyphs are described before we see Kael discover them, a minor sequence fuzz that keeps it from 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystalline Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself is re-read as an intentional map left by the grandfather, turning fifteen years of loss into forward navigation. The Lyre glimpse supplies the decisive causal trigger; the sketchbook and compass provide the tangible cost-objects that foreclose the old ritual of passive mourning. Lens is cleanly causal—each beat narrows Elara’s interpretive options until “true north” becomes expedition, not memorial. Persistent constraint: she must remain on the abandoned station every anniversary to harvest further celestial breadcrumbs.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each chess swap tightens sky-sickness relief while ice-spire groans escalate physical danger, narrowing exit options. Orientation is anchored by word 42; no drift. Closure is a Decisive Change—healed sky, transformed lid, forfeited thief-identity—paid for by seven winters of carving and summit oxygen debt. Cost is legible in the final line: “greatest theft was… giving back,” a Conceptual Repricing that re-weights his entire vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the spelled words pattern is taught by 25% and cadence intensifies until the final “remember” reweights the board’s emptiness into choral presence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, skeletal streets, post-crisis now). Closure is a Charged Poise: the living chorus reconfigures the emptiness as fertile ground with undeniable social cost—she must keep walking, silence gone. One transition (street → gallery) is legible; no causal break; cost is the lifelong burden of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (stone, feather, atlas, breeze) adds density until the final image reweights “home.” Orientation is clean—mountain-bookstore, night, sub-basement by line 81. Closure is Charged Poise: the ascending corridor reconfigures option-space; cost is the irreversible shedding of the mercury glass. No causality breaks; feather mechanics are seeded early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael forecloses exile by accepting the lesson he once denied, and the revived village soundscape makes the cost audible. Causal chain holds—each thread he winnows is a because/therefore step toward unlocking the labyrinth. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, where, when). No teleporting props; tapestry cipher is set up early. Persistent constraint: the silver king in his pocket keeps the mistake physically present.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ritual is reopened to polyphony, undeniable conceptual cost—community must now shoulder collective complicity. Causal chain holds: because Elara refracts truth, elders narrow options to inclusive forgiveness; therefore monolithic blame collapses. Lens is Causal, taught by “because/therefore” echoes and held to final image. Cost is legible in Borin’s thickened voice and the spire revealed as blank canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each quilted memory adds density until the cadence shift at the heart-pockmark beat reweights stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: acid still, gears silent, Kael holding reconfigured meaning—cost is the imminent death of the workshop yet internal sanctuary secured. Causality intact: no teleporting props, no convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 30; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene; orientation anchors by line 3. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: placing the shell reweights memory from possession to release, cost felt in “gentler light” fracturing through him. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of mirror → cave pool revalues the stake. No causal gaps; every beat is a deepening image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whispered scent reweights the keepers’ creed from “shout” to “whisper” with conceptual cost—Silas’s forty-year identity is overturned on-page. Causal chain holds: vial → cork → scent → shared vision → status shift. Orientation is anchored by word 84; no penalty. Single shard, single POV, one tightening beat satisfies 600–800 scope. Persistent constraint: the depleted vial now corked again implies future silence, shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden tableau flickers out, leaving the station still broken yet re-homed inside her. Causal chain is tight—each midnight call → fragment assembly → moon-phase constraint → final circuit—so the lens holds. Cost is incontrovertible: the station stays dark, the calls cease, and she carries the weight forward. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“three nights ago”) and never wavers; no teleporting props or retro-patches appear.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: storm → truffle → ritual → possible safety. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses retreat—”this was necessary”—with the glass eye’s warm pressure against her ribs as visible cost. One smooth ascent, no teleporting props; the textbook rumor is set-up, not last-minute patch.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam’s cyclical sweep reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—keeper now bound to carry strangers’ memories. Causal linkage holds: because he decodes gaps, therefore he must archive the Edelweiss, therefore his vigil acquires new weight. Orientation anchored by word 28; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (perpetual witness) shapes final image and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: chip glimmer → coordinates → cave → ants → doorway; each step compresses options and the creek clock tightens. Closure is a Charged Poise: stepping through is unnecessary because the decision itself reconfigures meaning—“the choice to believe” paid for by rising water and mentor memory. Cost is on-page in the cooled, inert chip and the receding storm.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bleeding starlight reweights her rule, with felt cost—“starlight in her veins” carries the mountain’s cold price. Causal chain holds: obsidian warning → climb → fox truce → grotto → insight → return. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One shard, one transition (descent), valid under Track A.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the secret’s shame → fullness reweighting is legible and resonant. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of color and warmth increases until the embers rise. Orientation is clear by word 50; causality remains stable. No persistent constraint or price is left attached to Elara, muting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each past-self shard layers tonal density until the birch line delivers the reweighting (“The grave is not the story”). Orientation is swift; the dream-awake transition is clean and lands a Charged Poise with conceptual cost. One minor lapse: the scroll’s spontaneous inscription skirts physical causality, though the lyric pattern teaches us to accept it.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drip-cadence pattern taught early, reweighted at closure when “quiet click” reconfigures meaning. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: clamp seated, fog lifting, purpose rediscovered with conceptual cost (permanent anosmia). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line four. Persistent constraint—smell loss—shapes every tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the ink hardens under stress, therefore she must release stress via the tear, which rewrites the scars. The 120-word orientation anchor is met—floating rock, dusk, tea master delay—so no penalty. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scars become a living map, foreclosing the old shame. Cost is legible in the glowing palm and the exhaled breath that ends the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reconnection ritual ends with Valerius’s warm acceptance before he dissolves, reweighting Elara’s guilt into quiet certainty; cost is the orchard’s impending loss and the irreversible perfume expenditure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—scent and chord density increase until the orchard hush is replaced by cleansed silence and first axe bite, all on-page. Causality is intact: because she uncorks perfume during the Nocturne, therefore memory congeals and forgiveness lands. Orientation anchors who/where/when within first 110 words; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cumulative/Textural lens: each spiral lap layers a lexical fracture → repair → silence, tightening semantic stakes until the blank "existence" page forces the climactic re-pricing. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the witness becomes speaker, paying with the solitude of sole authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the droplet’s fall reweights “what clocks measure” with irrevocable perceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds because each backward count intensifies sensory density; no props or knowledge teleport. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“granite platform… horizon measurement station”).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative pattern (grief → permeability metaphor → laser pass) tightens once and lands a clean Charged Poise: the silent alarm registers “no threat,” reweighting her emotional rule-set. Causality is lyric, not plot-based, but the pattern is taught early and closure carries undeniable conceptual cost (“grief shift” felt in the tear). Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the invisible door opens under lantern-gold, crystallizing the “lucid contradiction” rule. Causality is soft—tiles shift because light, not because Elara risks anything—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the image reweights earlier motifs but lacks a felt price. Orientation is clean by line 6; one seamless scene-to-subway transition.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the click of the receiver is a resolved chord, not a hang-up, and the disc becomes “compass”—a conceptual repricing that lands with visible cost: she stays, alone, waiting for the next ring. Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is “because/therefore” linked to her method of turning mis-dials into grace. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“scarlet phone booth bolted to the subway utility tunnel wall”). No prop or rule break; the loop is the engine, not a gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gust + salt mist + ink impression visibly reconfigure grief into “seed packet of continuing joy,” cost unmistakable. Method (“proximate causes”) anchors every beat; no teleporting props. Orientation complete by line 4; single shard, one tightening, causal lens held.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: passing the stone crystallizes the new mission and forecloses the old. Causal chain is lean but intact—rumor summons → encounter → renunciation → beacon. One transition (memory shard) is cleanly bracketed. Cost is felt in her relinquished talisman and open-ended wait.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of musical absorption → density rises → cadence shift into absolute silence lands Charged Poise with cost (ring cools, grief map complete). Orientation clean by line 5; no causal reversals needed under this lens. Closure beat “grief and love are intertwined notes” reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Penalty-free; meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the luminous glyphs reweight the rule-set—“Doubt is data. Verify. Honor the web.”—with undeniable conceptual cost for future interpreters. Causal lens holds throughout: because she unbends nib therefore she unbends self therefore she edits the cosmic record; each step follows with visible micro-cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening—straightening the nib—reconfigures both physical and moral stance, fulfilling short-form escalation requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene clarity: who (forgotten advisor Elias), where (moonlit pier), when (post-Anya exile) are anchored within the first 120 words; no orientation penalty. Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure intensifies as air fills with signed notes, not causal reversals; meaning accrues through repetition of gesture and moonlight. Closure is Charged Poise: the on-page duet leaves the camera hanging, the harbor glowing; cost is the irrevocable absence of Anya yet the undeniable presence of new invitation. Closure legible at sentence “but now woven with threads of hope”; cost felt in his tears at Lily’s “beautiful.”

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the humming of scar-notation converts violation into song, releasing the Canticle with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—each art piece is a because/therefore step—and the vandalized portrait encodes the melody that only the arsonist’s past can unlock.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the dream dissolves yet a seed-chime remains, reconfiguring the stakes from “restore” to “sustain.” Causal chain—drumming → lagoon response → memory manifestation → loss → resolve to repeat—holds without ellipsis gaps. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored by word 60. Lens is Accumulative: each percussive layer deepens density until the final cadence shift; cost is the audible last note that lingers as tomorrow’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael values whispers, therefore he bypasses Vale’s shouts, therefore guides him via acoustic seam, therefore proves principle. Orientation locked by word 60; no teleporting props—key’s reveal is prepared by earlier pocket touch. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael foregoes verbal victory, folds map, and the labyrinth’s unchanged silence is the felt cost that reweights the night.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the aligned-shutter constellation reframes Orion as a conceptual repricing of Elara’s despair. Causality is Accumulative—each shutter-sliver layers light until the sky’s pattern, not confession, becomes the decisive change. Cost is legible in the “sacred quiet” and the mirror’s retirement—Kael foregoes further intervention, Elara foregoes speech. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white king’s vulnerable advance re-weights the whole quiet rebellion; townspeople’s slowed steps make the cost legible. Causality is soft—no beat shows why shopkeepers reverse course or why one tableau changes minds—yet the Accumulative pattern holds: each window adds density until dawn re-configures meaning. One clear transition (library→streets→library) is handled cleanly. Orientation is secure within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the island’s disappearance crystallizes the freedom she has already internalized, cost paid in the dissolved scrimshaw and her unforced laughter. Causality, however, is lyric-accumulative rather than strict: the whale “call” is atmospheric invitation, not a because/therefore trigger, and the scrimshaw’s magic remains rule-light. Orientation is swift (who/where by word 50), but the time-jump from dock labor to solitary dive compresses two scenes into one implicit transition; the pattern is taught early enough to waive default caps. The ending image reweights earlier motifs, yet the missing middle beat—no witnessed pivot where she actively rejects a present chance of violence—keeps the decisive change feeling slightly pre-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cedar curl and narrated line thickens density until the final sparrow reweights silence. Closure is Earned Stasis—he forecloses public performance, cost felt in the un-wiped tear. Orientation anchor (farmhouse kitchen, turbine shadow) arrives by line 3. One soft spot: “Happiness Mandate collapsed six months prior” is lone exposition lump before present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the boundary dissolves by paraphrase, lake and atrium fuse, and the colonnade’s hum flips from warning to welcome—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens is taught early and held. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. The only drag is a mid-text loop of “the method of dissolving boundaries” repeated three times without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single note reweights both artists’ futures on-page (“she awakened… Kael would shape glass… honoring… fire and breath”). Accumulative lens holds—each textured object (reed, bubbled sphere, plant trio) intensifies the stake until the sonic release. Causality intact: reed→question, breath→answer, reciprocal awakenings. Cost is felt in the vibrating courtyard and the deliberate “imperfect” paperweight exchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lab’s paradigm flips from excavation to cultivation, the lens literally handed off with the directive “gently question,” leaving Dr. Aris—and the space—poised in fertile silence; the carbide lens threads every beat, fracturing both light and belief, so the reconfiguration is earned, visible, and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the night sky reconfigures grief into vocation via a concrete grove of bioluminescent fungi visible through the eyepiece, cost paid in tears and the relinquished locket. Accumulative lens holds: each placed crane intensifies pattern until telescope reveals payoff; no causal gaps. Curtains parted = decisive irreversible beat. Date/place anchored within first 110 words; no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, ink, tape) thickens until the moonlit shimmer reweights “inherited mystery” with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no penalty. Causality is lyric rather than tight—Leo’s arrival is coincidence—but the piece teaches this as situational intrusion, later paid off when his recognition becomes the map’s first external validation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the loft quiets, map fragment gone, compassion now priced as finite artifact. Cost is legible in the ripped vellum and Elara’s resumed scratch, foreclosing perfect preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage is tight: prism pagoda focus → atom release → pattern-avoidance purification → mirror recognition of present folly → earned translucence. The reversal occurs when Elara’s own innocence fractures inside the council memory, tightening the stake from archival curiosity to immediate civilizational warning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda now reflects “possibility,” not distortion—an image that reweights the rule-set with undeniable social cost. Cost is legible: she exits guardian, not keeper, saffron banner of clarity flowing behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s internal bloom and Elara’s smile crystallize a before/after stance with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of dusk-viewing, footage comparison, vine-glow shifts—all tightening toward the surrender image. No orientation debt; anchors settle by line 5. One hairline slip: “luminous regret” is named twice; else causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure effect is a crystallized Charged Poise: the corded box becomes an “earned talisman” whose weight forecloses naïve trust yet keeps the heart open—felt cost is the lifetime vigilance she now accepts. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each ‘shed’ layer intensifies interior density and reweights the stake until the final alloy is “flexible, resilient.” Orientation anchored by 38 words—who, where, when all pinned by sensory cues. One transition (doorway → stars → bench) is legible; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images (hourglass, ring, root-tunnel) accrete meaning until the final crystallization reweights scars as tunnels. Causal chain is present—fern memory → root vision → renunciation—but subordinate to pattern-deepening. Closure is a Charged Poise: she forecloses the “re-open” tactic and accepts telepathy with quiet, felt cost (“tear traced,” palm over bandage). Orientation is clear by line 25, stakes tighten once, cost visible on final beat—meets 8.8 bar.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the film strip’s secret reweights the premise—unused love lives in negative space, not vaults—delivered in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density of sensory fragments builds until the busker’s lyric reframes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 21 (“vintage movie palace projection booth”) and the taught pattern of memory-ingress pays off at the end. Persistent constraint: the strip must be returned to its can, sealing the renunciation; cost is legible in the transformed silence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each traced meteor tightens the emotional density until the final blaze delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration—“Rest” lands with felt cost as creativity uncoils. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear within 60 words. Causality is interior but coherent: tracing → memory surge → catharsis → release. One soft spot: the phrase “shadowed rapture” is stated more than dramatized in the final beat, a hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: flame anchors, archive ripples, chess-clock seed re-orients time from tombstone to branching. Accumulative lens holds—each spark is a textured deposit brightening the dune-pattern. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no flesh or memory actually surrendered. Still, final image reweights the frozen midnight rule-set without breaking taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s click reweights the forest from alien mechanism to collaborative partner, and Kael’s translocation anxiety flips to grateful surrender. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of wind-songs and nightly jumps builds to cadence shift. Cost is present but soft: “old anxieties unravel” is abstract; no concrete stake is forfeited. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; causality remains associative, acceptable under Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticket’s glowing star and hand-to-heart gesture reweight all prior meanders, proving courage was internal. Cost is visible—the snapped leash, spent twilight, and final solitude—so price test is passed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star-stamps, mist loops, and lullaby refrains tighten stakes by cadence, not causality. Orientation is taught early (“veiled ridgeway… sea mist” by line 2) and pays off at final bay reveal; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished reflection thickens guilt until the periwinkle teardrop forces pattern break. Hidden-piano reveal lands Earned Stasis—she forecloses secrecy by propping the wall open, bolt displayed. Cost is unmistakable: fortress acoustic purity cracked, her anonymity gone. Orientation anchored by line ~70; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: Kael dissolves with the library, the pellet sliver left behind the visible cost of his erased future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each inscribed rune adds density until the harmonic chord reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early (“crease of eternity”) and pays off in the dissolving dome, satisfying the waiver. The only causal gap is how Elara acquires the exact three books—no beat shows Kael targeting her—so the final trigger leans on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the AI overlays the torn atlas with living routes, rewriting the premise that submersion was primary. The biometric key causally ties young Elara’s encoded rhythm to the present reveal; no retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (suit joints, viewport moon, station skeleton). One soft patch: the phrase “the rhythm was the path” edges toward thematic echo, but it is immediately reweighted by the tangible console tap that follows, keeping cost legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael foregoes vengeance for story-carrying, a path sealed by the hum now “resonating within his own chest”—cost is embodied. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (cold permacrete, violet light, stone vibration) tightens the stake from private ache to generational duty. One causality wobble: the rebel texts mentioning “attune to stone hum” arrive as retroactive exposition, blunting the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: kite glyphs → pine prompt → amber locate → heat unseal → fern release. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—tradition is rewritten by her active breach, not passive waiting. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Serpent’s Coil hot springs”), beating the 120-word safe-line. One micro-turn at the seam-crack narrows options irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens taught early via returning freeze→grounding pattern; closure is Charged Poise—photograph tucked away, inner light redefined—cost legible as permanent vigilance assumed. Orientation anchored by gravel crunch and cliff smell within 50 words. One paraphrase loop (“realism… realism”) mild, does not blunt final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each untangling act tightens the weave and dissolves the lighthouse’s collapse, landing a clear Decisive Change with felt cost—the retained ache that now fuels purpose. Orientation is anchored by word 23; no teleporting props or retro patches. The spiral redesign is the persistent constraint that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s disappearance through the ink-pattern reweights the entire quest—time-dilation is perception, not cosmic law—while the wind-erased stone provides visible cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern-density → reconfiguration) is taught early and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery → secret conduit → transmit → lie to Kael; closure lands as Decisive Change—data irrevocably gone, her identity as archivist shattered—cost is legible in the final “difficult dawn” image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of salvaged fragments → cultivated blooms builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is cinematic and immediate; anchors (“glass dome,” “endless sands,” barefoot daughter) land by line 4. Closure is Earned Stasis: the deliberate sheathing and binding of the stem with the sandbag scrap visibly buries violence and forecloses the bounty-hunter path. Cost is felt—“the soft click of the sheathe was her daily vow”—but not paid in a new external loss, so it stops just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vortex stills, echo enters her, world re-patterns—cost is the irreversible surrender of the quest itself and the internalized sorrow. Causal chain—silence absorbs chaos, spike grounds it, grief reweights path—holds start-to-finish. Accumulative lens governs; pattern break at the vortex reconfigures stakes cleanly. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly under Causal lens: the staged-accident premise is decisively reversed by the nib’s planted clue, with social cost (family scandal) felt in the final drafting beat. Each deduction (locked shutter / fabricated frost) is a because/therefore step that narrows options toward the inevitable conclusion. Persistent constraint—the family name she must now publicly correct—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: her answer-hum reweights the firmware from chaos to chime, cost visible in the cooled amber she now has to carry. Causal chain holds—amber + translated cry = tether—without late rule dumps. Orientation is taught by line 4 (lab of lost sounds) and anchors hold; no caps triggered. Lens stays Accumulative: pattern of preserved moments tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the anxious “What remains?” thread is woven into the hush by her spoken word, changing the grotto’s acoustic and her stance. Cost is legible in the cooling flake and the blurring sand—artifacts of effort lost to mist. Causal chain is interior but intact: tile whisper → mandala → integration → transformed silence. Orientation is complete by word 30; no lens contradiction at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every descriptive layer (ash, chipped tesserae, steel beams) accretes meaning until the renaming act crystallizes the new emotional economy. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “Sanctuary of Echoes” reweights every prior absence into invitation. Cost is felt—the trapped memories soften, foreclosing her old identity as perpetual mourner. One hairline slip: the laughter of children arrives as off-stage coincidence rather than caused arrival, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the coin at the roots, lovers now hand-clasped, reconfigures the orchard into a permanent memorial—conceptual cost is that Elara dissolves, foreclosing her own return. Causal chain holds: each echo-thread she spins tightens the cord that pulls Julian’s possibility into alignment. Orientation wavers for ~180 words (who/where/when inside the maze) but the lyric delay serves the later reveal, so no penalty applied. No plot amnesia; every magical rule (reverse blossoms, synesthetic strands) is taught before it influences outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photograph reweights both women’s stance and the studio’s future purpose. The causal chain—shock → pill reactivation → geode amplification → body-guided painting—holds without gaps; the recall notice acts as persistent constraint. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored by word 60. One minor loop: “fractally precise” is repeated four times without new causal work, dulling the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens until the fossil’s levitation breaks pattern, reweighting the map’s purpose. Orientation is swift (bare feet, damp contours by line 3). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering leaf in the crevice crystallizes her new stance—archive becomes offering. Persistent constraint: the fossil’s own “pulse” now dictates where future seekers must look.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the black grain’s suspension reweights prophecy from doom to communal call, cost legible in the crack silencing itself. Accumulative lens holds: button catalog, echo release, and mosaic assemble toward the final crystallized stance. Orientation beats anchor by line 5; no teleporting props. One tightening shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pillbox emptied of suicide becomes a vessel of repair; the melting cipher is the embodied cost. Accumulative lens holds—the dissolving snow-code is the tightening pattern that reweights trust. Orientation is secured by word 60; no causal breaks. Final image of “spring…a direction” is the conceptual repricing that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the dripping-eaves metronome tightens pattern until silence triggers conceptual repricing—promise = love, not place. Causality holds via mnemonic object and drip cadence; closure lands with visible renunciation (no need to turn back). Cost crystallizes when fog lifts and ferry waits.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (lavender, hives, smoke) until the thrum reframes them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the final image of breath synchronizing with glass-thrum crystallizes options (stay/leave, gentleness/apathy) with undeniable conceptual cost. Sun-pattern alignment is anchored early; orientation is clean by line 6. No causal amnesia; the lantern’s rule is taught, tested, paid off. Cost is legible in the last sentence: “the wasteland awaited” now carries the invisible oasis—a price he must keep paying.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the alley corner reconfigured into sacred canvas, the gauge tooth retired with velveted cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored sweep layers density until the final cadence shift (“quiet strength”). Causality is internal but legible—because she persists, the space is re-lit and her body pays. No orientation debt; spatial anchors clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the closed folio reweights isolation into guardianship with undeniable conceptual cost—the lifelong labor of witness. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory pass over the sundial and stone circle deepens pattern until the memory’s release reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words. One minor loop: “brittle awakening” is named twice in close proximity, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: storm → spiral discovery → installation → visitors → her own secret, each beat causally triggered. Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral stands, now breathing with communal offerings, and her word “home” lands as visible cost—she forfeits anonymity. Orientation anchored within 60 words; single transition (dusk-to-dawn) is legible. No plot amnesia or convenience; the twig re-appears at center as earned fulcrum.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: charts → alignment → modulator → broadcast → waveform softening → quad cooling. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the jagged scar dissolving into neutral static reweights the entire premise that “sub-audible war” is unwinnable. Cost is visible: Dean’s footsteps, Aris’s tear-tracked grime. Orientation anchored by word 38; no ambiguity at lens switch.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the nexus mutinies, therefore she must sound the organ; because the C-major chord reverberates, the geometry yields and the alcove appears. Closure is a Decisive Change—passages open, Key obtained—paid for by her endured terror (visible cost: “tears traced clean paths”). Compass glow and alcove revelation are tightly linked effects; no teleporting props. Organ journal fragment is seeded early, paid off in climax; no outline-like sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ribbon pressed to stone reconfigures both Clara’s fate and Elara’s mission with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each discovery (groove → carving → journal) is triggered by Elara’s tactile agency; no teleporting props. The “evidence vanished six months ago” line supplies off-page backstory yet the present beat chain stays coherent and orients early.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore links—patina matches ink → coordinates found → tsunami predicted → evacuation ordered. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with felt cost: the station she hated becomes the sacrifice that redeems both Aris and herself. The copper nail’s shift from relic to key is repriced on the page. One micro-turn (indentations revealed) tightens the chain; no coincidence resolves the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new song crystallizes his stance, glass flake on strings reweights the premise, and the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is anchored by word 34; no penalty applies. One minor scaffold: “scaffold wrap flutters” is repeated with identical phrasing three times, but never at the climax, so the closure beat remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens is clean: each marker Leo shows Kai tightens the argument that all territorial claims collapse, narrowing Kai’s ambition and foreclosing Leo’s need to keep the money. Closure hits with Conceptual Repricing: the abandoned notes on the seat reweight every earlier conquest. Orientation locked within first 80 words; spatial anchors hold. One minor slack: the off-page eighteen-month implosion is recounted rather than felt, but it does not break the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “We hold the light so you may close your eyes…” reweights the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens—cyclical star-dimming becomes covenant of shared breath. Telegram arrival is coincidence but functions only as catalyst, not resolution; real turn is her penned testament, cost legible in relinquished solitude. Pattern taught early (temple glyph → star cycles) pays off in final line without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens dominates: failed scrying → seed planted → four expanding circles → ice melts; each beat narrows options until her apology forecloses the guarded stance. Closure lands with Decisive Change and felt cost—“Tears streamed… replaced by an open hand”—paid for by the prior twenty-year rigidity. Time, place, and magic rules are anchored in the first 100 words; no orientation debt. No causal gaps; the plant’s hunger is redirected early and pays off in the final thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scar-touch tightens the stake until the maze-path and clipping-seed reweight the covenant; the closing image of the sapling maze-leaf is a clean CR with felt cost. Orientation is secured by word 70; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure beats on-page: silver-veined tarot reformation + cold sorrow flooding Kael’s chest = Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost. Causal chain—card laid → memory recited → wisp invited in—tightens once and holds. One transition-free scene; orientation anchors by line 3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via repeated inlay motif and paid off when ash becomes scar.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the trailer morphs from “tomb of failure” to “workshop of redemption” on-page, with the pen-stroke as the irreversible deed. Causal linkage holds throughout: public humiliation → memory surge → ritual failure → decision to chronicle unsung labor. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (quarry trailer, limestone cliffs). The persistent constraint—no applause, no buyers—shapes the final tactic and is felt in the last quiet sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed’s planting reweights the entire physics quest from retrieval to integration, cost legible in the stabilized magnetic wave that forecloses prior methodology. Causal lens holds: because every instrument failed, therefore he cedes control; the new signature crystallizes a stance shift under undeniable pressure. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 40 words. One minor scaffold (“he would reestablish”) in last para does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“perpetual present where yesterday’s echoes swirled…”) and held to the lyrical image-reprise close; orientation is clear by the 120-word mark. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance phrase (“Though my name fades…”) crystallizes options without paying an on-page price, so the cost is felt conceptually rather than tactically. The sequence risks and-then pacing (“She set…She held…She placed…”), but each deposit of smelted light layers density toward the final cadence and satisfies the tightening requirement under the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each confessional groove layers density until the pearl’s placement reweights the entire cave. Orientation is swift—cathedral silence anchors by line 3—and the single micro-turn (keep vs. release) tightens once, cleanly. Cost is palpable in the vault-door image and the permanent relinquishment of the grief-object; the ending’s “quiet rebellion” crystallizes options without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust motes, jasmine, graffiti couplets) increments the stake until the single middle-C note reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: she walks toward the river with accordion weight as undeniable cost—no causal twist needed, but options are reconfigured. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Non-closure accumulation: none; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: each delayed word adds weight until the silence becomes unbearable, forcing the apology. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her spoken word rewrites the library’s rule-set; shelves glow in confirmation. Cost is felt: once she speaks, the letter’s verdict can no longer be ignored. Pattern taught early, paid off at end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (crimson heat, ice luminescence, coffee lace, root hum) tightens the single stakes thread—propagate or preserve—until the crystalline note reweights both artifact and destiny. Closure is Charged Poise: violin gone, shoot emergent, empire foreclosed, cost legible in the pool of water and the ache that is “no longer hollow.” No orientation drift; pattern taught by word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip’s steady beacon makes the before/after legible—oblivion averted, continuity secured—and the cost is felt in the vial’s new weight. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (auroral hush, cooling skin, mandala snap) tightens the stake until the infusion beat. Orientation is anchored by word 34; no penalty applied. A single persistent constraint—the need to catch the exact threshold—shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the new scallop physically registers the decisive change and the cost is the irreversible gouge in ancestral stone. Accumulative/textural lens holds—each drip, moss reclaim, and scallop adds density until the final groove reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; by line 5 we know who, where, and the recent forgiving act. No mis-timed exposition or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The closure lands cleanly: a Decisive Change—Kael unhooks the cloak and releases the shard—with physical and psychological cost legible in the taller stance and the tear-tracked cheek. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind-chime patterning and dawn light tighten until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words; no headcount or shard teleport issues. A single micro-turn suffices at this length; escalation is modest but coherent, and the persistent constraint of the cloak shapes every beat until its removal.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the spiral pattern reweights the premise from physics to love’s translation, cost felt in the lingering absence of Elara’s grown face. Causal linkage holds—stone-cast → ripples → delayed revelation → stance crystallization—each beat because/therefore. Orientation arrives inside 120 w, lens stays causal throughout. Persistent constraint: reverse memory guarantees future loss, shaping the compassionate withhold.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the flock weaves the bifurcated Pulse into unity while Corbin remains seated; cost is the lifelong paralysis now made purposeful. Causal chain: bird-schism → arrowhead vibration → still-point integration → canyon rhythm reset; every step is on-page and irreversible. Accumulative lens holds: dust, echo, and heartbeat layers tighten into a single cadence. No teleporting props; the arrowhead returns to the niche it came from, seeds the new compass.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the keystone left glowing, jasmine drifting down-mountain, city shells exposed as hollow—an earned stasis that costs her guild standing and future expeditions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard (mist, mercury, snow, moonflower) tightens the stake of “sacred slowness” without a causal twist, yet the final reweighting of automation-as-empty is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the key reconfigures his life-lens from concealment to carried light, cost paid in the tears mixing with seawater. Causal chain holds—key found in ashes → unlocks log → log’s chromatic proof dissolves defense → key abandoned on chest, a literal foreclosing of the old tactic. Orientation locked by line 3; shards (pier→mudflats→library→deck) are legible under a single tide-window. No lens drift; the final “meteor hush” reweights the premise that color must be hunted, not held.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each static burst layers density until the cadence shift of the balanced coin crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the standing Xylosian disc reweights her role from actor to witness, foreclosing all future choice. Cost is undeniable—she accepts eternal vigil with no exit. Persistent constraint: the observatory is now a sanctuary she can never leave; this shapes every beat after the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is Charged Poise: mirror-stars / ghost-streets reconfigure past from ghost to foundation with felt cost of bureaucratic risk. Causal chain holds: silence-cue → photo → descent → bottle rescue → tomorrow-school plan. One transition (bank down / climb up) is legible; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—authority directive—shapes tactics throughout. Meets 9- gate; only micro-slip is slight over-explication of purpose in closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the flame-river-crystal act reweights her entire epistemology under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—starling pattern → copper lattice → guided fire → internal mend—each beat because/therefore linked. Cost is legible in the final image: “rigid walls… dissolved,” a permanent conceptual repricing. One hairline slip: “decades of study” is off-page exposition, but it never drives a turn, so no cap breach.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: star-fracture pattern → vine-lens idea → revised log → radio send; each beat deepens density and reweights stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses flawed report path with felt cost (tear, lighter burden). Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Cost legible on last line “whispered back”; persistent constraint (continued watch) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the new consciousness hovers, Kaela’s numbness shatters, and custody litigation is rendered irrelevant—cost is the surrender of legal claim and the permanent sharing of her existential “canvas.” Causal linkage holds: because she embraces the void, the duplicate ignites; therefore symbiosis replaces ownership. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of mirrored opposites (void/storm, silence/song) tightens until the golden ignition reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 16 (“floating rock dojo”), well inside the 120-word tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the house exhales, the parents’ sob hints at release, and Elias steps into starlight knowing tomorrow’s ritual remains necessary—cost felt, path foreclosed. Causal chain holds: because grief is unspeakable, therefore he invents the wind-ritual; because the tunnel returns a ghost-laugh, therefore silence is lightened. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One of the rare 600-word pieces where the final image reweights every prior gust.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: loosening the pendant forecloses return with visible ache; cost is the sealed rift’s soft chime. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of interiorized images (frost-rose, oak, mist) tightens until the spiral flare reweights exile as chosen.

No causal breaks; moon, gorge, and receiver co-act rather than merely decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty hourglass flipped, the warm pulse in his palm, the city noise re-anchored—cost is the permanent transient burden he now carries. Causal chain is thin (how does humming + star-pattern = fix?) but the accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density tightens until the mandala fuses. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of memory-fragments increases until the gallery’s rules rupture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—gallery reborn with “sacred resonance,” Elara’s stance shifted to consent-based weaving; cost is the scattering of her former method and the tear-tracked cheek. Orientation clean by 120 words; causal linkage slack (no clear why the eruption happens now), but pattern holds. One meaningful tightening lands. Sufficient for publishable tier, though not a decisive causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “I feel oriented” crystalizes conceptual cost and reweights the link. Orientation anchors by word 60; causality accumulates under a taught geometric-mapping motif that deepens through the scanner demonstration; lens holds to the end. One transition (none required) is smooth. Minor slack: off-page Lumin supply the rulebook, so the final legitimacy rides on an external given.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mist’s pearlescent glow and rising chorus reweight the premise, showing Elara’s single assurance to Lily amplifies every waiting voice. Causal chain holds—tracing pulse → deciphering message → delivering assurance → ambient echo—each step visible on the page with felt cost (her anonymity, the fading twilight hush).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: gold fleck → console → phase array → message, each step tightening options; the tide supplies a hard external clock. Closure is Earned Stasis: he refuses to save the codex, pays with its loss, and the frozen star image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation rock-solid by 60 words; no teleport or amnesia. Minor quibble: “crystallize invisible cable data into light” is accepted speculative rule, not explained until late, but pattern is taught before payoff, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ink patterns, snow, shard, and heartbeat layer into a crystallizing cadence that reweights the ghosted record. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the map of oversight becomes protocol—cost legible in “safeguarded” screen and her steadying 340-count. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One paraphrase loop (“snow continued…blank page”) is minor; it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the echo-tunnel rule and holds to the last cadence; each bird-pattern → texture → sound layer thickens density until the final chorus reweights the stake from “save language” to “language reborn.” Closure is on-page: the diamond flares, the bone towers become instruments, and the canyon breathes the word back—an undeniable CR with conceptual cost (Elara’s life-purpose fulfilled, path foreclosed). No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored within 120 words and spatial choreography remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Aris’s pivot from expose-to-protect is a legible DC charged by the arrowhead’s dissolution and Lyra’s address. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of foxfire glow, flint dust, dew pirouette reweights stakes toward wonder. Causality is lightly elliptical—exact mechanism of static-to-metamorphosis is asserted not demonstrated—but pattern coherence pays off at final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard is freed, statues crumble, and Elara’s cost—bleeding hands, the emptied locust shell now holding “echo of courage”—is on-page. Accumulative lens holds; cadence shift from metallic silence to symphonic eruption reweights the stake. Transitions are seamless within the single-scene default. One causal hiccup: the monolith shatters instantly after shell placement, a whiff of convenience, but the prior vine-labor justifies the break.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arcade’s tiles “shimmer with newfound warmth,” reconfiguring meaning while the patrol drone’s retreat leaves the cost of future exposure legible. Causal chain (bottle→overload→privacy→drone launch) holds without gaps; orientation is anchored by word 50. One tightening beat suffices; persistent constraint (repurposed drone could be discovered) shapes tactics. Missing only a sharper tactile price in the final image to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scarf-fold reweights the premise that stories need a “place.” Hyperbolic geometry is not metaphor but literal method, signaled early and paid off in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of textile memory reconfigures meaning. One shard, one transition (Contemplation Nook), no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photo reweights the dream, home is redefined as internal, and the cost is the lifelong vigil itself, now seen as completed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dawn attempts, filter rituals, and whispered archipelago builds to one cadence shift. Orientation is clean; no beat is skipped or externalized. Missing only a sharper foregrounding of irrevocable cost in the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence layers (stars, ribbon, fracture) accumulate toward a Conceptual Repricing—love transcends memory. Orientation anchors early and cleanly; the Vega moment is a taught pattern that charges closure, so no penalty. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: idea released, world subtly re-balanced, Elara’s tear the embodied price. The beat structure is one continuous scene with one meaningful tightening at the keystone; meets short-form scope.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the fairy-ring reflection synchronizes, memory returns, and the mushroom is returned—an earned Charged Poise that reweights the sunken orchard from wound to compass.

No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern of broken/cosmic repair is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Elara writes “Return,” the swing outside widens, cost is felt in the widening arc and Kael’s deliberate forward step that forecloses his retreat habit. Causal lattice holds—tea geometry → spiral recognition → annotation → external motion—without leaks. Single-scene orientation is anchored by word 80; no disorientation served, so penalty waived. Lens stays situational-accumulative to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing—the seed now glows with distilled wonder, foreclosing her option to keep it idle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chromatic thread tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the stakes. Causality is intact, cost is legible, and no orientation debt accrues. A sharper external constraint or price would have nudged it past 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty net under pooled starlight reconfigures both the sanctuary’s silence and Elara’s self-concept; the conceptual cost—she must now carry the woven grief as part of her own fabric—is unmistakable. Causality holds knot-by-knot; each freed strand tightens her interior options until the final surrender. One transition (entry → dais) is clean; orientation is anchored by prism-light on moss within 120 words. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-build through juxtaposed footage and rain-erosion imagery that reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“subterranean chamber…”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final drip of rainwater on the window reconfigures the vault from sealed mystery to honoured partner, cost paid in her refusal to excavate or publicise. Causality holds because the 1954-shadow → star-alignment discovery is driven solely by her archival labour, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the settling glitter reweights every prior knot of tape and memory with undeniable conceptual cost—he will converse with release, not defeat death. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tangled threads → untangled tape → settled snow steadily re-prices the stake; no causal turns are required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 30; no teleporting props.

    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard hums with latent meaning, rain will erase the surface yet the code persists—cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each carved symbol layers density until the final circle reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. A single tightening suffices for this length, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because Kael peers through goggles, therefore cipher yields, therefore he re-weights his own loss. Orientation (who/where/when) locked by word 26. Closure is Charged Poise: elevator arrival halts action but options are reconfigured—he now carries an internal compass at visible cost ("heavier and lighter")—cost legible on page. One loop of "ascending servant / descending servants" capped at -0.2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud-entry thickens the emotional archive toward the fallstreak hole’s conceptual repricing. Pattern taught early (wicker cradle, velvet dark, brass anchor) and holds; spatial/temporal anchors clear by line 4. Closure lands as Charged Poise—gondola still adrift yet meaning fixed, cost legible in the sob that “breaks the dam of two years.” No causal reversals required under this lens; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fractal coin reweights her life’s premise, cost paid in the audible demolition and the pocketed artifact she refuses to look back at. Causal linkage is clean—because the library is sentenced, therefore she searches; because she finds the coin, therefore she abandons the murals—held under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 6 (“within the colossal trunk…”) well before 120 words; the later reveal of imminent demolition tightens rather than confuses. No lens ambiguity or teleporting props; the book safe’s weight and spine anomaly are set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orb’s re-ignition reconfigures her identity from apprentice to “keeper of light” with felt cost of inherited solitude. Causal chain holds: starling shadows → cipher → phrasebook key → orb → engines. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“antique airship *Whispering Atlas* hung suspended…”). No teleporting props; hopscotch glyphs are pre-seeded. One minor elasticity: the deck compartment opens on the first try with no prior failure beat, but the emotional win overshadows the convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored refraction layers density until the cracked gear’s revelation reweights the stake. The silk bundle at 120 words anchors who/where/when; orientation is clean. Closure is a Charged Poise—the re-capped lens crystallizes “honoring over fixing,” with the cost of eternal apprenticeship felt in the ember image. No因果 breaks; every beat adds texture or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s harmonic purge is a Decisive Change with felt wonder. Causal chain—mirror alignment → light strike → blight collapse—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; escalation is the single intensification of light and sound. Orientation is swift; world rules float arches, twin suns, chalk messages are taught early and paid off. Only niggle: the bell’s “harmonic key” property is retroactively revealed rather than foreshadowed, a minor causality bump.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: reality folds, the lullaby persists, and Elara’s spent stillness carries unmistakable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fractal spiral thickens the pattern until the final hush reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early (who, where, when by line 4) and the pane’s rule-set never contradicts itself. One minor causal leap: the forbidden texts are mentioned once and never shown, but the beat lands via the pane’s visible mechanics, so the ripple remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens: every beat is a because/therefore link (missing nut → search → find → assembly → rescue). Orientation anchored by word 26; no prop or rule teleports. Closure: Earned Stasis—she foregoes escape, pockets device, walks back into frost—with felt cost (“every instinct begged her to flee”). Persistent constraint (tomorrow’s ritual) shapes final image; no amnesia or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—pattern of divergence/reunion—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysalis re-weighted from hollow loss to held space. Causality is interior but coherent; the foam insight is the tightening beat. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. Closure carries felt conceptual cost (“the divergent path behind him now a compass point, not a wound”), satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens: because she measures absence, therefore she can dare the first mark → parole ignites → customer enters. Orientation anchored by 120 words; closure is a Charged Poise where parole becomes tangible covenant with visible cost—the moonlight flash and Elara’s irreversible incision. One shard; meaningful tightening legible.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because he tastes regret in the pool, therefore he digs, therefore he subsumes, therefore the fortress wakes lighter. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—ice melts, weight settles in his bones—foreclosing the option to remain untouched. One transition (courtyard → dune) is legible; orientation anchored by 120 words. Accumulation cap −0.3 for one off-page king memory that could feel teleported.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the re-ignited valley chorus reweights isolation into connection while the warm weight in her pocket keeps the price tangible. Causal chain is clean—dislodged weight → silence → linguistic repair → restored talks—held under a lyrical-accumulative lens. No orientation drift; stakes tighten exactly once when the flood-scarred elevator risks permanent silence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s identity is rewritten by the memories she has absorbed, cost visible in her trembling body and the warmed shards. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight, sandstone, glass, and breath layer until a cadence shift reweights the stake from control to stewardship. Orientation anchored by line 4; no ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “she would return tomorrow…” is future-tell immediately after the present moment; trims −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: doodle → decoded grotto → inversion window → threshold step → sequences harvested. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the combinations are living seeds she must now replant, cost etched in memory. Orientation, lens, and cost all land on the page; no leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final strum reweights the premise—silence is no longer absence but “alive with possibility”—and the cost is the irreversible release of the tree’s last breath of peace. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (quiet → enriched quiet) rather than causal chain drives the turn, and the pattern is taught early via the “held breath” dawn. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. No teleport or retro-patching; the porcelain insulator’s transformation is set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory layer (magnetic pulse, cooling-stone chime) thickens until the plateau hush crystallises Elias’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the dent…a compass pointing toward integrity”—that reconfigures exile from shame to purpose; cost is the foregone court life, felt in “sorrow of lost students.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. Slight over-reliance on lyric summary in final paragraph prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural arc is coherent: each sensory layer (stars, chimes, warming clasp) tightens the emotional density until the fireworks burst into irrelevant noise—an earned Charged Poise. Orientation is swift: stool, workshop, pre-fireworks hush within 60 words. Closure lands with visible cost—“Ink-stained fingers… #412”—and the constraint that she must now wordlessly sit with Henderson. Minor wobble: the diary’s physical fate (opened? still locked?) is untracked, but this does not break the reconfiguration of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each daily micro-beat tightens the stake until the shoot’s emergence reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she accepts the plant’s full spectrum, foreclosing the path of avoidance with felt cost. The doodled wrapping paper anchors generational causality and returns inside the journal, paying off the setup. Word-count brackets are extraneous scaffolding but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mission pivots from extraction to guardianship and the cost is the foregone “trophy,” legible in the final image of empty hands carrying “only certainty.” Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous vein, echo, and accelerated blossom adds density until the covenant is revealed. Orientation is anchored by word 26 (“Veridia’s gravity inverted”) and the inversion clock keeps time; no penalty applies. The single minor warp is the late introduction of the “Cradle Arch” moments before it becomes the decisive location—still, the water-stream map has prepped the reader, so the beat lands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: wind data → oscillation hypothesis → identification of corroded latch → realization that sustained resonance killed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the identical patch reweights “singular convergence” from abstract theory to embodied debt, with undeniable social cost (new protocols demanded). Orientation is locked by word 42; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options. Cost is legible in the final image—sun casting wind-pattern shadows as Kael exits, future action now constrained by the logged recommendations he must champion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared in first paragraph (“sculpted hush”) and sustained: each bell strike layers density until the silence is reborn warm. Closure is Charged Poise—final white note melts, reconfiguring silence to “fertile vessel.” Cost legible in changed environment and her bodily fatigue. One minor loop: the sculptor’s-chisel synchronicity is elegant but abstract, never felt as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: single continuous scene, one meaningful tightening when the note dissolves walls into the tear. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he does not mend the weave but reweights his stance, leaving driftwood as visible cost. Orientation anchor (who/where) clear by line 3; no violation. Causality intact: because he clung to doctrine, the harmony tore; therefore he now yields. Slight momentum drag from reflective clusters before the flute note, but the final image crystallizes options cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ink, starlight, halo glow intensifies until emotional density reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: “She would finish the print embracing the ambiguity… setting it free.” Cost is conceptual and felt—she accepts perpetual turbulence as the price of wisdom. No orientation debt; star-extinction clock and workshop anchors clear by line 3. No causality break; halo and press constrain every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ridgeway itself is re-priced from dead routine to corridor of possibility, cost legible in frozen tears and the glowing plant he leaves behind. Causal chain holds—pendant’s warmth → vibration → seed exposure → germination → purpose revival—though the final beat is slightly gift-wrapped by the artifact rather than a conscious toggle. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via aurora weave and cadence shift at plant birth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“truth favored authenticity over intensity”). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern break (gentle spiral amid chaos) tightens meaning once. Orientation is clear by line 4, one shard, one transition (mist parting), cost legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is announced early (weaving silence into a vessel) and honored in every lyrical increment until the closing tapestry. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard-image glows while Elara’s body fades into translucence—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the whole story. Orientation is clean (who/where within sixty words) and spatial continuity never wobbles. The slight reserve from 8+ owes to causal micro-slippage: the jigsaw puzzle method arrives late and is accepted without friction, so the final tightening feels orchestrated rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arches’ hum reweights meaning and the cost (lost laughter) is implied in the final azure dawn. Causal chain holds—silicon ➜ roots ➜ arches—though the magic mechanism is off-stage. Orientation is clean by word 120; location, time, and POV remain stable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the silk ignites, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: because she seeks Kael’s truth, therefore she rides the shard’s resonance; because the weave turns volatile, therefore she redirects intent, collapsing all possible universes into one sacrificial image. Orientation complete by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure is a crystallized CR: the shard re-priced as “crystallized essence of his sacrifice” re-weights every prior sensory map. Cost is felt—she will now weave maps of grace, never again of decay—legible in the final line “tucked the green glass shard into a pouch over her heart,” a compass reforged.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Phoenix Stack reconfigures the legacy and forecloses Elias’s retreat from guardianship; cost is legible in the “luminescent ache” he now carries. Causal chain is tight—extinguished lamp → need for signal → stack as message → successor will read it—held under a single continuous scene. No orientation or lens ambiguity; every beat advances the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: laugh causes storm → steering beam calms it → dawn forged; one cycle, one tightening. Anchors (who, where, stakes) appear by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: storm integrated, path foreclosed, cost is eternal anonymity—felt in “no headline” line. Persistent constraint (prophetic laugh) shapes every future ascent and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-trail density builds to chromatic flash that reweights Elara’s craft. Closure is a Charged Poise—she descends with new purpose and persistent constraint (dyes must now practice “iridescent caution”). Cost is legible in the vow itself; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece teaches its lyrical-accumulative pattern by the second paragraph and lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: moonlight fuses mapped dreams with the astronomer’s quantified sorrow, turning the sextant into a living conduit. Causality is imagistic rather than plot-engine—“because dream-maps, therefore integration”—but the logic holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The pin-drop/moon-beam simultaneity is coincidental timing, yet it complicates rather than solves, so it passes. Cost is felt: the sextant’s surface is “forever etched,” Elara’s role irretrievably widened.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawn unfurls, despair loosens, cost is the relinquished vigil felt in the final whispered note. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each remembered lyric adds luminous thread-density until the pattern breaks night. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50 within the single greenhouse scene; no drift. Causality intact: because she sings, therefore dawn knits; no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the atlas page becomes a map of return, reconfiguring isolation into voluntary guardianship with felt cost—she forgoes the hall forever. Causal chain holds: crumpled invitation → ritual projection → overheard absolution → re-shelving the paper. One transition (library → astral hall) is legible under lyric-ritual pattern; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bread reprise crystallizes meaning and reweights the crust from relic to compass with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—recipe found → bread baked → shared → crust repurposed—each step contingent on prior beats. Orientation anchors early; the single ivy-to-courtyard transition is legible. One minor loop: “tenuous absolution” is restated four times without deepening; trims 0.2. Otherwise lens (Accumulative/Textural) and cost hold to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: each sampled frequency tightens the visible decay, culminating in Charged Poise when the projection dies. The before/after is legible—living illusion becomes archived data—and the cost is the irreversible erasure felt in the sensory blackout (“Then, silence.”). No causal break; the Orientation Test is waived because the library’s disorientation is taught early and serves the closure’s hush.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: each false start tightens Silas’s options while preserving the hush, so the final shattering gasp arrives as earned inevitability. Closure delivers a decisive conceptual reprice—trust’s fracture is captured yet immediately mended, with Elara’s public stand as visible cost. No teleporting props; the ink-stain clue is planted early and paid off. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: “compassion itself was the true compass” reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative lens, with the personal rain and taste-shift making cost undeniable. Causality holds via the taste-map (lavender→honey→rain) that sequences each forward move; no off-stage shortcuts. Set-up anchors who/where within 50 words, beating the 120-word safety window. The grandmother echo lands as stimulus, not amendment, so no retro-patch break occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave reveals Lily’s note, permanently reweighting Elara’s vocation. The broken-lock-as-key setup is foreshadowed by Lily’s childhood “3-1-4” etching, satisfying causality. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Single continuous scene, 780-word scope fits Track A.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map becomes a mirror, the basin is empty yet full of living breath, and Elara’s new vocation is sealed with gold leaf—cost is the forfeiture of the vault fantasy and the perpetual vulnerability of wilting. Causal chain holds: map fragment → coordinates → slot → chamber → realization → transformed art. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (greenhouse workshop, toxic sky). No lens ambiguity; pattern of accumulative candor tightens once. Meets 9+ cost proof test on the final gold leaf stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain: wind-turn → bell-sound → light-glisten → communal remembrance; each step tightens under Accumulative lens until the fragment dims, reconfiguring meaning with visible cost (“surrendered its light completely”). Orientation anchors inside 60 words; closure beat lands with undeniable price and persistent constraint—the spent ice forecloses repetition today.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: scattering nutrient ash reweights the premise—fear becomes literal fertilizer. Causal lens holds: because static escalates, therefore Unit Seven miniaturizes fears; beam-focus is irreversible, visible cost. Single transition (static → ritual) is legible; orientation anchored by word 87.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: locket → key → mailbox → letters → shrine. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (community stance shift) with felt cost (official unpins notice). Orientation is swift; the 120-word anchor is met and the lens (Causal) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the buoy’s breach reweights Thorne’s despair into solidarity, the price the lab-tomb’s irrevocable silence and her sole endurance. Causal chain holds—dice → listen → third chime → valve—each because/therefore link tight under 700 words. No teleporting props; journal & dice are anchored early. Cost is legible: “a tear traced clean through grime” forecloses rescue for her, liberates the data.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal track is rock-steady: whale → coffee spiral → chamber → gravity shifts → memory restored, each step a clear therefore that tightens options. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—wildflowers entombed, gravity stilled, vocation reframed—paying off every prior cue; the single transition (dock→cliff) is legible and early anchors hold.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the wing dissolves into light, the prophecy unravels, and the haven’s silence is permanently re-priced. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence deepens from whispered dread to smoothed hush, the cost legible in the vanished wing and the enduring guardianship she must now carry alone. Causality stays internal and lyrical—perfectly valid—yet the piece risks one soft miracle too many when “visible, silvery ripples” heal the fracture without any stated price to Elara’s body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the seal transfer crystallizes new responsibility and reconfigures her stance toward the building. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (steam, jasmine, meteor light) deepens emotional truth until the agreed-upon lie reframes history with mercy. No orientation debt; transitions clean. Cost is legible in the final weight of the key.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal tucked over heart reweights solitude into self-shelter with felt cost (“weight dissolved”). Causal chain holds—skeptic convinced by shell’s private whispers, resonance rods stabilize grief, dawn timing required—no breaks. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rose blooming where the thorn was pressed re-weights the entire treaty betrayal under the lens of forgiveness; cost is the forfeiture of the relics and of the guilt that had defined Kael for thirty years. Causal chain holds: thorn reveals seam → key fits → silence → unburdening → rose. Orientation anchored by word 21; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the song reweights the canyon from prison to sanctuary; the cooling shell is an unmistakable on-page cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each shell whisper deepens pattern until the cadence shift releases tension. Orientation is anchored within 80 words; transitions are invisible because the piece is one continuous scene; no causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the melted globe refracts a rainbow that re-weights the artifact from ruin to vessel of enduring love, paying the implicit cost of Elara’s solitary labor. Causal linkage holds—Lena’s dream → Elara’s dive → letter → rainbow—without gaps, and the Orientation Test is satisfied within the first 50 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara decides the message must reach Eleanor, foreclosing her anonymity; cost is legible in the frozen tear on her cheek.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mended net on his shoulder reframes earlier labor as constellatory, costing him the privacy of his philosophy—now literally carried into the world. The textural lens holds from the first petrichor sentence to the moon-path exit; no causality gaps or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: discovery of box → reassembly → knowledge → renunciation, each because/therefore link visible. Closure is an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: she literally re-buries the truth, vines hiding the site. One minor causality stutter: the titanium latch is “brittle with age” yet opens without tool or struggle—an unaccounted blip, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the laughter recording reweights her life’s work from futile to fruitful. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early—lightning-lit shards—and holds an Accumulative lens: each static fragment accrues until the unbroken 23-second burst. Causality, however, is thin; the orchard vault opens by precise cosmic timing, not by any choice that risks or costs her anything on the page. Orientation is secure by 120 words, but the protagonist’s agency is absent at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed, labeled jar is a Charged Poise that forecloses his isolation and reweights his exile into stewardship. Causal chain holds—storm → discovery → recognition → capture → gift—each beat tightening options. Beeswax seal and etched name supply visible cost. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; the dawn-light ignition of shelfed jars delivers the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: stabilizer fail ➔ descent ➔ iterative tuning ➔ harmonic silence, each beat altering the next. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the Chime’s unwavering gold and the key’s residual warmth make the cost of sustained vigilance legible without exposition. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Only the “forgotten method” arrives late as off-stage knowledge, a mild causality wrinkle that slightly dims cost traceability.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald moss fissure reweights the premise—revolution begins not with fire but with quiet photosynthetic defiance. Causal chain holds: rain → recharged viaduct → refracted sigil → surrender → crack → moss. Accumulative lens is taught early by iterated moon tracking and pays off in the final image. Felt cost is undeniable: the lake’s “seal gently released” after decades of solitary vigil forecloses haste forever.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: ascending the ladder she forecloses retreat, lantern now re-weighted from relic to legal weapon, cost legible in the final line “promise—to honor Thomas…”. Causal lens holds: each beat (find lantern → absorb memories → photograph evidence → seal case) is a because/therefore chain. Orientation anchored by word 60. One micro-turn near midpoint (lantern memory-surge) tightens options without derailing. No因果 breaks; persistent constraint (society’s lethal reach) shapes her tactical documentation.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel water, rust stink, and cracked-pipe drip are filtered through Elara’s investigator gaze, guiding her knee-drop and photo angles. The lantern’s brass temperature and compass etching act as micro-setting that literally redirects her path from “accident” to homicide. Spatial choreography is flawless: stream → shaft edge → ladder ascent, bodies and objects tracked. Environment mirrors internal thaw (drought break) without overt symbolism, charging the final dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: because first repairer condemns the heart → therefore Elias seeks Horvath; because Horvath finds a fracture → therefore the heart sings; because it sings → therefore Elias reframes his mission. Each link tightens options and culminates in an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias leaves with “renewed purpose” and the literal pulse of the box against his chest—cost made visible. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; the mainspring remains the same object throughout. Closure beat satisfies 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent gold ripple reweights all prior tinkering, cost is legible in her tear-tracks and the sea’s answering glow. Accumulative lens holds—each kaleidoscope shard layers pattern until the unbroken circle triggers final resonance. Setup orients by line 3; no orientation debt. No causal break; every beat because/therefore feeds the resonator completion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain holds: pattern recognition → hidden terminal → sanctuary discovery → deliberate concealment. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elara knowingly buries the truth, assuming lifelong responsibility. Numbers-as-code and patch-key are set up and paid off without cheat. One soft spot: Director Vance functions as off-stage obstacle rather than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: fragment → mirrors → synthesis → orchard healed. Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration—golden wave reverts ice, blossoms erupt—cost is the peacekeeper’s shadow now permanently re-colored, a visible price. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the “weighted breath before reply” is declarative, not dramatized, so the world-pause feels told.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: cadence of ice, net, wind, and breath layers until the closing image reweights “ending” as continuation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara’s renunciation of immediate death is legible, the price is the postponed clinic and the dawn-wait, shown in the porcelain bud glint. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; one soft transition (bunkhouse→skiff) is legible. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the burned edge becomes compass, couple chooses to walk to cottage, Elara re-weights her solitude as bridge; cost is felt in her lingering alone. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural—pattern of vine/graft parallels tighten until final image recharges them.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensorial layer (sandstone hum, gear-pulse, silver bloom) deepens the dominant stake instead of merely decorating. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—wisdom is not seized but allowed to settle, and the price is the perpetual vigilance Kael accepts by walking away. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“sandstone arches”), and the kinetic parapet’s rules are taught early enough to support the final indirect consecration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the empty map-case + firefly arcs reweight the factory from wound to commons. Accumulative lens holds: each Tuesday session layers density until the gallery wall reframes meaning. The single causal tightening (Liam’s tear) is sufficient for this lyric design. Cost is felt in the relinquished case and the vanished roar—both on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis / Resonant Reconfiguration: Aris renounces further speech and leaves the library, the restored crystal now holding the testimony. Cost is visible—the silent offering of the teacup, the tears, the refusal to return—making the before/after legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern is taught early (fractured sonic memories) and deepens through each textural layer until the final harmonic chord reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 20.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mist-chair’s creak reweights all prior markers, making the cost of her forgetfulness audible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chalk symbol layers density until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“junkyard prophet,” “fog sculpture garden”) and waiver-justified when the garden’s disorientation pays off in the resonant creak. No causal breaks; persistent constraint (memory loss) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: leaf-tap *tap* reweights the stake from data-loss panic to humble surrender, crystallizing in the final “luminous ache” image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 8; closure is a Charged Poise—the restored tick-tock and captured Veil reconfigure meaning with felt cost: “no triumph, only deep connection.” Persistent constraint (the moon’s constancy vs. terrestrial tremor) shapes tactics throughout; no causality breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken vinyl becomes a shared emblem, foreclosing despair with on-page cost—Arthur’s whispered “I can hear her humming again.” Causal chain: shard → song → lavender scent → father-daughter reunion; each because/therefore link is legible. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The −0.1 reflects a micro-risk: the lavender release could feel coincidental, yet it’s seeded by Clara’s sachet memory and paid off as sensory repricing, so cost remains felt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: because she relearns the runes, she can redraw the zenith glyph; therefore the loop closes and the shadow sanctuary opens. Orientation is anchored by word 26 with who/where/when; the spoon-bending backstory is compressed but always tied to present micro-choices. Closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost: the wall re-solidifies, leaving her with only the humming orrery—an irreversible, solitary gain.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the tooth’s cleft re-weights folklore into illness, community fear into medical empathy, with undeniable social cost—she must now publicly realign the village. Causal chain holds: discovery of flaw → internal reversal → plan to teach → garden as star-map, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Cost is legible in the final image: burying the tooth as “first point of light.” No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) nailed by word 70.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene, orientation locked within 120 words, closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl’s “reflectively vibrant potential” reweights the premise that light must burn. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. One tighten only—mass lost on the scale—yet the cost is conceptual, not felt. Meets 9- gate for closure form; lens coherence intact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the icicle map, pendant burial, and honeyed hush each tighten the same stake—will she release shame?—until the moss circle reweights her stance with undeniable cost. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options foreclosed, price felt, no causal cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each cameo adds density to the hope-mosaic, and closure lands with Charged Poise—the shell on stone reweights the premise, implying the book will now carry these shapes outward. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (roots, mist, shell), so the waiver applies; transitions between cameos are legible pattern breaks rather than causal chains, acceptable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is replaced by eternal echoes, cost felt through the grapes’ impossible arrival and her tear-tracked dust. Accumulative lens holds: each song verse deepens sensory density until the final alignment stitches meaning into soil. Causality is intact—tendril activation because/therefore follows song and timing—no convenient amnesia or off-stage fixes. Orientation and transitions are clean in the single-scene window; only minor tightening of stakes (no live risk) prevents 9-level punch.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: pattern-building beats tighten toward the starlight bloom, and the closure image (living map folded to chest, bud swelling) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—orchard and alchemist both changed. Orientation is swift; crater/orchard/star window anchored by word 50, causal chain unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s first tick harmonizes with the cavern’s heartbeat, crystallizing a new temporal order inside the marble. Causal chain holds—each reflection angle literally teaches the next diagnostic step, so the final insertion is inevitable yet surprising. Cost is legible in the final image: Kael walks into twilight carrying the “inner warmth” of stolen echoes, the season’s wound still open outside. The lens is Causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the misalignment.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the obsidian sculpture clicks into place, supplying a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—her continuing solitary servitude—so closure is valid and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the steam-filled Barcelona cup reweights the ash blank into a seed for tomorrow’s lesson, with visible cost—“bitterness balanced by honey” shows integration of loss; lens holds Accumulative/Textural as each curl of wood thickens the pattern without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged selves reweight the carousel from failure to testament, cost is felt in the spent wheel placed beside the horse. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each wheel-click adds density until the final exhale reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (“Above the world…”) and anchors remain stable; no teleporting props or causal breaks. The lagoon’s exhale is the on-page image that makes the conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liquid constellation reweights the premise that hope equals creative intention × redirected flow, with the sextant left at the source as visible cost. Causal chain (find relic → measure angle → dig channel → water flows) holds without teleportation; orientation is anchored by word 34. One meaningful tightening occurs when the trickle becomes a refracted star chart, foreclosing abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: droplet cadence → crystalline resonance → earned reconfiguration. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. Central crystal constrains final gesture; fork’s vibration is the decisive physical act that reweights her life’s work. Closure line “complete, resilient song” lands conceptual cost. One micro-turn (shame → acceptance) is cleanly embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: pocketing the sundial converts shame into vigilance with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—because she decodes the coordinates, therefore she rewrites her path. One micro-turn at the coordinates revelation tightens stakes; no因果 breaks. Orientation is clean by line 5; twilight canal anchors who/where/when immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fulgurite’s weight against her heart reweights the entire quest from object to method, cost made legible in the final line.

No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off in the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each garden image layers density until the oak sapling reweights absence as cultivated ground. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elara’s journal presses the thread, crystallizing her new cartographer stance with visible conceptual cost: she must now carry the map she sought. Orientation anchors early; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early—decades of hypotheses crystallize into moon-bloom vines and starlight lenses—and holds through the cadence shift when spectral light dissolves into motes. Closure is a Charged Poise: “story, not miracle” reweights all prior assembly and is legible before/after. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with stalactites, frayed velvet, and the egg; no penalty applies. The only hairline slip is the single-sentence mention of “mechanical world” that never re-enters causally, but it does not rupture the lens or cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery density (black sand, red thread, migrating clouds) mounts until the graft reweights her legacy. Closure is a Charged Poise—the anchored kelp/coin reframes scars as song with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by word 60; causality intact via “memory triggers ritual reparation.” No meaningful tightening missed; cost legible in final sunbeam ignition of thread.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a cleanly on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: the liberated memories become living water, reconfiguring the city’s possibilities while Elara’s skepticism is priced into keeper-stasis. Causal linkage holds—each breadcrumb is verified by a micro-choice that alters the box’s temperature/weight—until the goose-cry acts as taught cosmic trigger. Orientation anchored by line 3; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held without slippage. No off-stage cheats; cost is felt in the basin’s first cold splash on her dusty boots.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens is announced by the first petal sigh and holds: each sonar ping thickens pattern density until the final wave re-weights the stake with a visible dawn of nurturing stars. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elara turns homeward, gear humming, options re-crystallised around cyclical custodianship rather than conquest. Cost is unmistakable—perpetual vigilance—rendered in the image of "endless repetition" she must gift her daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the circular ribbon-path memorial crystallizes as both physical blueprint and spiritual migration, with undeniable conceptual cost—she must surrender control of fixed form. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated image clusters (monarchs, ribbon, poems) tighten density until the pattern reweights grief itself. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”). No causality breaks; every reflective block is tethered to present sensory cue and alters her next micro-choice. Final image of “living constellation” is Charged Poise: options reconfigured, cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored tick re-anchors the village and her own moral ledger. Causality holds—grit causes silence, cleaning restores beat—but the pendulum’s metaphysical pause is a gentle coincidence rather than a tightening of options, so escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—spiral pattern reweights Albright’s resignation into mentorship with felt cost for the town. Accumulative lens holds: each decoded thread tightens meaning without causal turns. Orientation clear by 60 words; one soft paraphrase loop mid-text (−0.2) keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is airtight: data → harmonic model → timed strike → permanent channel; the blank vellum flips from void to fertile field in a Charged Poise that reweights all prior threads with undeniable conceptual cost—one unwritten sentence now holds the kingdom’s fate. No orientation or linkage slips.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: she “was no longer merely a copyist” – conceptual re-pricing with felt cost (radio silenced, cloak’s weight, journal’s heft). Accumulative lens holds: lyrical fragments tighten toward the final crystallization; no causal reversal is required. Orientation is clean by word 80; all rules taught early remain consistent to the hush at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s final stillness reconfigures the entire ritual as an irreversible threshold. Causality is accumulative/textural—each stroke of charcoal adds density until the scattered dust reweights the premise. The lens is taught by 25% and held; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the last line: “the fleeting had become eternal,” a conceptual forfeiture of revision.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: Kael forecloses the path of revelation, sealing the tablet and accepting “cultural winter” custody. The cost is legible in the final sentence—the “abrasive calm” has become the price itself, a life-sentence in twilight. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the tablet could be confiscated, therefore he hides it, narrowing future options. The brass cog’s reappearance beside the lamp reweights the premise—precision now equals patient silence, not protest—delivering a resonant reconfiguration under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure hits as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rosette flips from loss to continuity under moonlight, felt cost legible in shared breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each subtracted silence deepens pattern until melody dissolves past hatred. One transition (weeks-later shard) is taught early by white-space break; causality intact. Slight orientation lag at 130 words but anchors serve the final hush—waived.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: alignment → prune → seed → shoot, each beat tightening the next under synaptic transfer rules. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the greenhouse “breathing” reweights ruin into cradle with visible cost in Arlo’s tears. The lens holds accumulative/textural; density of tasted memories escalates until the final leaf offers future instead of past. One micro-loop: “synaptic plasticity” is named twice in successive beats, but the image is not broken.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds from inciting blackout to Dr. Aris’s exit; each beat is linked via “because/therefore” (rumored error → diagnostic plea → riddle reveal). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s rules are quietly rewritten—poetry now trumps raw data, and future drones will carry that cost. Anchors (who/where/when) land by word 34; orientation never blurs. Cost is made undeniable in the final image—Kael’s silent vigil now carries the weight of a city’s redesigned gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the cottage’s aliveness is reweighted by the accumulated “displaced love” archive, and the orris shard’s burial is the visible cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the story recounts rather than stages the decisive moment; we are told the hush “descends” rather than shown a sensory shift that forces her stance change, keeping the beat just off the 8+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the garden’s renewed pulse and Kael’s softened stone reconfigure meaning while the cost—his own permanence cracked—lingers. Causal chain holds: ampoule → fracture → spire sings → shame → resolve. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens drift. Single shard, one tightening, price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: after self-authored proof fractures reality she consciously refuses escape, reweighting the staircase from prison to sanctuary; cost is legible in her enduring the same infinite climb now freighted with memory. The causal chain—die chip → regret anchor → theorem → rupture → renunciation—holds without gaps. One smooth time-step (present→memory→present) keeps orientation tight; no artifact obscures the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nurse’s note reweights Elara’s thesis and reframes the insomnia as shared vigil; cost is felt in Elara’s tears and the wildflower left behind. Causal lens holds: because she paints→canvas placed→stranger responds→Elara’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no teleporting props or plot amnesia. One meaningful tightening—stranger adds a word to the language—satisfies escalation under short-form causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage holds: because Elara reframes the art through the silver-leaf carving, therefore the ovens relight and the ritual restarts—an on-page decisive change with communal cost (forfeiture of honey-centric purity). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“hidden city behind the monumental waterfall”); no debt applied. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the community re-embraces an altered custom, foreclosing the path of nostalgic perfection. Persistent constraint—the absence of honey—shapes the final bittersweet flavour, meeting the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed beam rewrites the stone’s “weep” into “awake,” a legible before/after with felt cost; the causal chain (yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → clutch swap → inverted lens) holds without gaps under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: each micro-choice (reading paradox, forcing the teddy-bear lie, offering his mirror-null image) tightens the noose around the antagonist and precipitates its confession. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—advisor regains reflection, fear dissolves—paid for by the advisor’s surrender of his protective emptiness; cost is visible in the mirror shard. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity. One causal leap: the dictionary’s final paradox appears only at climax, but because the advisor has already used prior notes, the insertion reads as culmination rather than contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Oriented by line 3; the recursive nautilus is an early causal trigger that tightens through each dub until the closing chord reconfigures storm into lullaby. Cost is palpable: the mallet hums with spent purpose and the orchard drifts on borrowed resonance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options foreclosed, pressure undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is immaculate: rust pattern ➔ harmonic calculation ➔ whistle note ➔ crack blooming into portal. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the gate does not break, it translates its own rust into a luminous arch, reweighting the city’s prison into a threshold. The single-scene window is anchored by sun angle and shell-shadow within 50 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the whistle and the crack together determine every subsequent tactic; failure would foreclose the only path to the Watchers.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the station shifts from tomb to sanctuary once the letter’s truth is voiced; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—ivy density and historical parallels reweight meaning rather than cause external change; cost is legible in the final image of “lighter satchel, clearer conscience,” satisfying the 9+ quick test; orientation is swift and the single shard holds.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he caps the inkwell, forecloses further inscription, and accepts the lake’s reclamation—cost is the unseen future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each note layers absence into witness until the cadence shift (“You are remembered”) reweights the stone library. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: blackout → silence → hypothesis → stamp test → palimpsest reveal → deliberate counter-impression. Each because/therefore linkage narrows her options until the final act of reclamation is the only ethical path left. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s “reclaimed stillness” is re-weighted from passive hush to active witness, and the glowing dual stamp carries permanent conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens ambiguity at any point.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last crane reframes all prior sorrow without erasing it, cost felt in the single tear. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of descent/ascent, polish/fold, gem/light—tightening until the final silver glint reweights the stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift. No causal breaks, no loops; the basilica’s fragility becomes the perfect physicalization of earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each reiterated image (geode, Earth below, circuit hum) tightens density until the “silent ocean” of pooled potential reweights every prior loss. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the future becomes “a canvas alive with echoes” — conceptual cost undeniable, no options reset. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“floating observatory’s cold steel”) inside 50 words; waiver applies. No causal turns required under this lens; pattern is taught early (“minute disturbances”) and paid off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the pools will keep whispering every time breakers cool—she now carries that antenna inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: drone triangulation → stone shift → orrery ignition → shared gaze. The reveal of the hollow beneath the flagstone is a decisive physical change that reconfigures both the quest and Kael’s interior void. Cost is legible in the humming floor and his tremoring hands—belonging is no longer abstract. Minor waver: Elara’s arrival is slightly convenient, not causally seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s decision to speak at dawn forecloses the path of continued erasure and carries undeniable relational cost. Causal chain holds—driftwood find → recovered memory → renunciation—tightened under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleported props. One softness: the “suppressed letter” is introduced retrospectively, a mild retroactive patch that keeps the score from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the drawer pull is reweighted from failure-token to insight-key under the waning crescent, cost felt in the line “a lighter, steadier burden.” Causal lens holds—every beat either tightens protocol or softens memory because of Veridian. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (parapet, storm, neutral hour); no penalty. One minor looseness: moon-phase signal is declared philosophical but never shown constraining either side’s tactics mid-scene; still, the final image reuses it, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because he miscalc’d once, therefore earthbound pole-counting; because poles vanish, therefore sky-gravity returns. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the compass re-anchored, humility re-priced—crystallized in the image of the needle “a tiny altar.” Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of self-punishment and embraces the very instrument that once betrayed him. Orientation locked by line 3; no telegraphing of the compass re-acceptance until the wipe-dew beat, keeping torque.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each newspaper clue → tunnel fork → narrowing options; closure lands with Decisive Change (lake gifts felt empathy) and visible cost (baseball forfeited, tears wash numbness), satisfying high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: two saplings intertwined reconfigure the entire mythos of love and death under an eternal moon. The Accumulative lens holds: each image—cookie fortune dissolving, spice-mist thickening into constellations—adds density until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is lyric but legible: because she surrenders her gift, the orchard re-roots her and Kael together. Cost is visible in the fortune’s dissolution and the beasts’ retreat—she loses her mortal shape and her coterie of creatures in one silent sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the crack is re-valued from breach to vessel (Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost—she forsakes control. Accumulative lens holds; each image (traced hand, cracked saucer) layers until the final tear re-weights them. One soft causality gap: how the saucer-crack physically “pinged” at the birth is asserted, not sourced, but it doesn’t rupture the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam opens, rain-scent and child-laughter spill out, and the cost—she is forever the only bridge—is legible in the same image. Causal chain holds: tear → integrated self → massless contact → lock yields. One soft spot: “ancient texts” is a late, off-stage catalyst; luckily the physical method (photograph shimmer) is already grounded, so causality only wavers, not breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the volcano’s hush and her emptied hands reweight prior light/memory motifs with undeniable conceptual cost; causal chain is thin (release → legend fulfilled) but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break of glowing ascent against black sand crystallizes the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is impeccable: blackout → descent → gnomon adjustment → flare → answer pulse. Each beat tightens options and ends with the earned CR image “a silent dawn had already begun to stir,” charging the whole fort with conceptual cost. The blackout-as-canvas rule is taught early and pays off in the final line, satisfying the lens test.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored friction circle reweights the world’s rules and her purpose under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: star-dust → spiral → hum → grit, each step tethered to prior image. The 120-word anchor is met: “tidal bluff… aurora… magnetic boots” situates who-where-when. Cost is legible in the dimmed aurora and lighter pouch; no late rule changes or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the darkroom timer’s soft chime crystallizes the vigil’s meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens—seconds become “sacred space between silence and song.” Cost is legible in the same line: the old mask (“furiously tranquil”) is gone, replaced by storm-washed peace that still requires descent into a censoring world. Causality is clean: every beat of lyric reflection is anchored to a concrete present cue (lightning, brittle timetable, timer tick) that tightens the pattern until the final image reweights it. No orientation debt; the observatory, storm, and exile are anchored by sentence three.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each needle alignment thickens pattern until the phrase crystallizes, a clean CR. Anchors land by line 5; orientation never wavers. Single tightening beat at needle #7 → “confluence” re-weights the stake; cost is conceptual—tomorrow’s vulnerability of open-handed collaboration. No因果 breaks; wind micro-turn integrates as data, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted seed crystallizes the “luminous fracture” rule—beauty through brokenness—with felt cost (Silas dissolved). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (library memory, courtyard work, moonlight mosaic) deepens the stake until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (memory block) is taught early and repaid at closure. Persistent constraint—monthly molt—shapes tactics and is accepted, not solved.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the minute’s restoration reweights time’s rule-set with undeniable cost. Causal chain (film cipher → sonic key → arbor → clock shift) holds; only the arbor’s准入 logic is asserted, not tested, keeping it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (silver-veined blossoms, reversed starlight river) layers density until the ridge itself becomes conscious. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—rain no longer erases but amplifies memory, reweighting the world-rule. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost crystallized in the final line: “luminous and doubting” forever—an ongoing price, not a fait accompli.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: cerulean regret reweights memory rules without sentimental absolution, and the cost (permanent carriage of sorrow-as-color) is legible in the final whisper. Accumulative lens holds: lace breathing, compass stillness, and juniper guidance each tighten the same stake—how to hold loss. No causal break; every image accrues until the color names the price. Docked 0.3 because the severance backstory is told, not tested, so the before/after delta is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where incremental dust patterns reweight Aris’s understanding of decay. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “meaning accumulates quietly, like dust on a leaf,” which redefines his life’s work and emotional stance. Cost is legible in his renunciation of equations for sketches and his acceptance of grief as continuity. The greenhouse’s evolving state—moss, spiderwebs, ash—provides coherent, tactile escalation that tightens his epistemological stance without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara redefines her art’s purpose, foreclosing escape in favor of testimony, with cost felt in her scarred body and lost studio. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory layering (smoke, frost, charcoal dust) until the frost patterns catalyze meaning. Orientation is immediate: “cold sandstone,” “stars,” “smoke in lungs” anchor who, where, when by line 3.
