  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the journey retraces a ledger's route, gathers fragments (ledger, frost map, hidden kiln, mentor's glass), and culminates in a new artwork that embodies the assembled meaning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—creating "Scorched Testament" and distributing it as both orientation and warning—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the artist reclaims purpose through the chamber's long inhale). Cost is conceptual (the piece names the fire's origin and accepts the risk of continued exposure) but felt cost is thin; no on-page dramatization of what the artist forfeits or fears by making this public. The Accumulative lens holds, but the ending summarizes outcomes ("those who needed to cross could hold it") rather than showing a single charged image where stakes crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: post-silence world, conservatory setting, narrator's survival vow. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered image (tuning forks, frost notation, heat-mapping) and the final movement—writing the capsize piece, Sura's question, the affirming gaze through winterglass—reconfigures the opening vow into lived practice with visible cost (endurance, industry, the choice to keep watch). The conceptual repricing is undeniable: "music is a verb...we are finally doing it right" charges prior material without moralizing. One substantive deepening suffices at this length; the cost is felt in the sustained labor and the fisherman's silent recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker assigns addresses to the drowned, the lens mends, and the city now holds his address "written in water and stone." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (lens, Morse, library catalog) and the final cadence shift ("I wanted...and now the city has mine too") reweights the opening stake with conceptual cost (permanent reciprocal binding). The orientation anchors arrive early (shop, package, coordinates, skiff, underwater library). One meaningful deepening occurs when the undertaker wedges into the seam and the messages find shelves. Cost is legible: his name is now written into the water-and-stone ledger, a permanent address he cannot leave. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through the sanctions backdrop, the bell's shifting contents, and the food-run choreography. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the community persists with the anonymity rule intact, and "our quiet amplified across the ridge like weather" reweights the opening arbor scene. Cost is felt in the persistence itself—"sanctions stayed, but so did we"—though the price could be more visceral. Orientation is solid; the pattern is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, ritual structure early and maintains it through to closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure image—"We will heal by revealing through breathing changes, by letting love move until it is used as light"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (thematic crystallization), but the cost is asserted through metaphor rather than dramatized as a foreclosed option or a visible sacrifice. The story deepens through accumulation of imagery (breath, aperture, unused love pooling in ribs) and one meaningful tightening when the friend and narrator sync breath to stabilize the image, but no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a live path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (nursery beds, frost lace, ghostly willow) and the closure reconfigures meaning when the halo shard disintegrates into the cambium and the photographs clear to "unmarked snow." The protagonist's agency (prying the fragment, setting it on cambium, speaking the vow) drives the final reconfiguration with visible cost (loss of photographic memory, dust hum). Orientation anchors are delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after "living bridge garden" and "hedge maze designer"—but the pattern is taught and the effect functional. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment is freed and retrocognition floods the garden, narrowing the protagonist's options to a single ritual path; the closure lands with felt cost (photographs blanch, fragment disintegrates, echo remains).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening line (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density and sensory particulars toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist reframes the Collectors' mission by offering packets and climbing together. Cost is legible—she binds herself to the bench, forecloses escape, and accepts complicity with former antagonists. The final image reweights the dominant stake (planting resilience vs. archiving) with felt conceptual cost, though the shift from confrontation to collective action arrives quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist confronts the father, registers the "faultline" via the hearing aid, and accepts the truth ("held that truth and set the orchard to grow"). The lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered images (forge, organoids, wrecks, aurora) that converge at the ending. Cost is felt but oblique—holding the truth implies emotional resolution, yet the on-page price (what is forfeited or altered by this acceptance) remains understated. Causality is consistent; the device's training and the father's presence are both well-seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (emerald station, moonlight, narrator's role) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator stays and releases light rather than capturing a portrait), but the cost is asserted ("carrying away nothing but relieved light") rather than dramatized—no tangible loss or foreclosed path is shown on the page. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens (moonbeams, flower codes, reflections layering toward the ending), but causality blurs: the man's decision to miss the train hinges on a future memory of the narrator's past act, a temporal loop that obscures who drives the turn. The final image reweights "thief" into "keeper," a valid RR, yet the felt cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens through drip-timed beats and repeated turns with the bookmark, lamp, and bells. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis (continuing the work despite conditions) with quiet cost implied in the phrase "patient as a tide pool, brave as a breath." The cost, however, remains oblique—no on-page line names a specific forfeiture, social price, or visible renunciation; the final image reconfigures tone but not options. Under the accumulative lens, the piece coheres, but the cost proof test shows only implied persistence rather than legible sacrifice, capping Q2 at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (rusted library, night, post-discovery timeframe) land by line two. The accumulative lens holds: smudged cast → microfilm → projection → floor trap form a causal chain, and the closure image (sitting among stacks, watching film "reflower") offers Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("ruin is another name for an honest beginning"). The drive tightens from discovery through decryption to confrontation. However, the floor-trap resolution introduces a convenience not seeded—chalked tiles and rotted boards appear only when needed, weakening the earned quality of the final image and nudging this below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors early (ridge fort, storm, scribe at charts, one remaining star). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through the oracle's arrival, the gold booklet's shedding flakes, and the scribe's evolving map notation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the map weighted with cannonballs and bread, the star lowering, the booklet emptied. Felt cost is present but muted: the night gains "rooms" rather than an escape, and the collaborative naming forecloses the scribe's initial insistence on edges. The closure image reweights prior material (silence as first shore, pauses as harbors) but the cost to the scribe personally—what specific path or stance is lost—remains atmospheric rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens inferred: the loops teach a pattern of density increase and cadence shift that reweights the protagonist's question. Orientation anchors (frozen courtyard, twilight, post-procedure) land early. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the puddle-comma permission and the final broom stroke reconfigure the dominant stake (finding thought's origin) with conceptual cost: stewardship replaces ownership, loops become questions rather than punishments. The violin's melt and comma-shaped remnant charge the final image with undeniable pressure, making before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (night registrar), where (museum forecourt), and the premise (after words unnecessary) within opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through doodles → lens revelation → public display, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when both curator and narrator surrender secrecy with visible cost ("Rell slid his pass onto the stone...traced a line from replica to real"). Cost is legible: Rell's pass-down and the narrator's logged confession alter their professional futures. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of ritualized attention (marble placement, ceremonial gratitude) that reweights the dominant stake (garden recognition) through density increase and cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (garden maze, withered vine dresser, measurable luck). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the doorway, the burning marble, and the garden exhaling together crystallizes the proof of mutual recognition with felt cost (humility, labor, years). One tightening occurs when the Auditor's meters confirm new roots around the markers, validating the "mended deception" and narrowing interpretive options. Cost is legible in the line "I do not smile, because I have learned humility when plants choose their company" and the physical labor of polishing and placement across seasons. No causality breaks; the reflective mode (~40% of text) anchors concretely in present marbles, vines, and the Auditor's visit, meeting BRR expanded allowance without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through the magnetic nexus experiment, layering sensory detail and reaching a peak when the flock's dreams translate time laterally. Orientation anchors (research station, Hale, Sera, aviary) arrive promptly. The closure—Hale logging the run, leaving a heat pack, thanking the flock—reconfigures meaning through cadence shift and the image of "ordinary night" settling back, suggesting Earned Stasis. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no on-page forfeiture or change in options is legible. The story teaches its pattern but the closure unit lacks the undeniable pressure or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the musician accepts the ghost's wordless collaboration and the impossible knowledge it confers, foreclosing rational explanation. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (water, lanterns, stains) and pattern (the ghost's prior rumor, tonight's images, the final silence)—and holds through the ending's resonant image of tuning "in between spaces." Causality is clean: the program's code prompts the disruptive note, which triggers evacuation before the bracket cracks. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist shifts from passive listener to active interpreter. The cost is conceptual and relational: tomorrow they "pretend nothing spoke to us," a chosen silence that isolates the protagonist's knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator speaks the warning now, reads the instrument roll call, and re-anchors the illustration with the uncovered number—a stance crystallization that forecloses future silence with visible cost (curses, donor optics, personal exposure). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fever-break recovery, oracle clicks, graphite-lifting, and auroral reprise accumulate into the broadcast moment. Orientation anchors (mountain station, post-fever, console) arrive within the first three paragraphs. Causality is tight: swallowed truth (silence during the wedding convoy) → fever dream → oracle query → graphite reveal → broadcast decision.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the narrator retrieves physical proof (tag, ledger) that reweights the mother's confession and his own life, and carries it forward with the tag "in my cheek like a coin"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (the truth's weight, the years bent sideways). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through mapped whispers, beaded tokens, and layered sensory detail until the ledger's "column of zeros where a life should be written" reweights all prior material. Orientation is swift (tunnel, mother's confession, narrator alone) and causality is motivated by months of mapping and the mother's paid silence. One small coherence slip: "Factory ghost shift was the phrase that rode the cold air" arrives as established lore but the narrator's prior mapping method (talk-radio psychics) isn't dramatized on the page, only summarized, creating minor causal distance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, accretive pattern early (vines, stone arches, crumbling peace) and deepens through recurring images (swan, refuge, regenerative silence). Orientation anchors promptly (overgrown library, catacombs). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final paragraph crystallizes the keeper's deepened task ("from writing to tending") and reweights "crumbling peace" as a patient, future-bearing posture. Cost is conceptual and felt—the keeper's hands "learn to balance" with a buckling world—though the image is slightly diffuse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vaults thrum and the keeper chooses to wait, letting transformation arrive on its own time.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by line 5. The eclipse functions as both structural frame and accumulative pressure device; the bowl-singing/Felix-tapping exchange deepens incrementally, culminating in Felix singing "mama" during totality—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the word, tears held "like stars at dawn," and the eclipse's return to light reweight prior silence with undeniable felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when Felix moves from heel-tap to touching the curl to the bowl, narrowing his resistance. Cost is visible: Lena's held tears, the plan for "simple steps," and Felix's "path we could trace later" all signal ongoing work rather than a cure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered acts of listening, reading fragments, and decoding dragons until the final inscription reconfigures the historian's task from collection to release. Orientation anchors (silo, historian, post-dream timeframe) appear early. The closure—writing so "the walls could rest and the world regain its ear"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the historian's stance crystallizes from probe to scribe) with conceptual cost legible in the image of restored listening. One weakness: the middle third loops similar perceptual beats (grain dust, wind, echoes) without a clear tightening or narrative turn that narrows options before the final writing act.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mei seeds fortunes → lighthouse gathering → dot-message reveal → shared exhale. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (lighthouse, island, after last orders). However, the closure lacks felt cost: the "open secrets" are affirmed without consequence, and no option is visibly foreclosed. The final image (folding the booklet, staying until the wick dies) reweights atmosphere but not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph ("chapel under Saint Umber," "Father Ruan," "dusk"). Pressure accumulates through layered loops and questions that tighten around the entity's core paradox until "If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow" forces the loosening. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the possession does not complete; the entity recognizes its hunger as a door and loosens) with felt cost visible in the palette thinning "to water" and the entity's faltering. One meaningful deepening: the final question reweights all prior material and completes the exorcism through grammar rather than force.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory and metaphoric density builds through the climb, with cadence shifts marking each landing. Orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, dawn) arrive early. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—"hold them with my hands until they learn to hold me back"—reweights the conductor metaphor with reciprocal containment, and the cost (exhaustion approaching, silence held in tension) is felt. One meaningful deepening through the climb suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (viaduct, rain, Lio's floating ability, tablet). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring images (arches, rain, lamp's "darkening brightness") and a pattern of reflect-rotate-invert that culminates in the protagonist's decision to fall and accept gravity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to arrival): Lio releases resistance, the arches "stitched themselves," and he walks home grounded with visible cost (loss of defiance, acceptance of mortality). One meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses the "staircase with the weakest echo" and later decides to fall, narrowing options under the tablet's procedural rules. Minor issue: the guard and alternate-self encounters read more as symbolic stations than causal pressure points, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear spatial anchoring (cavern, filament, drum) and a coherent arc from numbness to tentative feeling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (students "leaned forward... faces opened"), reweighting Lena's teaching stance with visible cost (she must now embody vulnerability). However, the middle section loops through similar gestures—hands on drum, vibrations as metaphor—without a decisive narrowing of options or a moment where Lena risks something concrete. The cassette's backward songs and the needle-as-stylus create texture but don't force a choice that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure (the quarantine zone and follower converge to test the narrator's stance). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator commits to the unowned report, crystallizing options with felt cost ("keep the report unowned even if it costs comfort"). The pigeon's return and the simple plan with the follower deepen stakes without requiring a causal reversal, consistent with the textural mode. Minor cost ambiguity: the vow names future discomfort but does not demonstrate immediate forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece teaches its pattern early—poetic compression, recursion of images (rope, whale, knots)—and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's choice to "braid it thinner" and feed the rope through the whale creates a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (discovering time's texture) with felt cost ("without it, I will travel blind"). The cost is legible in "the rope keeps its bright fatigue" and the escapee's release, though the mechanics of how the poem and rope together thin the second remain oblique. One meaningful deepening is present; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through gathering voices, rekindled ritual, and the recovered bell, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the hush "learns to listen" rather than vanishing. Orientation anchors—Mara, the cove, post-burn timeframe—arrive early. The closure image ("the sea holds quiet but not empty") reweights the premise with conceptual cost: silence becomes a shared breathing space rather than erasure. One meaningful deepening (fire → storytelling → bell recovery → collective sound) tightens stakes under the chosen lens, and the cost is felt in the compromise with imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory metaphors, the grotto's hum matching Liora's pulse, and the final image of "leftover possibilities" reweights the dealer's ongoing cycle. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora gains enough courage to continue her work without "embalming herself," and the dealer accepts the transient nature of their craft with visible cost (the petal archived, the grotto dimming, the dealer left "uncarved again"). Cost is legible in the final paragraph's image of dissipating charges and the dealer's solitary stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (docks → library → tuner backstory → group assembly) with legible transitions. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ledger becomes a living archive, "each thank you encouraging another like tide and moon"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The final image reweights prior material yet the felt price stays implied rather than dramatized, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive final act; the search for the sigil accumulates sensory and social pressure until the protagonist dedicates the bench, crystallizing the belonging-stake with cost. The sigil's discovery and the bench's placement form a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's vow is translated into labor and community acceptance. Orientation is anchored early (crystalline orchard, crater, marsh-reed sculptor). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the search intensifies kinship webs, and the dedication forecloses the protagonist's prior anonymity. Cost is legible: "I felt held like light is held by water until someone drinks" reweights solitude into interdependence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through pendant use, sluice manipulation, and echo birth, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the protagonist releases the echo despite guild presence—a renunciation that forecloses ownership with visible cost ("I let the echo go"). Orientation anchors quickly (illustrator, rooftop canals, giant beneath). The watcher's arrival and nod provide a micro turn that crystallizes the stakes without undermining the choice. One meaningful deepening is present: the echo's birth reweights the city's rhythm and the protagonist's relationship to both guild and giant.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates particulars (drips, reflections, equations, the mosaic stone) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist accepts continuity with the unfinished as "scaffold" rather than solution, a stance crystallized with visible cost (the apprentice remains refraction, not body). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines. The one meaningful deepening occurs when the stalactites slow and the refracted figure appears, reweighting the protagonist's practice from search into sustained co-presence. Cost is legible: the protagonist must hold grief as ongoing practice, not resolved proof.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory layers and motifs (sapphire hush, pipe chases, sense memory) that converge at closure when the narrator becomes visible and Mara's father's voice is recovered. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator's visibility is crystallized, Mara listens with the library, and the lamps steady—a palpable reweighting of the opening hush with conceptual cost (the narrator's secrecy is sacrificed). Orientation is established early (dawn, library, crawl space dweller, outage). One meaningful deepening: the discovery of the tape fragment leads to the decision to cache it and finally reveal oneself. Cost is legible in the narrator's shift from hidden to "visible enough."

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (nursery owner, storm season, mossy trellis). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring leaf observations, small reconstructions, and weather events that reweight the protagonist's stance from mastery to stewardship. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): "I will say the linden leaf changed me, and the storms, and the willingness to let change be" crystallizes the shift with conceptual cost (forfeiture of certainty, ledger set aside). The gale scene provides a micro-turn that validates the new approach, and the final image of "vines choosing threads like careful readers" charges prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within opening lines (tidal island, post-war shore, insomniac painter). The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural teaching the land to follow rain becomes a collective tool, reweighting the protagonist's solitary hunger into communal work with visible cost (scaffolding time, children and elders embodying the effort). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through rain trails → map → mural with the final image charging prior material. One tightening occurs when the brooch's alignment opens the cistern, narrowing options from scattered search to focused excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of "everyday magic" magnification builds through cave pearl → organ nest → vowel hum → shadow inhabitance, each deepening the resonance until the final act (inviting the shadow into the syllable) reconfigures the premise with felt cost: the vowel "deepens, not heavier, but kinder." Orientation anchors by ~80 words (pilgrim arrives, clairvoyant guide, musical cave). One meaningful tightening occurs when the listening shadow requests a home, narrowing options to accept or refuse. Cost is legible: the shadow becomes "resident instead of rumor," altering the vowel's weight. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the transformed relationship between sound, shadow, and everyday objects with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the archivist refuses to blow the trumpet, instead waiting for children's laughter, and the final image reconfigures the harbor's breath as permission rather than command. Conceptual cost is legible—the old herald's sacrifice is honored by choosing listening over signal. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered motifs (valve, breath, intervals, spray) and the ending reweights silence as "not the trumpet, but the breath." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (ivory harbor, after rain, archivist role).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines; the two-shard structure (boulevard → railyard vault) is taught and legible. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist watches passengers walk their sentences through doors, achieving Earned Stasis by keeping "the hour's appointment"), and cost is felt: the protagonist has offered hidden truths and drawn maps of previously avoided paths. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence build through the vault sequence, reweighting the dominant stake (finding the fortress and confronting unspoken truths). However, the causal link between clicking the punch and the fortress opening feels ceremonial rather than mechanically motivated, and the protagonist's agency in the vault is more observational than decisional, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds through layered images (whales, tile, tower corridors) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chamber becomes a memorial space that can "hold truth." Closure cost is present—Lio plants his anger alongside laughter, narrator sacrifices their guilt—and the magic square's mechanics provide constraint. Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (tower, whale migration, tile). One deduction: the middle escalation relies on metaphorical description ("corridors of faint starlight") rather than dramatized choice-points, slightly softening causal pressure even under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost: the protagonist sheds immortality by transferring the cursed fragment to Mara, and the final image—"goodbye answered by becoming arrival"—reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (coils, auroras, magnetic fields) and a cadence shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who (immortal narrator), where (prismatic escondite beneath polar glass), and when (during a solar storm) within the first ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara pulls the twin metal and the fragment shifts allegiance, narrowing the protagonist's options and enabling the final passage.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by line 3. The escalation tightens through because/therefore linkage: Yusef taps → narrator rolls → officers confront → habit-performance buys passage → transfer completes → names exchanged. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: "breath for truth, risk balanced by use" reweights the premise via the exchange structure, and the cost is legible in the threat paid and the mothers' future action enabled. One meaningful deepening (the fair-trade calculus) reshapes stakes without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the daily ritual of charting lamp variations and binding invented histories accumulates density and recurrence. Orientation anchors (mountaintop kiosk, bonsai maze, post-silence) arrive cleanly within the first third. However, closure reads as deferral—"Until then I continue"—rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the protagonist's stance does not visibly foreclose a path or reweight prior material, and the cost of staying remains asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered fragments early and maintains it; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to shared practice) when the protagonist teaches the woman to "build our own ears from rust," reweighting solitary collection into collaborative witness with visible cost—the protagonist surrenders uniqueness. Orientation anchors (nameless narrator, container labyrinth, port city) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison-bottle label connects to the woman's father's death, tightening personal and systemic erasure into a single thread. Cost is legible on the page in the final lines: "returning what it gathered" forecloses the prior stance of hoarding fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (abandoned observatory, dusk, cliff) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (seashell, cello, chalk, painted stars) that converge at closure when the narrator aligns the shell's stars to the dome crack and speaks the apology. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights the riddle from "what binds everything" to "how we remain unbound without floating away," and the cost is conceptual (forgiving alters the past "just enough"). Causality is loose but patterned; the hum-method enables the astronomer conversation, which then prompts the kitchen-table memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass "settled…back, toward a memory I had avoided," narrowing the narrator's stance. The lens holds, but the abundance of metaphoric restatements in the middle third creates mild drift before the ending tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (the chip, the graffiti code, the parade reroute) that converge at the ending when the narrator stands "between Yano and Miri, my dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the city "not triumphant, but not conquered either"—and the cost is legible in the developers' grumbling and the muted collective hum. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (raft city, carnival, privatization week). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator's painted herons shift both factions' tactics, and the final image of tucking the chip under the tongue charges the reconfiguration with ritual weight. The lens holds without contradiction, and the ending reweights the dual role with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator photographs the last unbranded dawn, then stops winding the camera with visible cost ("there will be no second last"), and the final image—the stone remembering impacts "without caring who paid for the light"—reweights the premise with felt loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through layered images (pennants, vial, sand grain, film) and held through the ending, which charges prior material via the mentor's message and the logos arriving. One tightening occurs when the mirrors bloom and the narrator must act immediately. Cost is legible on the page: the world has changed, the moment cannot be repeated, and the narrator carries proof "curled in the dark of my pocket."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4 (Mara, depot, blindness). The closure crystallizes her role as listening steward when the anchor rises, reweighting prior sensory particulars with calm authority. Cost is conceptual (sustained attention under time pressure) but legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the drone returns damaged and she decodes its feedback under the ship's deadline, narrowing the window and raising stakes modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (frost, condensation, falcon return, ice opening) that converge into a final Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist validates discovery and returns to the outpost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ice pupil exhales and the protagonist tastes the water, reweighting the entire expedition's stake. Cost is present—"cold edits our bones," the bargain with stillness, the isolation—but somewhat oblique and atmospheric rather than a stark forfeiture. The two-shard structure (outpost → ice → outpost) holds within one contiguous window with clear transitions, meeting Track B tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: footsteps layer until the archway "drinks the pattern" and stones respond. Orientation is delayed—who the narrator is, why they arrived, and what specific question drove them remains vague past the opening third, costing ~−0.4. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator inherits the tuner's listening role), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture or altered relationship. The final image reweights the opening hush, yet the narrator's agency remains observational throughout, weakening the sense of a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (signal, hush, vial) build toward a final image that reweights the opening coordinates into song. Closure arrives on the page with visible cost ("turn down my oxygen," choosing to stay still while the wave passes) and a Resonant Reconfiguration—the distress signal becomes an offering. Orientation anchors clearly (underwater temple, diver alone) and the tightening from snagged net to altar discovery to transmission is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (lattice, beam, hush, scuffs) build density and the final stanza reweights the opening inheritance motif with a cadence shift. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator commits to "work and quiet, not wolves"—but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture. Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, lantern room, pantry) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice divides light and "the hush bent," revealing its appetite, though the mechanics of rescue ("opened nothing; I only kept the beam steady") stay oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (greenhouse, narrator, watch-keeping). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the bead's escalating function (touching glass → singing → teaching → pressing into palm) and the orchard's responses accumulate pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator commits to perpetual tending with the cost felt in "fear of failing her twice" and the endless cycle of "paying." The causal thread from bead to confession to awakening holds, though the debt-repayment mechanism itself remains more asserted than dramatized in a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric/mosaic exposition interleaved with action beats) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the rough book and tactile lighthouse reweight the labyrinth's purpose from archival rigidity to participatory reverence, with the conceptual cost legible in "the only rule was listening" and the broken precedents becoming instruments. Orientation anchors (wharf, canyon labyrinth, protagonist role) arrive clearly within the first ~150 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the plate "fits the niche like a fossil returning to its bone," opening the seam and transforming the task from delivery to co-creation, which then charges the final image of the town touching blind pages.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (roots threading skulls, dial shadow traveling like blessing) that reweight the dominant stake of restoring faith and temporal connection. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraphs. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the sundial holding moonlight and "time stepped over the threshold we rebuilt for it" crystallizes the protagonist's shift from passive longing to active continuity-maker with felt cost (the renunciation of detached observation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the gnomon clicks into place and "time climb[s] out of the soil," altering the narrator's relation to the dead and the living. Minor cost-legibility issue: the exact trade-off or foreclosed path could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through layered detail about margins, chalk codes, and the pseudonym creation process, culminating in a Charged Poise moment where the narrator holds the letter before mailing, crystallizing the stakes of naming and transit with felt cost ("promise the edges that we will find the right name at last"). The dominant lens holds cleanly; the final image reweights the marginal space that has accumulated meaning throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Tamsin alters the flame and bells, delaying but not stopping the coup, accepting "futures stitched" as her best outcome. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through pattern (listening → stitching → testing possibilities → altering the flame), culminating in a cadence shift where her act reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when she breathes on the flame and the gears "did not synchronize," narrowing conspirators' options. The cost is legible: "its certainty would fray," and she prepares escape routes knowing torches will run. No causality breaks; the stitched map, synchronized orrery, and flame mechanics cohere under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to situational confrontation) and holds it through closure. The orientation is clear by the opening beat: protagonist, mangrove labyrinth, present tense of seeking. The closure—staying instead of smoking, hand reaching—lands on the page as Earned Stasis with felt cost (the "break in me begins to stitch"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the medium evokes the hospital moment and the protagonist must witness rather than revise. Minor loop phrasing ("I am here to find the moment before deciding" appears twice) slightly dulls momentum but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is on-page and legible: the translator's decryption of the cast notes leads to a negotiated solution ("hand him to the auntie at the jetty at sunrise") with visible cost—selective withholding of truths. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered notes, coral grooves, family proverbs, and the brain-coral fragment accumulate meaning until the final image reweights the premise of translation as "a graft, and the graft holds because it drinks from both roots." Orientation anchors who (translator), where (hospital atrium), and when (twilight/after anesthetic) clearly. One causal tightening occurs when the translator realizes the notes "map, and they plead," shifting the task from passive observation to active mediation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mosaic structure taught early (daydream fold, orchard opening "like a bruised pear"). The piece coheres through density increase and cadence modulation rather than causal linkage. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator rewinding the film, writing a promise and recipe on the leader, and acknowledging "joy…is happiest when exposed, shared…left on a tree for someone else to see" reweights the dominant stake (rediscovering vs. hoarding joy) with conceptual cost legible in the act of release. Orientation anchors (vivid mural artist, ruined orchard, fog) appear immediately. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reel stutters and the narrator tries juggling pears, then the grandmother winks across decades, shifting the stance from preservation to expenditure. The mosaic shard count (pre-display preparation, display itself, post-display departure, reflective return frame) stays within Track B allowance, transitions are signaled by time markers ("Tonight," "When morning sniffed"), and the lens holds. Cost is conceptual and felt (release of the film, leaving the fragment) rather than a decisive physical forfeiture, which keeps this out of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through echo-work, nested imagery, and the wall's "reply" that reweights the opening question. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist leaves the coin and departs knowing she will "be inside their listening, waking again"), crystallizing stance with conceptual cost—she trades singularity for perpetual recursion. Orientation is secure by line 3; the lens holds. The cost is legible but oblique, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accretes through planted message patterns and culminates when the collectors retreat, reweighting the dominant stake (evading taxation of thought). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the greenhouse opening; no penalty. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image (gourd seed in envelope labeled "Receipts") crystallizes the method and reconfigures the Bureau's ledger logic with conceptual cost (the collectors "realized the math just then"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the Notice of Arrears forces the group to draft a soil-based reply, narrowing tactics. However, the collectors' retreat hinges on their own epiphany rather than protagonist agency, diluting causal ownership of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (postcard → chalk circle → lullaby → voices → treaty draft) and the final cadence shift ("buds hold... open when the sun speaks") reweights the dominant stake (ending faction skirmishes). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the armistice is written, the shell "breathes," insomnia "loosens its fists"—a credible endurance that forecloses war without erasing cost. Orientation is solid by the second paragraph (who/where/when), and the two-shard structure (waking → Spiral Choir journey → negotiation) coheres within one window with one visible transition. Cost is present but muted: "no slashing for pride, no exile for color" articulates new rules, yet we don't witness a specific forfeiture on-page (a character giving up armor, a faction yielding territory). The final lines gesture toward ongoing work ("practice sleeping without closing," "joy is a reef with shadows"), which charges the image but stops short of making a decisive price undeniable in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (caretaker, opal library, above clouds). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (orchids, chime, names, rooms) and culminates in a cadence shift when Aristea's name is whispered into the orchid, the mezzanine reveals itself, and new rooms are assembled. The final winding of the chime offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options crystallize as she commits to collecting what is "lost but not surrendered"—but the cost remains more atmospheric than legible on the page; no concrete forfeiture or visible trade-off marks the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear who/where/when (arcane linguist, archive, present-tense return) and accumulates pressure through layered vows that unseal the door—a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("the language of we is a grammar I will not lose again"). The vow-by-vow structure functions as escalation under an accumulative lens, each promise reweighting trust and access. Minor causality softness: the door's mechanics ("symphonies of truth aligned within spoken promises") are asserted more than demonstrated, and the final codex appears as reward rather than complication, slightly diluting the cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered discovery (envelope → resin pattern → surveyor's chain → opening schedule), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gates function and the valley "learns how to listen." Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the lesson of encrypted care must be remembered, the method archived). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the resin sequence translates into the schedule, reweighting the quarrel from abstract dispute to embodied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ledger of safe returns and teaching balance represent a stance crystallization with felt cost—the narrator moves from isolated keeper of ghosts to someone who lends balance and maps harmony again. The accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through Ezra's arrival, the meteorite's anchoring function, the confession about Mara, and Thimble's return with a reply. Cost is visible in the confession itself and in the risk of reopening paper trails. Orientation is clear early (attic, pigeons, scale, meteorite). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator tells Ezra about Mara and Ezra "did not try to edit my ghosts"—this changes the narrator's willingness to act.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (architect's child), where (terrace/workshop), and when (after his vanishing) within the opening third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): crossing the threshold reweights the maze-letter and fog-departure into a legacy of necessary distances, with visible cost—the protagonist leaves the frame open, accepts the seams in the hush, and boards the drifting terrace alone. One meaningful deepening: the logbook-to-grain revelation narrows options from searching for the man to inheriting his method. Cost is legible in "stubborn with love" and the mended-but-seamed hush. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (landscape astrologer), where (underwater facility dome), and when (night to sunrise) by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered rituals (shared exhale, burnt feather tracings, plankton responses) rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist moves from vow to embodied belonging, with the mosaic dancers offering conceptual validation. The cost is subtle: the protagonist "stayed," forgoing the detachment implied by "until sunrise," but that price could be more viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and motifs through seed-constellations and transliterated glyphs, achieving a cadence shift at closure when the cave "winks" and leaves ribbons. However, the Orientation Test fails: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~15% in), and the narrative window remains hazy throughout. Cost is implied in the agreement with the bird but not made undeniable on the page; the protagonist's options do not visibly narrow. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap downstream.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The grid game crystallizes into a shared performance, and the woman's pocket-pocketing of the bishop offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options are legible, the cost is felt in her departure as "a diagonal absorbed by night," and the performer readies another beginning. Closure lands on the page. Orientation anchors arrive early (tidal arcade, night, performer, shells, props). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman steps into the grid and co-creates the pattern. The lens holds. Cost is visible in the woman's vanishing and the grid's dissolution, reweighting the premise of curated chance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure (Hybrid). The piece establishes who (dancer), where (twilight garden), and when (after ban) within the opening lines. The closure—teaching the watcher and opening "a harbor no law can close"—reads as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the transformed dynamic and reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs when the watcher asks "if forgetting can be gentle" and the dancer responds with action. The lens holds, though the lyric density occasionally obscures the causal chain between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: glazier, prism atrium, Pearl Bay dawn. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through pond ritual, glass repair, light demonstration, harbor master encounter—culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the master promises to bring the council and the glazier reads affirming pond rings. The cost is conceptual and felt: the atrium's survival remains uncertain ("plans could bend"), the glazier's method proven but not secured, living "the moment before everything shifts." One meaningful deepening occurs when light touches the ledger and the harbor master sees the net mender's name, reweighting his stance. The final image crystallizes options without yet paying the full price, meeting RR/Charged Poise standards.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when promptly (firefighter, ridge, moonlit night) and teaches a pattern of lyric compression early. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he leaves the box as compass, vows return, and commits to teach rookies—reweighting his guilt into forward action. Cost is legible in the box left behind and the vow's constraint on future seasons. One meaningful deepening (the confession to Mira, her response, the seed planting) tightens the dominant stake. The lens holds, but the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, and the middle section's repetitive reflection loops slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the grotto setting and parallel-timeline frame are taught early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through pattern refinement (shells → choirs, solo → collective exchanges) and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing—"hope equals attention multiplied by exchange"—that reweights the premise with social cost (weekly gatherings, traded failures). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: the protagonist names herself a variable and commits to ongoing communal work, forgoing solitary control. One meaningful deepening occurs when children's simultaneous song shifts the equation from "heights" to "simultaneous notes," altering tactics and opening the final sequence. Causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the parallel-timeline mechanic remains ornamental after setup, contributing atmosphere without constraining later choices.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage), and when (after climate shifts) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (film negative, grandmother's diaries, the man's knocking) that culminates in a cadence shift when the narrator "recharted the echo, letting the knocking become a lull." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with compassion): the corridor closes "like healed skin," forecloses the haunting, and the narrator commits to ongoing listening. Cost is felt in the conceptual burden transformed ("lighter when I carried it as listening, not law") and the physical act of humming until the montage dissolves. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens with strong atmospheric anchors (terrace, spring, post-storm) but defers clear causality: the painter arrives, performs a ritual, and leaves without a visible before/after that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The ending asserts transformation ("the people learned to hum the key again") via summary rather than dramatizing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration in the closure beat. Lens ambiguity persists—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density produces a legible tightening at closure. Cost is conceptual (the city's "glance now carried a seam of brightness") but remains abstract and told, not felt in a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ritualized gestures (water from both banks, steam, breath-clouds on ebony) accumulate pressure toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors cleanly within the first ~15% (ancient terrace, midsummer, negotiator role, two delegations). The closure unit—signing with breath-clouds, leaving the clipboard as seal—reconfigures the accord into shared witness with felt cost (the narrator's vow of silence if peace fails). One meaningful deepening occurs when the General names the ambush and the Matriarch her aunt's death, narrowing emotional terrain before the vow. Cost is legible: the reed as hinge and the public forfeiture of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors (salt flat, convoy, protagonist alone) land within the first 120 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through escalating specificity (manufactured drought → map → chamber → egg → hatch → echo → compromise decision) and a cadence shift at closure reweights the opening stake. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the protagonist writes a "narrower grace" (nightly releases, seeded bowls) that forecloses the drastic path with felt cost ("promises always imply a future where you must answer"). The final image—chick learning the chamber, thunder carrying the earlier song—reconfigures the opening's "first sound" with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. One persistent constraint (the ledger, the directors, the drought contracts) shapes every tactic and the final compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lira's ritual builds density through sensory accretion and symbolic unpinning until the prism sanctuary shifts from master to instrument. Orientation anchors (courtyard, snow, door) arrive early. The closure—echoes returning to owners, guild arriving too late, new hush that "no longer pressed but held"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallized, pressure undeniable). Cost is legible: the city's lullaby is unbraided, surveillance broken. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira untangles the "city's great braid" and feels it burn, narrowing her path. Minor causality ambiguity: how exactly the door opens (between sigh and smile) and why the guild cannot reverse the change remains somewhat abstract, but the pattern holds and closure delivers conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, the argument's residue, the stick's tactile history, and the final bar scene into a deepening that reweights the ethical stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Aurel's apology and the co-written rules foreclose his prior unilateral control with visible cost (humility, shared authority). Orientation is clean by the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the troupe returns and new rules are inscribed, narrowing Aurel's options and redistributing power.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening: narrator at grotto, dawn, monarch migration. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (moth wing, frames, butterfly arrival, knot-tying) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise when the monarch departs and the narrator collapses the frames, reweighting the signal's meaning without a decisive external event. Cost is conceptual and felt: the transience of the structure and the acknowledgment that "signals live only long enough to be believed." One meaningful deepening occurs when the monarch reads the frames and the narrator tilts the triangle to guide him east, crystallizing the purpose of the labor.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The opening establishes forgiveness-as-threshold; pressure builds through braided imagery (punched card → rope → organ) that converges at the moment the protagonist unlays the braid and feeds the card into the copper guide. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist stays to tend the bellows, forecloses wandering, with cost visible in "shoulders ached" and the commitment to "keep the bellows awake when storms came." Orientation anchors are present early (sanctum, aurora, ice). Cost is legible and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (dreams, directive fragments, storm approach) and culminates in a collective choice that reweights the central question. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the path "chose us as we chose it" crystallizes mutual election with felt cost (slowing, leaving room, collective seal-pressing). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the directive "decayed into invitation," transforming the premise and narrowing options toward partnership rather than solitary transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace observatory, twilight between regimes) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The accumulative-textural lens holds: the astronomer assembles schematic representations, aligns the tile, and the culminating gesture—touching the bronze eyelid—unlocks the passage and seals the covenant with visible cost (he reduces himself to "curves and sums" and pledges ongoing stewardship). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ash mirrors his diagrams and the ceiling river returns to stone, crystallizing his vow with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the palace "seemed to read him," tightening the reciprocal stake before the final ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: scheming pacifist; where: soundless sanctuary; when: during siege) arrive within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through the ritual with cellular memory, Mara's confession of names and reasons, and the final placement of the music box against her sternum. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—Mara's body "reintroduced her to the woman who had kissed her" and "resentment stepped back," with the war turning home as visible cost. One meaningful deepening through the stone-mapping ritual narrows options and reweights the siege.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, accretive pattern early (fog, frost, mirrors, breath) and accumulates density toward the closure image where the dream folds into the orchard and neighbors harvest reflections. Orientation anchors appear within the first ~100 words (ruined orchard, twilight frost, Iren at center). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dream "nosed closer" and "they inhaled together," the sextant now "pointed to warmth," and neighbors enter—the final image reweights the stake (capture vs. release) with felt cost (the sextant remains broken, the dream runs but returns). One meaningful deepening occurs when Iren "turned the mirrors outward" and unsealed the sextant's index as offering, shifting tactics and opening the way. Cost is legible in the sextant's persistent brokenness and the orchard's transformation that required the protagonist's patience and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered repair work, generational echoes, and the deciduous-vows frame, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the ribbon darkens and the leak "speaks." The closure image—teaching the leak its accent—reweights the opening breach with felt cost (the ribbon sacrificed, the guild contract abandoned for immediate care). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the breach/cathedral/orchard opener. The single-scene window with interleaved reflection holds coherent pressure and pays off the vows metaphor through the repair's visible compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (curator, asteroid orchard, contract-bound timeframe). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's alternative use of the cameo "loosens" the ledger and allows the orchard to bloom without trapping either heir, reweighting the inheritance stakes. Cost is conceptual and felt—choosing a "gentler grammar" forecloses the direct inheritance path—and the final image of seeds "small as commas" charges the resolution. One meaningful deepening (the bathroom realization → altered cameo use) fits the length; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric cadence shifts that reweight the quest. Causality holds through the rescue sequence: researching gaps → finding the traveler → editing silence via apology → door opens. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist renegotiates to retain access, accepts the aching palm imprint, and the traveler's small apology charges the final image with felt cost. One minor seam: the shift from "unheard symphony" guiding feet to footnote trap could be tighter in spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (carnival ship, fog, narrator alone) arrive early and hold. The piece accumulates pressure through spatial descent (gangplank → funhouse → ballroom → horticultural deck) and the gradual materialization of the twin, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "we told the worst part together, and the mirrors held instead of shattering." Cost is legible: speaking the suppressed trauma forecloses silence, and the garden "leaned closer, tipping seeds into our pockets" marks the reweighting. One substantive tightening—the barker's demand to "bring her, the twin you carry"—forces the protagonist to confront the split self. The ending sentence ("a map stitched inside") recharges the opening's "second history stitched inside," closing the pattern with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the archivist completes the repair, the door retires into brick, and the finding aid invites future witnesses—cost is conceptual (devotion to clarity over mystery) and social (opening access rather than hoarding). The accumulative lens holds: fables of absence gather density through treaty/bell/seal, then the rope-braid task reweights the premise by merging schedules into "a single honest ring." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph ("university clock tower mechanism room"), meeting the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist traces braid to file to wax-seal diagram, narrowing options to the rope task. Minor slip: the final image ("whoever finds it will have a way to begin") slightly dilutes the closure's sharpness by deflecting to future actors rather than crystallizing present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the cave mapped us, and we agreed to be found" crystallizes a shift from solitary task to collaborative attunement, with the cost legible in the measured waiting and the hush becoming portable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sensory particulars (ice drum, tuned darkness, frost-bitten thyme) and the final cadence shift ("weather that loved us") reweights the opening's "wild resonance" into "hammered repose." Causality within the accumulative frame holds: each beat (Throat Alcove tracings, corridor narrowing, ice drum convergence, tuning together) deepens the stake until readiness materializes. One persistent constraint (the echo chamber stone's warmth/cooling cycles) shapes tactics throughout and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, tool manipulation, and retrocognitive layering until the beacon lights and a flare answers. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kera replies to the flare, calling them home, and the final image reweights prior coincidences into purpose with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by ~120 words ("beacon-tower custodian," "years after collapse," "tower heart"). Cost is felt in the effort, the halted wheel, and the decision to expose her position. One minor slip: the beacon's first failure and restart could have landed with sharper consequence, but the ending's legible cost and coherent lens hold.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (observatory, fog-solidified premise, role by line two). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist gathers sensory data, tests a conjecture, and receives atmospheric confirmation that the "seam will hold." The closure—"identity can be sculpted from experience without breaking the vessel that holds us all"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise, though the cost (unbinding fear, setting joy beside it) is named rather than felt in specific forfeit. The lens holds, but the final affirmation lacks the tangible price or tightening that would elevate it to high-8s.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lio prepares, launches, and the town's despair lifts incrementally through patterned imagery (chanting, mosaic instructions, echo-answering-echo). Orientation anchors who/where/when early (fortress at dusk, Lio the designer, "children had started to count their breaths"). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—Lio and Mara walking the ramparts with "grave smiles" after the display—crystallizes their stance against despair, and the keeper's acknowledgment ("not one star had returned, but the faces below were bright") reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual and felt (no literal stars, only invented cousins of light), though the price is more implicit than vividly embodied in a single decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The grotto anchors who/where/when by line 1; the dominant stake (stay or leave the coast) is signaled at line 4 and accumulates pressure through sensory deepening and the cicada's evolving charge. Closure achieves Earned Stasis when the narrator refuses immediate decision but commits to shared crossing, forecloses the demand for resolution, and reweights the premise ("the will waits on a question spoken without the demand to end it"). Cost is felt in the refusal itself and the acceptance of sustained uncertainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cicada's symbolic weight shifts from "fossil of change" to active permission ("leaving is a form of arrival"), then pays off in the final image of the cicada sleeping, "content to wait."

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density and pattern (three pours of silence, each reweighted). Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist alloys bunker silence with gilded hush, and the trellis "approves" by sprouting new tendrils; the final descent reframes the ladder from "jail bars" to "rib cage widening." Cost is visible: the protagonist must taste the traumatic bunker note and endure panic to achieve integration. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "I have mistaken the metal for the cage," reweighting prior material. Orientation is clear early (evening gravity inversion, trellis above clouds, narrator's bunker origin).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (gondola operator, terrace, post-train quiet) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the storm-glass imagery and bell-counting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the mother exhales and the bell "sleeps in a pocket"—a reweighting of grief's noise into held silence. The cost is legible but muted: the mother's grief is eased, not transformed with a felt forfeiture. One meaningful deepening is present (the girl's counting bridge), satisfying the 600–800 word requirement, but the ending leans toward comfort without a sharp price that charges the final image with undeniable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (waterfall, orchard, murals, ruby flake) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration when Maris places her palm and "stewardship began." The cost is conceptual—accepting a responsibility rather than claiming dominance—and the final image reweights the throne premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the murals reveal ancestors who hesitated, shifting the throne from object to distributed responsibility. Closure lands on the page with felt cost, though the causality between individual beats (scanner → coordinates → root-room → stairway) relies more on accumulative mystery than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of linked images (ash, starlight, doorknocker, breath) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the visitor's departure "without a door" and the Keeper's solitary vigil. Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is established only through self-declaration ("Call me Keeper"), and the sanctuary's nature remains abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure image—ash accepting fewer footprints, silence becoming generous—reweights the dominant stake (teaching breath to the suffocating) with a felt cost (the Keeper remains alone, the loaded emptiness now "carries a pulse"). However, the cost is conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation makes the price unmistakable in a single pointed sentence. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks the sharp edge required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (mushroom farm, porthole bolt, quantum promise) and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing when the bead forms with visible cost ("a diamond that remembered every mouth that spoke"). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening: mushroom farm, pyramid-scheme survivor, present-tense tending. The closure reweights the premise (pressure without crushing) with conceptual cost legible in the final pledge to build "a network that is not a pyramid." One meaningful deepening occurs when volunteering shifts from metaphor to enacted transformation in the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the gramophone's standing waves unlock nested revelations (portrait seam, tin, photographic plate) that deepen the narrator's understanding of the dynasty's end. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the narrator reframes their role from "dynasty ender" to "willing listener," reweighting the premise with the cost of perpetual witness rather than reign. Orientation anchors (sepia reading room, evening, narrator alone with gramophone) are clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening: the discovery that both grandmother and father refused orders, making the abdication a shared sanctuary rather than solitary failure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the knight removes his armor, adopts a murmured oath, and commits to cultivating possibility with visible renunciation of his martial past. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through orchard imagery, the program's blueprint, mirror-pear reflections—culminating in a cadence shift where he becomes gardener rather than warrior. Cost is legible (armor discarded, old allegiance abandoned), though the final image of the hovering pear and his smile edges toward symbolic convenience rather than a sharp, irreversible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the archivist sends the package with "tactfully hopeful" uncertainty that reweights prior archival distance. Cost is felt in "I let the envelope go, and in the quiet afterward, the file room waits"—the character has acted beyond policy and now carries the unknowable outcome. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (dust patterns, gaps, the button's story accretes meaning through layered observation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the button transforms from object to gesture to return. The lens holds cleanly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors orientation (Jessa, lagoon, dusk) within the first third and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the relay, puddle-map, key, and auric lagoon recur and intensify until the final flare reweights the erased names with witness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lagoon mirroring the deleted faces constitutes undeniable social cost and reframes the State's revision project. The causality is loose (squads recover quickly, crowds arrive on cue), but under the Accumulative lens that is acceptable; the cost is legible in "breaking the squads with witness" and Jessa's renewed vow.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates fog, drip-code, and negative-space imagery toward a final reconfiguration where the prophecy "stutters" and the protagonist packs the horn, earning a resonant reprieve until next season (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise undertone). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening stanzas; the grotto setting and dawn timeframe are clear. One meaningful deepening occurs when the code "implicates me by name" and the protagonist counters with "absence," narrowing the prophecy's consonants into harmless bubbles. Cost is legible in the vesper-mark line ("work done when no one watched") and the commitment to return, foreclosing applause and ease. No causality breaks; the ritualistic structure fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through monument-building, the Moonstone triggers a shift, and the final release reconfigures the arbor's grammar. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: letting go forecloses hoarding), but the cost is more thematic assertion than felt price—no on-page moment shows what Fen loses by emptying his catalogues. Orientation is delayed but legible by ~150 words; the hush/prophecy frame provides temporal anchor. The lens holds, but cost proof is weak: "his catalogues were towers in his mind" is told, not shown collapsing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the tinkerer reopens the shop with charred beams as "ribs of memory" and practices willingness to adjust rather than certainty. Cost is visible in the doorbell that "refused to ring until the rain began" and clocks "wrong just long enough to be right"—operational friction that forecloses predictable repair work. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fire → sigil → greenhouse → cavern → machine repair → reopened shop, each beat adding density and cadence shift until the final image reweights "broken-clock tinkerer" from failure to method. One tightening occurs when the compass seats and "numbers I could not read warmed the walls," narrowing the protagonist's interpretive frame and forcing improvisation as permanent stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of metallurgical metaphor braided with memory, escalates through the kintsugi repair sequence, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final stanza: the alchemist commits to carrying forward despite knowing the father will hate them, with the cost made undeniable ("accept the hatred as another name with weight"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (foundry, alchemist, fire). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coin is hammered into the disc and the pattern becomes "a map of all the times we failed her," reweighting the premise from magical redemption to testimonial repair. Closure participation is strong and cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the laugh transforms from "fled from me" to "followed like a small river under my tongue," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator integrates laughter into healing by first offering vulnerability. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through spectral confessions, the crocodile's tooth plectrum, and the gorge's witness until the narrator's confession opens the seam. Cost is visible: "I quit apologizing for staying alive" and the bow at the rim. Orientation is swift (gorge, sunrise, harp by line 4). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory density, trauma-response beats, and the recurring pewter strap, culminating in a conceptual repricing when the protagonist articulates "mercy equals intention weighted by injury" and leaves the strap as a boundary condition. The closure reweights prior material with visible cost (relinquishment, walking toward "survivable" dark). Orientation anchors (ultraviolet forest, post-anesthesia) arrive early. One micro turn (discovering the strap, then reversing path) supports the dominant escalation without fragmenting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues density through repeated images (lens fragment, hidden details, anchors of intuition) and the final moment—hanging the painting as map and teaching the market to read its threads—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive by ~150 words (market, narrator with satchel and lens). However, the closure cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs on the page, only a declared intention to "keep the paths suspended." The causal chain is present but diffuse, relying on metaphor more than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). The protagonist discovers the hidden manipulation apparatus, lowers it, and leaves the hatch open—a renunciation of secrecy with felt cost ("agreements make ghosts hungrier than finales"). Orientation anchors early (abandoned circus, ticket office, storm). The accumulation of dust-reading, hatch-opening, and mirror-lowering tightens understanding and reweights the "cracks in the façade" motif at closure. Cost is legible: the ghosts depart "like pardons," the barrel is returned, and the narrator walks away "lighter, carrying nothing but the habit of looking up."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly: density builds through layered metaphors and whisper-frost mechanics until the press-bite ruptures the orchard, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Who/where/when anchor by the opening lines; the dominant stake—compressing eternity into one bearable page—is signaled early and reweighted at closure when "eternity…agreed to be held for a heartbeat." Cost is visible: the seam ruptures buoyancy, the orchard remaps, and the operator re-corks the bottle with "new silence," foreclosing further attempts. One micro turn (Glasswright's warning) deepens pressure without fragmenting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (baroque asteroid, visible time, burnished sorrow) and the tribunal device, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the judge declares the city an open conservatory. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Neris, Lattice Vault Seven, tribunal context by ~10% mark). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost—Vark bows "annoyed but alive to history," Neris drapes the last mirror, and the final lines reweigh prior material ("defunct heart considers revolt again"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard's second tableau mirrors the present tribunal, reframing the Ancients' choice as craft unfinished rather than decadence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: the elders amend their oath, morning is released, and the compromise is "hammered thin like leaf" with visible social cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered metaphor and the final image reweights the rust-versus-light opposition. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~150 words; "when" clarified only after "first morning without dawn"), causing brief disorientation, but the delay does not obscure the closure unit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the repairman crosses into midnight and the hinge choice prevents future betrayal, narrowing the constable's options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonant images (compass, seam, explorers-as-listeners) and deepens through psychometric readings that reweight the lagoon from physical space to metaphysical threshold. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist becomes "caretaker of this secret and its hinged awakenings," and the village hears waves "now that the factory is quiet"—a reconfiguration of silence and agency with felt cost (the protagonist returns changed, holding what must be kept). The orientation anchors (petrichor collector, cliffs, factory shutdown) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seam opens and the explorers are revealed not dead but transformed into "listeners to the stone," raising conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with disorientation (storm, GPS failure) and anchors who/where by the archway paragraph; orientation passes. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist internalizes the shelter-building lesson and commits to collaborative work in the village, reweighting isolation into alliance. Cost is conceptual—shifting from solo sculptor to community facilitator—but legible in the final image of holding the slide "to bless the bolts with memory." One meaningful deepening (shelter-building under the arch) tightens the stakes. The lens holds, though some causal ellipsis (how exactly the slide "throws hints" that enable construction) blurs mechanical linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric-essayistic pattern early (postcards as bridge, glass as guide, flowers as teachers) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the protagonist realizes "love…not a blaze but a tender shadow" and walks home "ready to paint without asking for permission"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (renouncing certainty). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (crypt walls, cathedral, cloister gardens, winter's end). The closure reconfigures the opening question through layered observation rather than causal reversal, which fits the inferred lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist recognizes "my question had been, which was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm," tightening the stake from intellectual to ethical. Cost is legible: the protagonist leaves behind the postcards and the certainty of a map, accepting practice over mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and teaches an accumulative-textural lens by the first third: layered historical recovery through cipher, debris-pattern, and lagoon reflection. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara commits to preserving contradiction rather than flattening the record, and the cost is conceptual (accepting moral complexity) with the final image of Esteban "lowering himself into a sentence he could finally finish" charging prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon's reflection supplies the second half of the cipher, reweighting the entire decryption method. However, the decision to "parley with pain instead of prosecuting it" is articulated rather than tested by a dramatized choice with visible forfeit, leaving cost more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by line 2 (kneeling alchemist, pebbled strand, paper-lantern cove). Closure achieves Charged Poise—the final image of measuring by lantern light with the sea as metronome crystallizes the civilization-building project with undeniable cost (patience, refusal of rescue, stripped romanticism). The accumulation builds through pattern: lantern light → amber lens → projected map → scaffolds → two women joining, each beat reweighting "ghost town revival" from metaphor to literal practice. Cost is conceptual and felt: "Not a spell, but a civilization conceived at weather's lip, held to shape by light."

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis: the protagonist writes the prophecy beside the split rather than sealing it, accepting the cost of exposure to preserve emotional legibility. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through the grooves, bark, and memory until the final image reweights "oath" from binding to witnessing. Orientation is anchored early (orchard atop skyscraper, after foghorn, oath scribe). One tightening occurs when the prophecy reveals the scribe's own signature in the grooves, narrowing options to complicity or witness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening lines (icebound atrium, after hatching, seed-saver narrator). The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered attempts (singing through the cap, threading vowels, forming the unlock phrase) that culminate in the doors opening with "patient click" and the narrator's vow to guide neighbors. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image of marking plantings and reopening town paths crystallizes the inherited duty with felt cost (the spent cap, the vow extracted). The causality is atmospheric rather than mechanical, but the because/therefore chain remains legible under the accumulative lens: grandmother's teaching → egg as timed message → song through cap → entropy decrease → door unlock → continuation of inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (microclimate monitoring, solstice hush, mountain breath) and the closure—switching to standby and muffling the bell—reconfigures the stakes with visible cost (professional risk, district director's expectation defied). The cost is legible in "the only metric that mattered was the bell rope's clean, unstartled sway" and the deferred report-filing. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator's patient care and the crew's conversion secure "a season," foreclosing the dismantling path with visible cost (the decommission notice deferred, the station's fragile survival). The accumulative/textural lens holds: chalk tracings, the lantern glass circulation, and the final breathing-with-the-sky image deepen without requiring causal reversal. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One tightening: the meteor drizzle becomes a rush, and tracing persuades the station into tune, shifting the crew's stance. Cost is legible in "granted the place a season"—a conditional reprieve, not a permanent victory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Mara, oasis, post-visibility) and teaches its pattern early: lyric fragments cohere around the covenant and the box. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ghosts lift their veils, Mara bows, and the hives "click yes"—reweighting prior material with felt relational cost (the covenant retied through gesture, not speech). Cost is legible in the image of her carrying the box "like a heart" and the promise to "carry weight, not translate it." One meaningful deepening suffices under the accumulative lens. The ending lands cleanly within the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where by the emerald silo paragraph (~15% in), meeting the window. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ribbon settles, the capsule heals, and the narrator commits to the method of "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions" going forward, reweighting the opening premise with felt cost (lightness from returning borrowed coins). One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment clicks and releases the ribbon's instructions, narrowing the narrator's path. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the poet returns to observation after an enacted intervention, memorializing the moment as a "woven dawn" with visible cost—the featherless quill tucked away, its "second life" spent. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive smoothly within the opening lines. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through the kite sequence, pattern breaks when the string snaps, and the final image reweights the opening stillness with the cost of participation. One tightening (the snap) narrows options and forces the poet's stance shift from observer to actor, then back to witness with a changed tool and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—density increases through layered alignments (orchard paths, copper circuits, rune-marked seeds) until the chamber opens and the protagonist proposes a pact, crystallizing the interspecies-respect stake. Orientation is clean by line four (island, temple orchard, caretaker, six-month prognosis). The closure is Charged Poise: the protagonist stands centered where orchard and temple trade breaths, beginning the ceremony of listening—a crystallized stance that reconfigures the human/pillar relationship with the conceptual cost of relinquishing mastery for partnership. Cost is felt in the shift from "remodel" to "remodel of the heart" and the explicit surrender to listening. One meaningful deepening: the storm opens the chamber, revealing seeds and weather-runes, which the protagonist then answers with the proposed pact—each beat narrows toward kinship as method. The two-shard structure (initial work, storm revelation + pact proposal) coheres under the accumulative lens without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through sensory and conceptual density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "homecoming is an exchange constant, not a place" crystallizes with the linked-arms descent and deliberate garden formula. The closure reconfigures the journey's meaning with conceptual cost (unruly protocol becomes necessary apparatus). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The ratio discovery (three to five to eight) provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line ("After the reef dies, the blooming jetty at twilight becomes my station"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pattern-taught callbacks (birds, pods, dead languages, jetty) accumulate density and the final image—"the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise"—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the submerged concord that "nobody signed" now proven by roots. Escalation reads as cadence shift and thematic deepening rather than causal tightening, consistent with the chosen lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veteran's grief converts to planting action, altering the dominant stake from solitary ritual to shared restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator gains water for the settlement and receives the brother's invitation ("Bring the leaf when you come"), crystallizing a path forward with the cost of delayed reunion now reweighted as shared survival. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered riddles, the phonograph message, the amber-revealed map, the spindle turn, and the water discovery, culminating in a cadence shift where solitary grief becomes communal sustenance. Orientation anchors who (narrator + Gable), where (scrapyard settlement), and when (post-war nights) by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf decodes the cylinder's hidden text, narrowing options from aimless mourning to a concrete quest with stakes (finding water, eventual reunion).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds pressure through layered observations, sketch overlays, and the discovery of a vector pointing to bedrock. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist aligns the dome's attention with the valley hum, a decisive reweighting that forecloses evacuation and embraces pariah status. Cost is visible: professional isolation, signing with the mother's name, and the knowing acceptance of no applause. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening lines (deck, post-shutdown, solitary).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "we amended ourselves to it, and promised to keep learning how to listen" reweights the vow premise with conceptual cost (sameness abandoned, flexibility embraced). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel's betrayal secret is accepted and the false king melts, opening the stair—this narrows options and charges the final amendment. Cost is legible in the conceptual shift from "fix" to "amend" and the acceptance of wrongness, though the felt price remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (chessboard, tiles, dome echoes) and the final walking-words sequence reconfigures the narrator's relationship to memory with felt cost. Orientation anchors quickly (whispering gallery, interregnum, narrator as crisis-actor-turned-survivor). The closure—walking LISTEN, STAY, MEND and receiving the Custodian's nod as "both sentence and pardon"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the choice to "teach grief to migrate." One small gap: the transition from walking BEGIN to the full walking method feels compressed, but causality holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Accumulative/Textural lens taught early through layered metaphor and cadence, and the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "home is not an address but a practice"—reweights the dominant stake. However, orientation anchors (who the protagonist is, concrete grounding in time/place) remain elusive past 120 words; the "labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain" is vivid but spatial choreography inside is vague. Cost at closure is felt conceptually (releasing breath, receiving permission) but the choice does not foreclose a live path dramatized earlier. The closure reconfigures meaning via accumulation, satisfying the chosen lens, but the lack of a concrete before/after choice limits closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): the tutor forgives himself by tying the final knot, the village breathes, and he chooses the bench to "teach any child the opening called mercy." Cost is visible (the pawn sacrificed, exile's weight lifted but not erased). The accumulative lens—woven hush, threaded interventions, distant thunder as metronome—holds throughout and tightens once when the tutor realizes the puzzle requires self-forgiveness. Orientation anchors by line 6 (mail coach, snow, square, labyrinth). One meaningful deepening: the shift from "refusing comfort" to accepting it charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens inferred: pressure builds through nightly poetry sessions that teach the canyon to multiply meaning, culminating in the climactic address to the spire where braided voices refuse singular confession. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the spire shivers, torchlight fractures, and the protagonist offers a conceptual repricing of forgiveness with undeniable cost ("hold the shards without cutting ourselves into lies"). Orientation anchors (canyon, bone towers, spire, ritual timeframe) land early. One meaningful deepening: the echo-practice escalates from silly rhymes to a communal weapon that forces elders to confront their inadequate rules.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is established early (workshop, acid sea, alchemist at work) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (pockmarks-to-gear ratios, kintsugi seams, the charm's warmth) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the melted charm seals the heartplate and the wheel turns—Charged Poise that crystallizes survival and earned repair. Cost is legible: the charm is destroyed, the dives exact physical toll, and the final image of pressing his forehead to the warm plate carries the weight of temporary reprieve with more work ahead. One minor clarity slip: the statue's function as lighthouse versus prow ornament blurs spatial logic briefly, but does not break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through mirror-crack → cave descent → painting act → shell-floating → stranger-reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the painter gains "another surface that could briefly hold me and let me go." Cost is legible: he leaves the canvas to the tide, unmooring but anchoring elsewhere. Orientation anchors (painter, quay, rented room) land by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pool "decided to reveal a stranger," reweighting his relationship to surfaces and time.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The pattern—narrator layers whisper, scent, light, and waiting—is taught early and tightens through density increase and cadence shift when Mara's skiff turns. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the light has been holding you, and the garden will not let you be alone" crystallizes the thesis with felt relational cost (exhaustion, relief, Alder's reluctant witnessing). Orientation anchors dawn, post-heat-wave, cobalt lighthouse by line one. One meaningful deepening (the skiff's slow answer) narrows uncertainty and reweights the narrator's stance without requiring a causal reversal. Cost is visible in Mara's "blown pale" face and the narrator's breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who (patchwork navigator), where (signal station), and stakes (guide convoy home) by line 6. The piece teaches its lyric, mosaic pattern early through recurring image clusters (dish, censer foot, moon phases, Rowan's voice) and sustains coherent pressure as the narrator rigs the broken hydraulics and sends directional pulses. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe, and I send one last bearing home"—the final lines reweight all prior labour from reunion quest to grief navigation with palpable cost (deflection of homecoming hope). One meaningful deepening occurs when the convoy reaches the harbor and the narrator shifts from map-giver to solace-giver, narrowing his role with conceptual price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by ~100 words (ravine, orchard, truffle foraging post-virus). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered particulars (smuggled eye, circle meetings, mycelium as metaphor) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure: burying the eye and continuing the circle "with fractured grace" is Earned Stasis with visible cost (loss of the relic, acceptance of fragility). One meaningful deepening when the narrator realizes "the circle should not depend on contraband" and acts on it. Cost is legible: the eye is gone, the support structure remains precarious, yet the practice persists.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—pattern accumulates through gaps, pauses, and absences that build density toward the recognition scene. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's acknowledgment and the keeper's decision to continue signaling crystallize his role as "lantern and harbor both" with felt cost—he accepts witness-work as perpetual, not transactional. One meaningful deepening occurs when absence spelling becomes legible instruction, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is visible in the keeper's acceptance of margins and borrowed memories as his permanent station.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors early (antique map dealer, creek, valley shop). The closure unit—Elias withdrawing the chip, returning to build a footbridge and open his shop as shelter, the final treaty with ants—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Earned Stasis): he does not escape loneliness but reweights it through chosen action, and the cost (relinquishing drift, committing to the valley and its people) is visible in the stacked pallets and sign. The accumulative method (promise → map → ants → cavern → press → return → shelter) coheres under the lens and lands cleanly. Small penalty: the seam of water and shifting maps, while vivid, risks convenience—no prior setup teaches the mechanics, and the resolution hinges on withdrawing the chip without dramatized struggle or alternate-path temptation in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (queen, hall, ridge, after the final warning). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery of "bleeding starlight" and two-grotto breathing culminates when the queen presses her palms to basalt, cools the ember grotto, and prompts the cobalt vault to "ring once like glass"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the two lungs synchronize and a steady wind begins. Cost is conceptual (she unmakes her wedding crown) but legible on the page. The connector tissue between dream-summons and the physical closure ritual feels slightly underbuilt; one more causal beat linking starlight wound to the coronation fire would tighten escalation into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, metaphoric diction, ritual structure) and builds through a series of calibrations that reweight the experiment's meaning. Orientation anchors who (pocket-sun alchemist), where (ember nexus plaza), and what (reactor experiment) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the experiment succeeds, presence "compresses, warm as a held breath," and the narrator and Lio walk home with "joy [having] the heft of a carefully placed stone"—the abstract goal has been made tangible with visible cost (the shared secret, the vulnerability of whispering it). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio whispers the secret and the reactor "blooms open like a small dawn," transforming the technical experiment into an emotional one. The cost is legible: intimacy was required to achieve scientific success, and the plaza's ordinary commerce resumes afterward, suggesting the moment was singular and non-repeatable. No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (grave → cabin → scroll → ridge) with clear transitions and a coherent lens held to closure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist commits to "keep the ledger…not to win immortality, but to keep the time honest" and "let the mouth keep eating the stone until meaning appears"—a renunciation of simple resolution with visible cost (older, kinder, but bound to the task). The birch-bark scroll and the grave recur with reweighted meaning. One meaningful deepening occurs when envy softens into questions and the dream provides verbs that alter waking tactics. Cost is legible in the final image: "the scroll rattled softly, a wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through layered sensory attention and metaphoric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Conceptual Repricing) where the screw remains as shrine and the clock's "forgiveness that remembers the work ahead" reweights time as "quilt, stitched by the hands that need to count." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure image—"tiny applause shaped like water meeting time and finding mercy"—lands with conceptual cost (the midwife's implicit loss is honored rather than erased) and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wire adjustment becomes an act of commemoration rather than pure repair.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece accumulates pressure through layered sensory ritual and reflective fragments until the hinge rune reweights the central question (scars as cures versus bridges). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the scars as shorelines rather than failures, and the cost is legible in the breath-holding ordeal and the final image of "new weight and new buoyancy." Orientation anchors who (budding rune scholar), where (floating platform), and stakes (inscribe hospitality runes before thunder) within the first ~100 words. The single-scene, reflection-interleaved design teaches its pattern early; the reflective blocks (mother's silver thread, grandmother's laughter) anchor in present stimuli and tilt the present stance via on-page micro-choices (sugar pebble, touching the earstone). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice loosens and the rune "began to breathe," narrowing options and changing the protagonist's approach to the hinge rune.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors by line 3 (archive, orchard countdown, apology mission). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through induced-current ritual, Aunt Lin's voice materializes via hymn fragment, and the closure reweights the narrator's column promise with the cost of partial reconciliation plus orchard erasure. The hairline crack in the bottle and Mara's hand-on-mine mark Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options and stakes crystallize, cost is felt. One causal slip: the "investors folded the orchards" backstory arrives late without on-page dramatization, weakening the orchard-threat immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: "who" and "where" anchor by the opening lines; "when" (across a universe's hiccup) is signaled early; waive penalty. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (spiral pacing, layered image-work, pattern of refinement). Closure attempt: the protagonist places the book on the dais, invites the chorus to lean over it, and speaks a unifying sentence; the library "listens back" and the illusion folds into the definition. This reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spiral arbitration completes and the definitions expand to include what refused them), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered on the page. The final image offers thematic repricing without a legible price paid, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors early (fjord station, night watch, hydraulic shepherd). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator accepts the "razor edges" and the braided tempos without solving the drift, crystallizing a stance toward time measurement with visible cost (the acceptance that clocks "measure the changes we can bear"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mantle clock key unsticks the valve, restoring the needle's duty. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final watchkeeping posture. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the first three sentences (who, where, when). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the layered discovery of the father's handwriting in the archive, the nurse-name coincidence, and the childhood signal phrase, deepening rather than reversing stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the shared lantern moment and his agreement to eat reconfigure their relationship without resolving the underlying tension, with the felt cost visible in "I steadied his cup and thought about betting and models, fathers and daughters." The cost is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final paragraph rather than concentrated in a single decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates pattern through wrong-number interventions (widow/violinist, baker/custodian) and deepens via the final pairing of band-leaver/marriage-leaver, reweighting "teach endings how to begin" through their mirrored invisibility/visibility. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the operator fades to let their voices meet, then polishes the disc "in the coat sleeve I no longer wear"—a renunciation image that forecloses direct connection with felt cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the operator moves from facilitation to self-erasure at the ending, narrowing the stance from helper to ghost. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the piece teaches its ritual-ledger pattern early and deepens through density increase and cadence shifts. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archivist closes the locket "not to deny her, but to preserve the weight of small moments," crystallizing the covenant's survival through chosen limitation with undeniable cost. The Orientation Test is waived—who/where/when anchor by line 3, and the twilight timing frames the ritual window. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locket photo is pressed into the ledger, narrowing options from hope of return to acceptance of absence as functional ache.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—rumor density builds, reciprocity chains multiply, the moon rock becomes a collective polite excuse. Orientation anchors who/where by ~80 words ("disused railway station overgrown with ivy"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: "crisis has become community without anyone asking permission" reweights the opening isolation with textural deepening, and Mara's placement of the fragment on the platform finalizes the shift from personal cure to shared mechanism. Cost is oblique—she "felt seen only by their needs," implying emotional substitution—but the ledger's bulge and the surveyor's chess partner signal communal transformation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, the pause of shifting constellations) arrive early and remain stable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory language and the final image (ring as tool, stillness as guide) reweights the opening's "quiet blaze" with conceptual cost—he carries the melody forward as a mapmaking method. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he completes the dowsing and internalizes the stillpoint, foreclosing the search with the cost of permanence ("stayed like a faithful star"). One deduction: the causality of how tracing the tone into the ring's grooves enables his future maps is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page, and the cost remains implied rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (anomaly sings, array gropes backward) and escalates through density increase—wrong seed → unmade call → bent spine → coolant beads. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the past "invited to sit differently" reweights the opening mistake with visible cost (the pen's resurrection, the shuttle's ornamental beads). Orientation anchors are present by line three. One micro turn (pen revival) sets up the final reconfiguration without breaking accumulative coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of signing → harbor response → crowd involvement that builds through density and cadence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the empty photograph "contains the whole harbor breathing"), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific path is foreclosed on the page. The police captain's sudden shift ("his face softens") lacks causal grounding. Orientation is clear early (harbor, moonlight, narrator with camera).

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (arsonist narrator), what (search for Mira), and stakes (rescue vs. betrayal of archive) within the opening moves. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues gather density (coordinates in foam, date in clay wing, breath-map) until the tapestry unlocks the chamber and Mira's message reweights the arson. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into Earned Stasis): "matches in a jar of water, a promise afloat" crystallizes the stance with palpable cost—fire kept but constrained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes the crossed-out eyes are shutters, not erasures, reframing prior guilt. Minor slip: the archive's stone doors "weigh" the narrator then "allow debt to accrue" without clear on-page cost mechanic at that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds through sound-garden mechanics, drumming beats, and layered memory fragments until the final image crystallizes Charged Poise ("I left carrying auroral sorrow like a lantern, drumming tomorrow on ribs"). Closure lands on-page with felt cost—the narrator accepts permanent outline blur to sustain shared dream, foreclosing solo embodiment. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. One tightening choice at midpoint (consent to deeper coherence) narrows options and charges the ending. The experimental garden's rules remain consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The challenge is signaled early (guide the courier by whispers before dawn), pressure accumulates through the storm's charged air and Otero's bellowing failures, and closure arrives as the courier emerges and the narrator articulates the method: "a whisper enrolls the corrugations and walks farther by not fighting." The cost is visible—Otero concedes, the crew cheers, the narrator trades tickets for tea and oranges spaced as beacons—reweighting the opening premise with a felt communal shift. Orientation is clear by line 2 (port city, labyrinth, maintenance worker). One minor causal seam: the "key with no apparent lock" that pops open whisper vents feels slightly under-explained in its mechanics, though the story teaches its function through action.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardian honors the vow, the boys are saved through silent ritual rather than speech, and the cost—maintaining wordlessness despite urgency—is felt throughout and crystallized in "our bargain stayed wordless." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered imagery (rain, mirror, shutters, star) and the final paragraph reweights the opening stillwater motif. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hand surfaces, converting passive watching into active retrieval without breaking silence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who: coach, where: library, when: afternoon routine). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the synchronized window displays, and the cadence shift at "the town slipped into a listening posture" reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the council member's hesitation and request for "studies and stays" crystallizes options with felt pressure, even though the final vote remains off-page. One deduction for the ellipsis between the window night and "the next week," which compresses causal linkage slightly, though the essential cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through repeated whale calls, island appearances, and the scrimshaw's resonance, culminating in a collective softening ("the pier loosens its bolts like kind wrists"). Orientation anchors late—"sublittoral fringe" and "harbor" are named early, but the who/when remain atmospheric rather than concrete past the 120-word mark (−0.3). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community joins the narrator in surrender, reweighting the opening premise "after violence becomes impossible." The cost is conceptual—the relinquishing of control—legible in "we detach our fears from fear itself," though the felt price for the protagonist individually could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, post-mandate era, performer alone) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the inspector's arrival, the performer's deliberately ambiguous show, and the inspector's nod—a "country of approval now"—which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist crystallizes his stance (no more teaching forgetting, only lightness that doesn't deny weight) with visible cost (the regime's metrics cannot capture fidelity, and he accepts the gap). The final image of carved birds on fence posts with tucked petals reweights the bouquet and the hush motif, making the cost undeniable. Closure is on-page, lens holds, one meaningful deepening via the inspector beat and dusk ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines and the ban-lift timeframe is clear. The piece accumulates density through the paraphrase action and colonnade response, building to the ice-crossing and pier moment; the final wall inscription offers Conceptual Repricing with the idea that "boundaries consented to dissolve." However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible foreclosure of a path or felt price on the page. One meaningful deepening (quartz hum dropping, path appearing) but the closure image asserts rather than demonstrates consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it: the courtyard hush, the cracked phoenix, the mounting exchanges of awakenings build toward the ending's resonant reconfiguration where "practice becomes festival" and the failed bird is reread as home. Orientation anchors (who, where, post-phoenix timeframe) arrive by the opening beats. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—the flawed phoenix reweighted as purposeful, the crack given voice—and the cost is legible in Mara's wreath and the city's shift from "safety" to "practice." One meaningful deepening (the reed insertion and its consequences) tightens the dominant stake. The lens remains coherent, though causality between individual client visits and the final communal understanding is more textural than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The opening anchors who/where/when by line 2 ("laboratory of lost sounds," "prism-song bell ringer"). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—through the image of neighbors trusting "the slow bell of each other" and the narrator's realization that "gentleness propels, and propulsion here is simply permission." Cost is conceptual and social: the artificial pilgrimage must "change with those who travel it, or else it hardens into scenery," foreclosing the path of a fixed ritual. The lens holds without contradiction; pattern accumulates through bell-tuning, lens use, and stations, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise)—the narrator commits to ongoing tending with visible cost ("keep leaving origami figures," "ready to illuminate again"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 2 (mourning jewelry maker, timeless observatory, after rock bottom). One meaningful deepening occurs when the stencil reframes ash as growth instruction, tightening the dominant stake (transform grief into light). Cost is legible: the narrator remains open to grief's weight rather than escaping it. The accumulative pattern—repeated images of breath, light, seeds—coheres and the ending reweights prior material without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph; no penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pulses, routes, patterns layer toward a final image of collective presence. However, the closure unit lacks a decisive on-page cost—people arrive "without texts" and the room "kept humming," but no choice is forecloses, no visible price paid, no felt tension resolved. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat, only ambiance and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who (historian), where (pagoda archive), and when (twilight) cleanly by the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through the purification sequence and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): releasing the cages into the central chamber forecloses the hoarding path with conceptual and relational cost ("opening a vein and watering the street"). The cost is legible in the final image of mirrors showing child and scholar, though the causality of the pagoda's response (new stairs unscrolling) feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (blooming library, returning stone, silent reels) and accumulates density through the shadow's gradual remembering. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening lines (library above clouds, dusk, narrator's role). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the shadow settles, the book takes root, and the narrator's posture—"keeper of dusk, smiling with luminous regret that still chooses dawn"—crystallizes a stance with conceptual cost (endurance, witness). The cost is legible in the final image's charged poise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone circuit closes and the shadow pours its yearning; the floor tilts, pressure accumulates, and the resolution reweights hope as "a shelf that flowers…provided someone waters it with memory and witness."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric syntax, accumulative pressure via imagery and reflection) and holds it through closure. Orientation arrives promptly (sanctuary yard, handler, post-scandal timeframe). The closure—"a whisper against my skin, steady as breath, as if blessing a promise not to lie anymore"—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights trust and repair with felt cost. Cost is legible: the handler's "anger was real" and the conditions imposed ("repair, not hideout") foreclose easy reconciliation. One meaningful deepening (confession → conditional offer) narrows options under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The pattern is taught early (waking, fern speaks, coffee-ring reading established as method) and deepens through the tunnel descent and elm encounter. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist renounces the old method of opening wounds without consent, accepts that scars can be read without erasure, and the final image reweights the initial question with visible cost (the scar "opens like a book that stays intact"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One credible tightening occurs when the ivy refuses to yield the miracle without being read first, forcing the protagonist to negotiate and perform a consensual cut rather than simply reclaiming what was lost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—images and motifs layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (projection booth, crystal gazer, theater manager) arrive early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final threading of blank leader "glow[s] like mercy," reweighting unused love as transparent beginnings with undeniable pressure; the cost is conceptual (goodbye letters practicing vowels, a promise waiting) and felt in the image. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gazer moves from sensing to harvesting, narrowing options under the inferred lens. The causal through-line is soft—psychometry reading yields insight, harvest follows—but the accumulative design and charged final image hold the closure effect legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and teaches an accumulative/textural lens early: the protagonist traces star-routes through the instrument to unlock trapped creativity. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis—"I bowed and let the instrument rest again upon the stone"—with the conceptual cost legible in "a thin line of cold remained inside me" and the promise to "watch whenever stars begin to fall." The causal chain is present but sometimes elided ("stepped into a night deeper than weather," "shaped the silent chorus into a key") in ways that favor lyric resonance over mechanical linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fledglings open their eyes and creativity walks back, tightening the stakes and demonstrating cost. The lens holds, but the middle transitions rely on poetic compression that occasionally obscures the exact mechanics of unlocking.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guard boards again, carrying forward his oath and the archive's whisper, with the chess clock remaining frozen—a refusal to resolve the temporal standoff that charges the final image with ongoing cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece accumulates pressure through density (dune blooms, sparks planted, basement matches catching) and the final cadence shift ("he will return") reweights the opening drift into committed endurance. Orientation is delayed—"who" and "why" emerge gradually through the first third—but the disorientation serves the dreamless, unmoored atmosphere and pays off when the oath crystallizes the stakes, so the penalty is waived. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archive demands proof and he places his palm on the clock, narrowing his options and sealing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its pattern early (mechanical rainforest, sound-mapping, recurring gear) and layers density toward a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words, though "after the sixth sense awakens" remains abstract until context accrues. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the gear is revealed as a tooth from the protagonist's own gate, and the final image ("I am the frontier") reweights the premise. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted ("I chew") rather than felt on the page with visible consequence; the tower's opening and the protagonist's lift through the canopy occur without tactical constraint or visible price paid. The because/therefore linkage between beats is soft; the translocation, the figures testing with questions, and the tower's appearance feel sequenced by metaphor rather than motivated causality, lowering confidence in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear RR (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the protagonist learns to wait rather than chase, and the dog's approach confirms the tactical shift with felt cost in the required gentleness. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (broken leash, ridgeway, ferry guides by ~100 words). The escalation unfolds through a meaningful deepening—panic to vigil to reunion—that narrows options under the inferred lens. One mild causality slip: the fox's shadow "pointing" feels convenient rather than earned, though it does not break the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (fortress, nerve regeneration, bellhop) land by paragraph four; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late Situational crystallization when the bolt is reversed. The closure achieves Charged Poise: reversing the bolt's pitch creates a hinge for future sound, foreclosing complicity and reconfiguring the fortress's balance with visible cost (the protagonist must now "stand with those whose hands kept the fortress breathing"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bellhop reveals the engine's function and the protagonist sees the ledger of "voices held in escrow." Cost is legible in the protagonist's spoken refusal and the bellhop's tremor, though the final image's conceptual weight slightly outpaces its dramatic immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens; closure arrives when Lys draws a line through the pretender's title and "books breathed open, coughing up alternate margins." That image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (the pretender's lacquered history shatters), satisfying Conceptual Repricing. However, orientation remains hazy past 120 words: who Lys is, her physical presence, and the library's concrete geography drift in metaphor without spatial anchors. The middle accumulates texture (iron gall, cryptic messages, constellation pauses) but causality is loose—readers arrive, the ledger appears, the pretender steps out—without clear because/therefore links. Cost is legible in the final image (the pretender's smile falls, his signet flakes) but the path there feels more summarized than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the narrator discovers the nodal cycle, marks the path anew, and reaches communal understanding—options narrow from mystery to actionable pattern with visible cost (the flats remain dangerous, reefs unrestored). The revelation arrives "late, as if obeying its own tide table," paying off the opening's "delayed revelation" promise. Orientation is clear by line 2 (monitoring station, post-ban). One meaningful deepening tightens pressure when boredom yields pattern recognition. Cost is conceptual and social: "we swear to cross the flats in kindness, light, and listening"—a reconfigured relationship to the environment with acknowledged limits.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (barefoot stargazer), where (repair bay), and when (margin of daylight, lull) clearly within the first third. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered actions (maps → opera glasses → wiring → crank → broadcast) and a cadence shift at the reignition deepens the stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ferry chooses, neighbors respond, protagonist rewrites future); cost is felt in the quiet defiance and the image of neighbors as constellations. One meaningful tightening—"the coil took the hum"—narrows options and the final image reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors early (valley, hot springs, reconstruction, Mara's satchel) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the kite decode, the ritual cycles, and the amber's unsealing until the final image reweights "implanted destiny" with visible cost (Mara's promise, the frond's glow, tradition rearticulated). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Conceptual Repricing): the embryo's translucent frond and Mara's refusal to kneel before growth constitute a decisive reweighting of the premise with conceptual cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (heat-cycle ritual to frond sprouting) is present; the cost is clear in her stance against the council and the seedlings' promised autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through sensory density (spray, wind, gulls, drone hum) and somatic callbacks that teach the reader Samira's embodied grammar; the ceremony pivot crystallizes stakes, and the final image—photograph held where water returns—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she renounces display, accepts ballast) with undeniable cost. Orientation is swift (arboretum, cliff, Samira by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening: the decision to move benches into the glasshouse narrows options and charges the ending. Cost is legible in the photograph's placement and her refusal of the overlook's "applause."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation clearly (lighthouse library, fog, portrait artist) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through image layering (tarot cards, knots, beam), a pattern break occurs when she untangles the shutters, and the final gallery redesign reweights her vocation with conceptual cost (honoring fragmentation rather than fixing it). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the artist's understanding of her work shifts from "steady gaze" to "constellation of tides." One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds, though the causality between untangling and insight could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation arrives swiftly (who, where, eclipse timeframe) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the drone footage, ink patterns, and the recursive sister-memory until the final image reweights the opening grief. Closure lands with cost (bones fractured, rule confirmed), but the causal linkage between "braided noticing" and time dilation remains asserted more than dramatized; the mechanism is told in exposition rather than tested through on-page contradiction or failure. The midpoint ellipsis ("I let myself disappear") compresses the threshold crossing, which fits lyric mode but sacrifices a visible escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the letter walks among readers, the archivist sits with the shadow in shared silence, and the final image—"our silence would speak without permission"—reweights the opening stakes with conceptual cost (the archivist has broken their oath and tilted the slot). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught by the opening's "breathing machine" cadence and held through the "patient fireflies" and "patient librarian" pattern to the thaw-grammar payoff. Orientation anchors clearly by line ~80 (cryogenic archivist, dome library, snow). One meaningful deepening: the letter's release shifts from personal risk to collective unspoken conversation. Cost is legible in the misaligned slot, the added name, and the fear acknowledged but subordinated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through density increase (survivors gathering, father returning, storm arriving) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the father sheathes his knife permanently, strangers leave with rose slips, and the narrator's continuity-weaving method expands outward. The closure carries conceptual and relational cost: the father's identity shift is irreversible, the engraved quiet becomes a shared script, and the protagonist's vulnerability to fifty strangers creates risk. Orientation anchors (narrator, dome, post-tower world) are present by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the father to adopt her method, reweighting his relationship to violence and her garden's role as sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (fisher), where (sound wave garden), and what (catching an echo) by the second paragraph. The piece accumulates density through lyric layering and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the fisher seals the echo and rows toward harbor, ready to "finish the song" and "usher [emotions] home without losing their teeth"—a Charged Poise moment where the cost (drifting as "keeper of echoes") reconfigures his solitary role. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo walks through him "like windchimes" and he answers by voicing silence, narrowing his options to either yield or hold the line. The lens holds; the cost is felt in the final image of him drifting between garden and child.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two sentences; the drive lens is Causal with proof-by-contradiction linkages narrowing Kline's options twice (calibration lamp, histogram analysis), and closure lands on-page when the statement is drafted and the journalist called back—Decisive Change with visible cost (donor anger, reduced institutional shine). The because/therefore chain holds: journalist's tip → confrontation → logical traps → technician's surrender → confession. One meaningful tightening occurs when the technician moves to delete logs, crystallizing the ethical stakes and forcing the protagonist's stair-climb intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the lab-repair frame holds throughout. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered motifs (amber, constellations, letters, waveform cries) until the final tattooing-of-name reweights guilt into cadenced closure. Cost is legible—naming the nephew on metal constitutes visible emotional price and allows the firmware (and narrator) to rest. The self-as-sender twist ("my own handwriting hiding under the flourishes") lands thematically but arrives late without mid-story friction, softening causal tightening; the closure itself compensates by charging the silver-constellation image with irreversible specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (grotto, mist, artist, unlearning) appear early. The piece accumulates through mandala-building beats and interpersonal micro-moments, then deepens when water threads the sand and "patterns… resolved into a map of breath." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "our noise learned to lean, and meaning showed itself in the balance instead of the answer" paired with the artist returning the flake and walking out with weather-like unease. Cost is felt (the artist carries "lilac unease… a forecast") but slightly oblique—no single path visibly foreclosed on the page. The accumulative tightening is sufficient for this length, though the final image could anchor cost more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The plaza tessera seeds early, recurs through retrocognitive visions, and charges the patrol confrontation where renaming becomes tactical necessity. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the leader lowers his rifle, the plaza "tastes like rain making dust into mud," and the narrator renames herself "keeper of soft armored rooms"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (exposure, ongoing vigilance). One meaningful deepening occurs when past-guard and present-leader converge. Orientation anchors are present but delayed slightly; tessera mechanics could be crisper earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning: synesthetic imagery densifies, the tarot coin seed returns reweighted, and the orchard's echo-mechanics accumulate pressure until Rowan's discovery crystallizes possibility. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the blueprint's recovery and Rowan's promise to return with volunteers reconfigures her stance from abandonment to action, with the ghost's whispered "Encore" and the orchard's honey-lime response charging the final image. Orientation anchors (ghost, theater, orchard-maze, after-hours) arrive cleanly within the opening third. The cost is felt—Rowan must risk hope again, the ghost remains bound to facilitation—and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (studio, static shock, Mara, the pill recall) arrive within the first ~100 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (muscovite, wristband, light paths) and the cadence shift at closure—grounding the room and keeping the shard—reweights the initial appetite for listening with visible cost (assuring the recall, promising to keep feet on floor). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist chooses craft over the pill, clipping the coil to soften voices to "neighborhood hum," foreclosing reckless immersion. One persistent constraint (static shock opened the door; grounding coil tames it) shapes the final image. Cost is legible: the protagonist gives up unmediated access and accepts Mara's mooring.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory data, the fossil's recurrence, and the chord's discovery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the protagonist realizes the two leaf imprints are "transitional objects in the purest sense" and feeds the signal into the sleepers' dream loops. Orientation is anchored early (coastal cave, after hibernation, sensory map maker). The closure reweights the opening stake—charting silence to "become the voice of the unknown"—with a felt cost: the protagonist sits alone, aware the logged procedure is "only half of the truth." One meaningful deepening (the chamber chord + heirloom alignment) is sufficient for this length, and the conceptual cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (warehouse catalog, childhood memory, prophecy threat) and holds it through a clear escalation: buttons mapped → echo unsealed → spiral formed → community assembled → rain road opened. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the prophecy becomes "a thread we can keep choosing to pass," reweighting fatalism into ongoing agency with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible in "preserve intention" and the need to keep the cord attentive. The orientation anchor is delayed—"I" is named "hourglass turner" but spatial grounding (beneath cliffs, near sea) accrues slowly across the first third; this is not quite disorientation for effect, yet the anchors arrive piecemeal. The causal chain linking button-spiral to cliff-opening leans heavily on lyric logic ("pattern only we can finish"), which the accumulative lens permits, but the mechanics of how collective hourglass-turning physically opens a seam strain credibility without prior rule-teaching. Cost is visible: the road is conditional, tools must be fetched, and the cord must remain active—"thread we can keep choosing" underscores ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph ("burned spy," "zephyr bluff," "spring"). The Drive Lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture: the protagonist climbs to deliver codes, receives intelligence from the stranger, and proceeds to fix the radio—each beat motivated by prior setup. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the radio speaks, the signal will carry "our small nation of promises," and the cost is visible (the burn erased the tether, enabling solo action). The escalation is modest but present: codes → stranger's vouchsafe → hut repair. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger reveals Mina is alive and assigns the radio task, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist moves from layered palimpsest to a single thread ("stay, and labor beside"), crosses the ford, and walks toward town lighter—a decisive change with visible cost (all prior ornament abandoned). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: fog, waiting, percolation, and ambient awareness build pressure that breaks into simplification. Causality is clean; the coachman's needle-lift and the river's example motivate the protagonist's final stitch. One persistent constraint (the damp tightening threads) shapes tactics and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through braided-light imagery, ritual acts, and the final pulse-answer that reweights the oasis's resistance as "gentle repetitions...which over years harden like glaze." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator recognizes phototropic kindness and tests it, then receives the thrum-answer that reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost: the outcome they will never see. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the place's stubborn mercy is re-priced as accumulated care rather than force—but the cost remains oblique and felt rather than viscerally on the page, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the light net transforms the stairwell, Theo walks alone, Mrs. Gallo hums, and the narrator's hush becomes a harbor—options and meaning are crystallized with felt cost (the tooth rusts, the rosebush is emptied). Orientation is clean by ~100 words, and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated motifs (rhythm of oars, harbor light, hush, tooth) and a cadence shift in the final third reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening: the padlock yields, enabling the installation. Cost is visible in the tooth's future rust and the emptied rosebush, charging the final image. A single minor causality hop—how the mesh was fabricated is told, not shown—keeps this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise). The narrator renounces reunion and commits to "independence" as a stance; the vow and placement of the sundial reconfigure options with a felt opportunity cost (choosing not to crave return). Escalation is density-driven—layered imagery and thematic weight increase—but causality remains diffuse; many beats are observations or reflections rather than because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors late: who/where/when coalesce gradually across the first third without immediate grounding, applying a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the protagonist and the woman stand over the nest, tie their silence to the twine, and the final image ("the thread that connects all things had found us") reconfigures the opening premise with felt cost—public vulnerability replaces private ghostwriting. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Orientation anchors early (ghostwriter, temple, post-storm). One meaningful deepening: the spiral installation transforms passive secrecy into shared witness, narrowing future options with undeniable emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered details (charts, scaffold pulses, community division) and reaches a pattern break when the subsonic scaffold forces the provost to "remember that radios are bridges, not guns," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant: the final hour hums with healing slower than harm, options reweighted). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 6 (narrator, studio, midnight shift); causality coheres under accumulative logic (tricksters feed on attention → narrator shapes form not silence → subsonic interference → squeal and vacancy). Cost is legible: the tower shakes, breakers trip, campus police arrive, and the narrator accepts administration scrutiny to keep the bridge singing. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scaffold turns brittle laughter into "many small denials braided into a rope that snaps." Minor slip: the climax sequencing (breakers trip, provost listens, breakers thrown back, dawn node caught) compresses multiple moves into summary cadence without clear elapsed time or spatial choreography during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (spatial mutiny must be parlayed, not conquered). The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the protagonist extracts the nail-key, promises return with music, and leaves the city mid-rehearsal of its rebellion, crystallizing a stance of patient co-existence with visible cost (the mutiny remains, the protagonist accepts ongoing negotiation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the organ notes transfix the square and the seam opens, narrowing options and raising the stakes of retrieval. The cost is conceptual and relational: the protagonist forgoes mastery and accepts perpetual return.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the captain sits holding his wrists while the portrait creates "a chamber where both guilt and love could breathe the same air," crystallizing options with undeniable pressure even though the legal cost is deferred off-page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density (mist, ribbon, metronome clicks) builds until the captain's breath "stumbles" and the painting unifies opposites, reweighting the dominant stake. Causality holds through motivated ellipsis (the ribbon's "rescuer's knot, reversed in panic" becomes the hinge), and one meaningful deepening occurs when Lio shifts from investigation to portraiture that traps the captain in a moral chamber. Minor penalty: the metronome and ribbon mechanics sometimes blur—"letting ribbon sway, letting steps count their distances"—requiring inference about how these tools extract confession.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through journal decoding → nail bridges sensor → coordinates reveal sky-river → samples found → forecast tightens → approval → staying choice. Closure is Charged Poise: pressing the nail into the table while dreaming "the world softening around our return" crystallizes the narrator's stance—honoring Seraphine now outweighs immediate return—with opportunity cost legible (one more cycle, name filing into forecast). Orientation anchors who/where/what by the experimental station paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mirek warns return is "reversible only as long as you remain useful," reweighting the exile stakes before the stay decision.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of symbolic accretion (glass flake, scaffold wrap, cairn) and the final image reweights the hitchhiker's vanishing through the narrator's acceptance. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator's "heart recounting what it has finally learned to hold and release"—but the cost is stated rather than felt, and the Orientation Test is borderline: "who" and emotional baseline anchor late (~150 words). The accumulative design holds, but the ending lacks a sharp reweighting moment that makes the before/after unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist accepts the circular pattern ("the way we make territories and then orbit them") and enacts it by placing bills as new territorial markers, leaving three for the kid—a choice that forecloses linear escape with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds: the startup collapse, father's methods, and circus train converge in the final image. Orientation is established early (train, tin, highway robber's son). One meaningful deepening occurs when the startup's "polite" geofencing is revealed to isolate neighborhoods, mirroring the father's loops, which narrows the protagonist's self-understanding and charges the ending gesture. The cost—acceptance of circularity over the "line" he swore to be—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through charged callbacks (daylily, breath, variable stars) that reweight the dominant stake (decoding grief into language). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration when the telegram's petals "loosened their held breath" and the narrator presses the flower into the ledger, crystallizing shared burdens with felt cost (the letting-go after the radio transmission). Orientation anchors cleanly by line ~60 words (observatory, narrator, Mara, Orla's telegram). One tightening deepens when Mara finally speaks about the stone's sound, altering the algorithm and unlocking the translation—cost is legible in her jaw unclenching and the team's cathartic response.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is swift: Issa, druid, lake, orchard vortex established by ~100 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through expanding ritual circles, blood offering, seed unfurling, and word-by-word revelation until the orchard "stands down" in the final image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Issa releases the binding she herself wove, reads the confession aloud to the lake, and walks away—renunciation with visible cost ("ache in a clean way"). The lens holds without contradiction, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: root-bound narrator; where: cobalt glade; when: dusk after premature future) arrive by the third paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric compression, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the covenant aligns, the glade and maze agree, and the pair steps into shared wind. Cost is gestured at ("roots loosen enough to allow breath," "ribs ring") but remains largely metaphorical rather than concretely felt as forfeiture or trade-off on the page, keeping the closure from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard sequence accumulates meaning through layered images (roots, pear, card) that converge at the regraft moment, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the protagonist pledges shared breath and the brother's laugh clears. Orientation anchors who/where/what by the second paragraph. Closure cost is present but oblique: "accept the scars" and "promising never again to bargain alone" land as conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or visible tactical sacrifice. The turn from solo bargaining to partnered mending reweights prior material, but the final image ("card cooled to a leaf's calm") resolves tension more than it sustains charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Orientation anchors within the first ~100 words (quarry office trailer, failed TV appraisal). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the protagonist commits to excavation ("midwife a new story from stone") and writes to Abel, crystallizing the shift from shame-driven silence to purpose-driven recovery. The cost is visible—moving from professional redemption to witnessing—and the valley's answer in the final line reweights all prior echoes. One tightening deepening occurs when the rental logo seals the cloth to Abel's tour, narrowing emotional options and making excavation personal.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Cuneiform translator, Magnetic arbor above clouds, night ocean below, after mentor's vanishing) land within the first ~100 words. Pressure accumulates through tactile engagement: seed placed at junction, rails hum, coil grows and roots, fruit forms—each beat deepens understanding and forecloses the rescue fantasy. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts non-ownership of the bridge, promises return with students, and commits to a commons rather than individual mastery. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of "haunted ambitions" and the shift from solo retrieval to patient, collective work. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coil speaks the mentor's final breath, crystallizing that she measured her exit to avoid tearing the world; this insight directly drives the narrator's pivot from mastery to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, pattern-taught imagery, cadence modulation). Orientation anchors arrive late—"tidal atrium," "titan-gear librarian," "after tomorrow disappears"—coalesce only after ~150 words, delaying spatial and conceptual grounding (Orientation Test: −0.4). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the librarian closes the ledger, opens windows, accepts "no tomorrow to chase, only the next tide." The final image reweights the opening's temporal dissolution with acceptance and continuity, but the cost is conceptual (renouncing pursuit of tomorrow) rather than visibly forecloses an on-page path or alters a relationship. Lyric accumulation is legible, yet the before/after pivot is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (bunker inspector, crystal caves, inspection mission) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (pearl breathing cavern air, shell confessions, crowning the stalagmite) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the inspector signs a non-standard decree and walks out by the stone's glow. The cost is conceptual and relational—protocol is broken, partitions are ordered demolished—legible in "demolish partitions, share water, keep the crown lit." One small slip: the transition from reading the shell to crowning the stone compresses motivation slightly, but causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who (truth-seeking river chronicler), where (disused railway station), and when (after stopping medication) within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered acts of returning, mapping, confessing, clearing the clog, and writing the confession, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with Charged Poise). The closure unit—"I would learn to write toward self-forgiveness by doing the unglamorous maintenance"—lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting ongoing burden) and the accordion's final sigh mirrors the narrator's measure, reweighting prior material. The deepening is meaningful: the protagonist moves from evasion to methodical accountability, narrowing options by committing to blunt chronicles and maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: cipher instructions build through propagation delays, fog imagery recurs with shifting weight, and the protagonist's careful documentation accumulates toward the final paradox loop. Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the second letter already present, written by the protagonist's own hand via temporal loop) with conceptual cost visible in the stitched-seal ledger and the paradox of self-authorship. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veiled dreamer realizes responsibility for the second letter. Minor causal friction: the mechanism by which writing "invisible rhythms" produces a physical letter on the desk remains abstract, slightly weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—density builds through plant communion, stain-reading, and the violin's melting until the final act crystallizes the ethical stance. Orientation anchors (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer night, donors at dawn) land cleanly in the opening stanza. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist plays, melts the violin, returns it to the river, and walks away—a renunciation that forecloses the empire's claim with visible cost (the artifact destroyed, her complicity ended, "the decision hurts"). One small friction: the director's late entrance and his ankle-tangled moment feel like a micro-turn rather than integral pressure, slightly loosening the single-scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening line. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual repetition, the emerald's progressive warming, and the aurora's intensification until the final image reconfigures the protagonist's stance with visible cost—she commits to perpetual vigil at the threshold. Cost is legible in "I would keep this grotto at the lip of that threshold," foreclosing departure or ordinary life. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). One friction: the midpoint meanders through backstory without a clear tightening, delaying the emerald's peak use until late; the escalation reads more as accumulation than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (umbral grotto, present caretaking, past fire). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: dense reflection layered with recurring images (hairpin, scalloped basins, vines) that tighten toward the final tendril-tying beat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the hairpin holds green growth "without piercing," reweighting forgiveness as an ongoing practice with visible cost (using what wounded to heal what remains). The cost is felt in the renunciation of chasing versus patient coaxing, and the final image charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hairpin shifts from memory object to working tool to symbolic clasp, narrowing the stance from grief to practice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accretes through the chime reading, the mirror shard exchanges, and the cloak unhooking/rehooking. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara accepts the cloak back "lighter now," and the final line crystallizes their mutual practice of "sincerely insincere" trying. Cost is felt in the exposure required and the conditional signature that keeps "doorways open." Orientation is stable (lighthouse, dawn, after campfire). One deduction: the campfire setup and chime arrangement occur off-page, creating minor ellipsis debt that the piece recovers from but doesn't fully erase.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) at closure—the researcher's vanishing crystallizes the demonstrated lesson with felt cost. The pattern of withholding → observation → final revelation is taught early and paid off when "he was gone, and the rings remained." Orientation anchors are present by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator "read the message in the iron" and the researcher then delivers his explanation, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible: the researcher erases himself to prove the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. The piece accumulates through layered sensory observation and the wandering pulse's gradual approach, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where stillness becomes navigation. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canyon, harmonic stone skimmer, arrowhead). The closure lands as Charged Poise—"this map is never finished"—with the cost legible in the commitment to endless iteration. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pulse "tests me with a stutter" and the narrator holds steady, reweighting the relationship from pursuit to guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds through recurring motifs (mist walking, lingering luminance, brilliant dimness) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (underachieving mage, icebound spire, automated world). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist leaves the keystone unpossessed, carries home "handmade silence," and practices "waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (rejecting city efficiency, accepting underachievement). One meaningful deepening occurs when unstrapping the assistive pack forecloses reliance on automation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: pier lamplighter, harbor, sky lantern release above. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and the parallel ascent of lanterns/descent to wreck, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist emerges changed, "listening begun" replaces work-done signaling). Cost is legible: the protagonist admits seeking transformation and offers "luminous vows," forgoing the shield of passive truth-hiding. One meaningful deepening occurs underwater when the tag becomes a tuning plate and the cabinet "opened without moving," reweighting the quest from literal discovery to interior shift. The lens holds through closure, though the protagonist's agency is more receptive than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the narrator stands "forward, held by the amber, quiet, and angled toward beginning" with cost visible in exhausted resources ("last drips") and sustained doubt. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of ritual, prophecy decoding, and coin-pattern interpretation until the final song crystallizes stance. Orientation anchors who (decision maker), where (observatory deck), and when (after contraction) by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the backwards prophecy reveals "we already sang" and the narrator translates coin patterns into the choice of "patient hello," narrowing options with cost (gentleness over amnesty, guidance after announcement).

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper names their own fear ("Enough"), folding the atlas and leaving the lexicon burning—a visible stance shift with felt cost (accepting limitation after trying to repair all distance). Accumulative/textural lens holds: recordings layer into named monsters, tightening the dominant stake (giving names to nameless fears). Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, dusk, cassettes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the reaper's own voice returns and crystallizes into "Enough."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through Nera's drip-counting ritual, Aro's memory-gift, and the bell's alignment, culminating in the seam stitching itself with silver and fish rising. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell left ringing, Aro's vow of restraint, and Nera's departure with "lukewarm magic proving itself exactly warm enough" reweight the opening emptiness with visible cost (restraint, patience). Orientation is clean by ~90 words (sapphire viaduct, Nera, bell, dawn, empty nets). One meaningful deepening: from ritual to enacted change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (warden, reservoir, twilight ridgeway). The accumulative lens coheres: photographs build toward the communal memorial, and the closure reconfigures the warden's role from enforcer to keeper of lore. Cost is present but muted—the radio call to pause enforcement carries professional risk, yet consequences remain implied rather than dramatized. The lens holds, but the final image ("stories will keep the chime awake") leans abstract where a concrete action would sharpen closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first three lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the brazier ritual, starling murmuration, and crystallized final image of "held breath that calms rather than starves," qualifying as Charged Poise—options and stakes are reweighted even if the cost is not yet paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the crystal to her brow and decides to let the final step "arrive like starlings." The cost remains oblique; the orchard visit does not foreclose a clear path, only postpones one.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor breathes, Lio sleeps, the buckle endures—a crystallized moment that reweights the watcher's burden with visible cost (the voice is mine to hold and to hush). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (lanterns, cables, webbing maps), then the cadence shift in the final lines reweights the dominant stake (trust as small kept promises under pressure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the single-POV, two-shard structure (crisis + resolution cradle) holds coherent pressure. Cost is legible: the narrator chooses to stay, foreclosing departure, with the soundless echo asking her to remain.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through poetic compression and holds it through closure. The ending crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's numbness cracks under trusted responsibility, and the guardianship verdict reweights all prior material with visible cost ("weight had moved into our promises"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brain's testimony shifts the custody question from ownership to direction, forcing the kata response that leads to the shared-guardian resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors emerge slowly but cohere by the tunnel descent (~150 words). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): the conductor completes the ritual, leaves the tuning fork, and the family's "possibility" crystallizes as the house "remembered." Cost is visible in the conductor's labor and the deliberate withholding ("never to return it all"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the laughter shifts from "skein, brittle as frost" to "almost his laugh," reweighting the stake. Lens holds cleanly through accumulative density and cadence shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the pair choose not to cross the threshold, warming "whatever came next" through waiting—a renunciation with visible cost (the guardian's old sky remains unreached). The accumulative lens coheres: mist-circle → pendant → waiting → interiorizing → threshold, each beat deepening the stake from seeking answers to learning restraint. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the comma-ice unlocks the seam, narrowing the path inward and setting up the threshold choice. Cost is legible in the guardian's averted gaze and the mutual decision to hold the veil ajar rather than step through.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: alchemist; where: ember nexus; when: twilight; what: interrupt destiny via crozier transmutation) arrive within the first ~100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through successive fire attempts, the "frozen bloom" motif recurs and intensifies, and the final image (crozier as loop, mills idling, mothers releasing railings) reweights the premise with conceptual cost (authority becomes absence). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the staff "became a loop of nothing you could see straight through"—and the cost is legible (the break "unmade itself and remade as absence"). One escalation friction: the bishop's men arrive as opposition but capitulate almost immediately without a dramatized beat showing their internal shift, which slightly weakens causal linkage at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the city reframed from ruin to receiver, with the instruction "pour the beginnings into the endings" crystallizing a new operational stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds through layered images (star fragment + hush shard, lunar perigee, cave glow) that converge at the bucket's return. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, situation by line 3). One meaningful deepening occurs when aiming between swing and stillness unlocks the hidden signal, altering tactical understanding. Cost is conceptual but legible: accepting the city's new position on the rope implies ongoing labor and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist accepts permanent transience to anchor the ferry, forecloses their own destination, and the ferry "takes on the deep shine of yes." The cost is visible on the page ("I feel my feet thin into wake"). Orientation is initially elusive but taught as deliberate disorientation that pays off when the grotto and spectral ferry materialize. Causality follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the hourglass patterns, radio call, and rope-weaving build density until the final knot releases the transformation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist learns "one deckhand must become the hinge" and accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of connection accumulate through visitor vignettes until Mara herself enters the rigging and confronts her past. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"something accepts her wish to begin again"—that reweights her loneliness-as-architecture premise. Cost is implied through the confrontation with the phantom lover-witness and her admission of fear, but the final image ("walking beside the stranger, their shoulders equal") feels more like permission than a path foreclosed. The lens holds, and the tightening is meaningful, though the cost could be more viscerally legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien contact, teaching edge geometry. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of detail, the petition gaining "a narrow yes," weeks of practice, until the final ascent that validates the method. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the submersibles rise "by that chart" as "the city behind us hums farewell like a solemn, answering star," reconfiguring the relationship between benthic isolation and stellar navigation with felt cost (the risk, the careful timing, the farewell). The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a lost limb, but the final image makes the stakes undeniable. One meaningful deepening—petition to ascent—is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through layered sensory cues (hearing aid pulses, rain-in-heartbeat, glass panel ticking) and tightens via the narrator's micro-choices (tuning the aid, calling witnesses, leading Eli away) that reweight Eli's options. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Eli pockets the photograph and the borrowed heart "keeps its own steady counsel"—a crystallized moment where options are reconfigured and cost is felt (the debt renounced, the living answer chosen). One meaningful deepening is present; cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (tidal rhythm, phase transitions, fragments of technical memory) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ivo's promise to return, his acceptance that the point is vigil not ownership, and the final image of attention "riding the sheath" reconfigure the premise with felt cost—he remains claustrophobic, the archives won't speak easily, and he must keep coming. One meaningful deepening occurs when the electroscope flickers and the file index wakes, reweighting absence into presence. Cost is visible: he closes notebooks without exporting, leaves before the tide, and binds himself to repeated return.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation arrives promptly (observatory, snow, protagonist alone). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist climbs, consults the ghost, reads ink patterns, receives a "corridor" metaphor, and decides to descend with the shard and map. However, the closure—"carrying a weatherproof wisdom that does not forget"—remains abstract; the corridor is a metaphorical gift rather than an on-page choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The decision to descend and show the shard/map to "those who wrote my ending" gestures at stakes but does not dramatize a trade-off or visible consequence on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (ghost offers the corridor), yet the final beat summarizes rather than enacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph; when is implied (dusk, last speakers gone) but remains soft. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator becomes "an instrument more than a mouth," carrying the language forward), and cost is legible in the surrender of personal names and the copper drawn from veins. However, the tightening or deepening across the middle is largely atmospheric—textures accumulate, birds guide, the diamond warms—without a single sharp reversal or choice that narrows options on the page before the final transformation. The ending image reconfigures the narrator's identity with felt cost, meeting the closure requirement, but escalation coheres through density increase rather than a decisive pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (cryptid encounter forces stance crystallization). Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the researcher's false cover metamorphoses into a vow, teaching laughter as communal healing—with felt cost (abandoning pure research posture, accepting a cosmic-joke pedagogy role). The phone-mediated dialogue and arrowhead-singing create a taught pattern that pays off when the arrowhead becomes "a tongue." One meaningful deepening occurs when the pun releases the cryptid, reweighting bitterness into method.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (locust shell, heart rhythms, orchard) that reweights the premise through density increase and cadence shift. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard "simply stood guard beside me, listening for the next request"—with conceptual cost visible in tomorrow's promised confrontation with inspectors. Orientation anchors (sky-bridge violinist, enchanted orchard, living statues) arrive early and remain stable. The escalation from sanctioned performance to active resistance is legible, though some causal steps (how exactly the music loosens the rails, why the statues respond) operate more through lyric logic than mechanical clarity. The final paragraph's forward projection ("I would play before sunrise") crystallizes stance with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph ("disputed territory mailman," "cobalt arcade at twilight," "day's lone mail drop"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated motifs (absences, the storm bottle, the arcade) that tighten into the seventh-night gathering where "the border hums a smaller song." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crowd is "large enough to scare the border, small enough to pass for a vigil," crystallizing sustained pressure with visible conceptual cost (the commander's threat met with "receipts, signatures, and a politely amplified silence"). The inferred lens holds; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by ~25%: the carpenter moves through the train, gathers the halo fragment, installs it, and sings the carousel into motion—a coherent arc of restoration. Orientation (who, where, when) lands by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the carousel beginning to move is a reweighted state), but the cost is invisible; the final image ("the horses felt the idea of movement pass through their legs") is evocative yet offers no legible price paid or option foreclosed. The lack of on-page felt cost at closure prevents entry into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its hyperbolic-geometry pattern early ("I began to learn the library through hyperbolic geometry") and maintains coherent escalation through density increase and image recurrence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I belong to their weather and their measure" crystallizes the stance with felt cost—the librarian's autonomy absorbed into custodial recursion. Orientation is clean by line 3. One micro-turn when the atlas clicks does not fragment pressure. Deduction: the cost at closure is conceptual and atmospheric rather than a hard forfeiture that narrows future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (librarian), where (archipelago), and what (capture dream) by the opening lines; the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early and holds it through closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: leaving the door unlatched crystallizes the narrator's stance—porosity over capture—and forecloses the wish to trap what they love, a cost legible in "so that what I love may pass through." One beat tightens meaningfully (the realization that capturing is really the wish not to be alone), sufficient for this length and lens. A stronger felt cost at closure would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation arrives promptly (locksmith, village summons, scholar at crossroads). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images and ritual actions rather than because/therefore causality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the door opens inward, the scholar retrieves the trapped idea, the valley reels—with felt cost visible in the scholar's trembling hands and the recognition that "shame had been scraped away." One meaningful deepening occurs when the star's breathing realigns the valley, and the lock responds to the hair's scent. The cost is legible: years of folded feeling are released, the locksmith keeps the empty box as testament to what has left.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through recursive imagery (shadow, glass, names, debts) and a pattern of bargains/restitution. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the protagonist corrects the wrong name, recovers sensory fragments, and bows to honor the debt, reweighting prior material with felt cost ("which promises to keep this time"). Orientation anchors promptly (sunken greenhouse, diver return, decades later). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mushroom ring releases fragments and she steps through, then unwinds the wrong name. Cost is legible in the act of speaking the right name and accepting its lining of recovered sensory memory. The mosaic structure (lyric shards linked by motif rather than strict causal beats) teaches its method early and holds coherent pressure to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist explicitly accepts ongoing exile while teaching the hinge to others, a stance crystallization with visible cost ("My own exile was not yet reversible...yet I could teach"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density increases through layered annotations, tea-leaf geometry, mirror alignments—and the final image reweights the dominant stake (ending isolation through mentorship). Causality is clean: each ritual step enables the next, the shadow's release follows logically from the combined elements, and the ending forecloses the archivist's own escape in favor of service.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (orchard, echo orchard, Gray, seed planting) and the final paragraphs shift cadence to communal practice. Orientation anchors late—"verdant parapet beside a waterfall" appears first line, but "who" and "when" remain vague past 120 words without taught disorientation; apply −0.3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise blending into communal Earned Stasis): the seed fulfills its promise, the valley speaks hope, and the pruner's role shifts to teaching. Cost is conceptual—wonder preserved at the price of constant tending—but the final image ("leaf by leaf by leaf") feels more affirmed than foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Gray drinks and reveals "a famine of stories," reweighting the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density, ritual action, and the net's gradual unmaking. Orientation is established early (coastal town, prism sanctuary, mask restorer at work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the father is moored, the daughter is freed from his pull, and the restorer accepts "lucid unrest" as ongoing work. Cost is legible in the coffer's re-burial and the sack exchanged as "a new promise." One meaningful deepening occurs when the final knot releases the coffer, shifting the daughter's relationship to her father's memory. Causality is present but soft; the net's mechanics are more symbolic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pressure builds through layered investigation (map → henge → vault → video comparison → chamber revelation) with each beat adding textural density. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the unsealed panel and "scar that told the truth without spectacle" crystallize a stance on preservation versus exposure with felt cost (professional completeness forsaken for the chapel's continued autonomy). The orientation test passes cleanly with anchor by line 4. One meaningful deepening occurs when video comparison unlocks the mechanism, reweighting the dominant stake from restoration to respectful access. Cost is legible in the final restraint and the incomplete disclosure on the farmer's chart.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes pressure through layered discovery (tape, pulses, stub) and reaches closure when the narrator releases the snow globe, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) that reweights "letting go" from metaphor to physics with visible cost—abandoning evidence, forfeiting proof. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by line 1 (who: diver; where: sunken library; when: after Earhart discovery). The causality within the library scene is tight: finding the recorder → untangling → playback → decoding → reading the stub → understanding → release. One ellipsis (the initial descent) is purposeful and pays off when "after finding Amelia Earhart's plane" recurs to frame the narrator's true motive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered images (lightning/thunder frame, flower press bolt plate, petals as conduit, ghost sampling currents) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final exchange: the ghost asks what the balladeer needs, the answer reframes the wish as collective ("not mine alone, but ours"), and the mural "holds the wish like a lantern" with a promise shaped like a pause. Cost is conceptual—acknowledging unspoken communal needs—and legible in the shift from individual to collective pronoun. The opening anchors who/where/when by line three ("seldom-heard balladeer," "misty courtyard above clouds," "between lightning and thunder"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost samples the mural and compiles a reply, reweighting the balladeer's solo act into systemic intervention. Orientation is clear; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator completes the delivery and witnesses the goggles settle into "sleep," crystallizing the stance of service-bounded love with visible cost (the vow to turn away enacted on the page). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases floor by floor as the diary unfolds, each revelation reweighting the errand's meaning until the final image charges prior particulars (the goggles as altar stone, the forgetter room as grief's architecture). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (servant, elevator, spire). Causality holds: the notebook slips out (floor two), goggles reveal text (floor three onward), map leads to forgetter room (floors eight–ten). One meaningful deepening occurs as understanding shifts from simple delivery to witnessing Madam Vire's designed release.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts that proving absence's fidelity is sufficient wholeness, forecloses rescue, and commits to ongoing witness with visible cost ("almost whole… because the spool has remembered how to wind"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure accumulates through layered acts of categorization and the ribbon experiment. Orientation anchors (sky gondola, post-fall vigil) are clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator ties a line to the absence and it holds, reweighting the vigil from passive observation to active memorial architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (condemned building, tree-trunk library, face-blind artist) land clearly within the first ~15% and hold. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered acts of discovery and painting, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the room births itself into "a portrait of days before faces" and the note offers horizon where none was expected). Cost is conceptual and felt—the artist gives the room a face they can know, foreclosing the option to flee before demolition. One micro-turn (finding the coin, pressing the rubbing, translating it to wall coordinates) tightens without requiring multiple reversals, fitting the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric density and guided discovery by the first third; pressure accumulates through layered clues (phrasebook, hopscotch, birds, net) toward the luminance capture. Orientation anchors early (airship, apprentice, Melora, sky). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the strand "yields like a promise that wants to be kept" and is folded into the dog-ear, transforming "loneliness...into a map we can share." Cost is conceptual and felt—isolation becomes communal artifact—but the physical mechanics (net kisses strand, glow crawls to paper) rely on convenient magic that the text does not earn through prior constraint or price. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hopscotch reveals the path, but no on-page reversal tests the narrator's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the locksmith gathers fragments of prophecy, applies oil, arranges gears, speaks quietly to the frost, and the hall of mirrors wakes in response—a density increase that reweights the dominant stake (repair) with palpable cost (patience, listening, the forfeit of triumph for "a listening"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the machine wakes; the library breathes) with visible cost in the final instruction and the departure "carrying not triumph but a listening." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when he fits the smallest wheel and the mirror brightens, then the final arrangement crowns the floor and the machine responds—sufficient tightening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a ritual pattern (bell relay under arches) and accumulates sensory density toward the nebula's arrival. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the dew arrives, Vine's final chalk message reweights "haunting"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The Orientation Test passes: who (we), where (orchard planet with arches), and when (after strangers become family) anchor by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the sky unbuttoning, the community drinking permission) tightens the dominant stake, but the resolution feels delivered by cosmic timing rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where cleanly by the opening; the lighthouse setting and doomsday-clock mechanism establish stakes early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through nested patterns, the pane of hush, and the lullaby motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the adjuster scatters the lullaby "like seeds" and the beacon turns "not to warn but to welcome." Cost is felt in the reweighting of endings from alarm to companionship, though the tangible price—what the adjuster sacrifices or forecloses—remains oblique rather than unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis. The caretaker returns to duty after guiding travelers safely, explicitly articulating the trade-off: "giving directions empties me of myself, leaving shapes others can survive within." Cost is legible in the final line ("leaving myself behind where no one could touch"). The orchard-labyrinth anchors by line four; the nut's blueprint seed appears early and charges the ending. One tightening (strangers arrive, night approaching) deepens into the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (polymer chemist, ravine, grief over brother) land by ~100 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the bridge-test, shared laughter, and chrysalis release reweight separation into nascent connection with visible cost (her acknowledgment of error, his willingness to step onto fragile filaments). The ravine-as-rehearsal-room motif accumulates density and the final image—"loosened grief became something that could breathe, bend, and, given time, rejoin the human chorus"—reconfigures the dominant stake. One persistent constraint (the polymer's need for mutual weight) shapes the ending. Cost is legible in Mira's continued practice of atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (glass fruit, moonlight rivers, incised absences) and a cadence shift at the protagonist's self-incision that reweights the opening hunger. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist leans over the opened door, hears their own "glimmering parole," and the final image—"beginning again"—crystallizes the cost (his father's silence traded) with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors early (dawn, floating library, booth), and the two-customer structure (woman's transaction, then protagonist's parallel act) provides one meaningful deepening. Minor cost-legibility slip: the line "It sounded like..." offers metaphoric reprise but the immediate emotional or tactical consequence of the self-incision could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): the city's grief is subsumed, hands meet without storm, and the recipe becomes a standing invitation—"Bring what you cannot say, and we will eat until it stops cutting." The accumulative/textural lens coheres: pooled rain → coral pavilion discovery → broth preparation → communal reintegration, with each beat reweighting the dominant stake (managing stored remorse). Orientation anchors (desert fortress, chef, rain) arrive within the first 50 words. One deduction: the castellan's final appearance introduces a new character late, though it does not break causality and the closure image ("kiln-breath quiet") returns to the fortress walls established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: lyric density and patterned callbacks ("hush of borrowed starlight" opening and near-closing) reweight the bridge-building task. Orientation anchors (Mara, clock tower, night) arrive early. However, the closure unit—bridge completion by morning, cuckoo blessing, grain elevator now saying "puente"—reads as summary told rather than a Decisive Change or Charged Poise dramatized on the page with visible cost. The councilman's reversal and the elevator's "rehabilitation" happen off-stage or in compressed montage, diluting causal pressure at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with elements of Situational pressure: the canyon ritual accumulates density through memory excavation until the narrator reaches a stance crystallization. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the decision to "catalog not regret but relief" and "refuse to fossilize the living" forecloses the path of protective grief with felt cost in the final packing gesture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (canyon, moonlit, present tense of transformation). The Cost Proof Test is satisfied: "I could not undo, but I could modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living" and the packing gesture make the renunciation legible, though the price remains more emotional than material.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring images (grotto, tokens, doodle) and a density shift at the inverted chamber. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (who, mist-grotto, hour of inversion). Closure is Charged Poise—the protagonist exits with tokens and the promise to return, reweighting the dominant stake of recovery with the cost of incompleteness ("what remained nested in the upturned lake"). The cost is conceptual and felt but not dramatized in a decisive on-page action. One meaningful deepening (reaching the chamber, grasping tokens) is present, sufficient for this length, though the because/therefore linkage between beats is loose.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words ("tree-song sculptor," "siskin alder grove," "after the hedgehog uncurls"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the protagonist completes one phrase, offers it to river/hedgehog/grove, winds the wires to rest, and promises to return—endurance that forecloses rushing and affirms continuance with visible cost (time, patience, restraint). The lens holds through pattern-building and cadence shift; the final image ("If I am true, the song will outlive me") reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Cost is legible in the repetition of "offer" and the grove's refusal to applaud, which marks the price of listening over performance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates gestures—placing pieces, correlating needle with birds, matching breath to force—and the final libation and rail-song constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant "unshadows") with felt cost (they are "keepers, if only until morning"). Orientation anchors (magnetic nexus, twilight, tutor + student) arrive early. The covenant premise is seeded at paragraph 5, the eclipse backstory at paragraph 6, and the resolution at the ending image; causality is more ritual than because/therefore, but the lens holds and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of silence-cataloging, frequency-tuning, and the clasp's gradual yielding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the clasp opens and reveals fennel/soot rather than script. Cost is conceptual and felt—the narrator sought pauses, not words, and that renunciation charges the final image as fireworks begin. Orientation anchors (workshop, night before fireworks, solo narrator) land cleanly by the first paragraph. One minor friction: the "path to empathy" articulation in the final third edges toward thematic echo, though it's wrapped in particulars (fennel, hunger, fire).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara achieves her goal of teaching stillness within motion, and the village learns to breathe through the stench. The escalation is legible (seed → vigil → bloom → ceremony), and the final image reweights prior material ("her own motion rested"). Cost is implied but not sharply visible: what path was foreclosed, what price paid? The piece holds its accumulative lens cleanly but the cost-proof test reveals only diffuse communal change rather than a single on-page sacrifice or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered imagery (gravity inversion, water-flow navigation, echo-braiding) that converges at the climax when the arrow tip repairs the arch's wound and "every echo, patient and bruised, returns its voice." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist fits the tip, the chamber tightens, resilience is redefined as "a hinge that knows how to slow falling," and she descends with a seed and a pulse-map. Cost is felt in the shaking hands and the conceptual shift from spring-back to slowed falling. Orientation anchors (orchard pilot, gravity invert, floating arches) land within the first ~100 words. The lens holds cleanly and the ending reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered forensic detail, wind maps, and the flight engineer's patch, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final beat—grid holds, notes flutter, gust arrives on schedule—reweights the opening silence with undeniable conceptual cost (the town's fear, the engineer's death, the new order). Orientation is clear by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening (chain of errors → redesigned grid) is sufficient for this length. Cost is felt in the town's silence and the patch's return, though the ending skews reflective rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple lines of lyric description, though the piece teaches its accumulative pattern early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through interleaved bell-ringing, aurora observation, and the sculptor's parallel action, culminating in a final image where the "sculpted hush" becomes a harboring presence. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush "curled beside me like a cat of light"), yet the cost remains conceptual and oblique—the protagonist rests but no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The parallel sculptor narrative provides a structural doubling, but causality between the bell-ringer's actions and the sculptor's success is asserted rather than demonstrated through because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who (driven relic keeper), where (Thunder-echo range), and when (after guardianship) within the first quarter. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the pressure builds through the driftwood arrangement, the flute notes, and the loom imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the protagonist decides to carry witness rather than claim. Cost is felt: the markers curve away from the cave toward the pass and listeners who "must judge the seam." The closure reweights the opening failure as a teaching, and the braid image ties the ending to prior motifs with undeniable pressure. One small friction: the twin-valley figure introduces a mild causal wrinkle (is it memory, projection, or literal bifurcation?) that the text does not fully clarify, though it does not break the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early: pattern of vanishing stars, printing sessions, borrowed traits. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when coalesce only after ~150 words—but the disorientation is taught as part of the "deliberate ambiguity" concept, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (transposed empathy enacted, both characters breathe cleaner), but the cost remains asserted via metaphor ("scratch on him," "shearing") rather than a pointed on-page forfeiture or visible constraint that alters later tactics. One meaningful deepening is present (the lever drops, senses shear) but the final image ("proof hung like a small constellation") recapitulates theme without legible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of noticing/inviting/release by the first cairn encounter, then deepens through the woman's encounter and the protagonist's final walk. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes practice into stance ("notice, invite, release") with visible cost—accepting the mentor's absence and her own jittery need. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 6. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant's gift is recognized as hunger that can "thin the next dawn," forcing the release choice that reweights all prior extensions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure accumulates through layered sensory detail (frost patterns, prism refraction, metal ticking) and the narrator's gradual yielding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—keys set down softly "because I knew now they felt me too"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the narrator must now live as if objects absorb emotion). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One tightening deepens stakes: speaking the father's name transforms the ritual from abstract to personal, narrowing emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres under accumulative pressure—raveling silence, jigsaw edges, amber bead—building density until the final image reweights the orchard from dying to living through the sister's return. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~80 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into fulfillment): the spinner's patient waiting and the bead's journey across impossible distance pay off on the page when the sister arrives wearing the bead, and the orchard shifts from fruitless to "a ferment of warmth, bread, and bees." The cost is legible: seasons of solitary vigil and the spinner's near-sacrifice. One meaningful deepening—her choice to stay rather than cross—tightens options and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated barter cycles, each anchoring a deeper payment (sound → name → laughter) that reweights the protagonist's voice and memory. Orientation anchors promptly (orchard planet, floating arches, blacksmith trade, shaft work). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the final image—"if the silk frays, the bell will still sing, and so will the work my hands remember"—crystallizes the cost (voice "thinned to thread," memories bartered) while reconfiguring the threat into a place made "one deliberate hour at a time." The conceptual cost is legible: the protagonist's interior reserves are spent to hold the world together, and the stance shift from "inevitable breakage" to "enough to keep the sky from falling" lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (sensory map maker) and where (abandoned spaceport repair bay) early; the "murmur of half-remembered dreams" timeframe remains atmospheric but does not create concrete temporal pressure. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory braiding, parallel-universe layering, and the climactic unsealing/redirection that distributes withheld voices across speakers. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the weight lifts and spreads) with felt cost legible in the line "It is lighter because it can be carried by many rather than anchored by few." One tightening (discovering the sealed crate, unsealing it, redirecting the voices) is sufficient for this length and lens. The cost is conceptual and social—voices released into public address—but the protagonist's personal stake or visible price remains oblique, preventing higher entry into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator cannot stop automation but forecloses museum commodification by sealing the letters in an unburnable form, visible cost in "I could not keep the tower from emptying, but I could keep its promise from being put under glass." The accumulative lens holds throughout—gathering letters, stones, sea glass toward a final ritual act. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse supply skipper, Briar Neck, evening run). One meaningful tightening: the threat of archival display forces the protective counter-move. Deduction: the causality between Doyle's rumor and the narrator's specific sealing method feels slightly elliptical; the leap from "archived, cataloged, displayed" to oil-soaked letters in a sealed jar requires inference.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she completes the ritual, the gyre is steered, and the final image of rewrapping the wick crystallizes her custodial role with felt cost ("older and lighter"). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when her laugh "accidentally" summons the gyre, raising stakes, and the beam-weaving sequence tightens pressure toward the ending. Cost is legible: exhaustion, embodied risk, and the knowledge that tomorrow will call another storm.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (steam, mist, light) and deepens through recurring images that shift meaning. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I felt less like a patient and more like a harbor" crystallizes the protagonist's stance with conceptual cost (accepting borrowed identity). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wing demonstration reframes the central question. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of echo over drum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers ritual (logging seams, scooping dream dust, measurements) until the rooftop exchange reweights the maintenance work as witness-keeping. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (tower, labyrinth worker, moonlight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator completes the ritual, receives the trees' answer, and accepts the work's sufficiency without needing declarative proof—"the map would hold" and "some work is finished simply by being carried to the light." Cost is felt as renunciation of conclusive answers in favor of patient continuity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sextant clicks and the numbers "opened like shutters to wind," shifting quantified sorrow from ledger to conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it through closure: density builds via layered images (mica flakes, song fragments, woven threads) that converge in the climactic sky-raising. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, endless night, mica window) land by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn "unknots" and the realm breathes—with conceptual cost visible in "my scattered memories fly toward their owners" (the keeper empties to restore). One meaningful deepening occurs when the last village arrives and their collective song enables the final weaving, reweighting the lone keeper's work into communal restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara accepts the error-as-gift paradox and commits to mending with the note, foreclosing her reclusive refusal with visible cost. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered imagery (harbor, driftwood, backward spine) and a cadence shift at the ending that reweights her stance. Orientation is clean by the laundromat turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman explains "staying while leaving," which narrows Mara's options and charges the final walk. The inferred lens holds, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (palace grounds, tea house, narrator + companions). The piece accumulates pressure through layered ritual—unpacking tools, pruning ivy, planting bulbs, breaking bread—and the ending reweights the opening frame ("Each season, we will uncloak") with a cadence shift that deepens the stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the group commits to cyclical return with tenuous absolution, foregrounding attention and repetition as the cost. One deduction: the ending drifts toward theme summary rather than a charged final image, softening the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (records chief), where (frozen library), and the vow-measurement task by the opening paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the three projections build density and the narrator's own unmeasured vow returns in the final third to deepen the stake. Closure reads as Charged Poise—"we stay, and in the quartz hush we measure and remember"—crystallizing the choice to persist with felt cost (uncertainty, exhaustion, the risk of failure). The cost is legible in "I do not know how long we can hold the passing back" and "meaning keeps arriving like weather," but lacks a sharper before/after image. Escalation is modest—one meaningful deepening when the narrator tests their own vow—sufficient for the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Anchors land early (pirate market, tide, watch fob). The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered silence, false starts, and the fob "inhaling tiny collisions" until the belt-buckle confession crystallizes the betrayal's sound. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she walks away with proof, forecloses revenge, and keeps the hush—visible cost in renouncing confrontation. The "ribbon of moonshine for the dead" and his refusal to share lock the guilt's outline. One meaningful deepening (the buckle moment) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (bluff, aurora, narrator's dust-glow). The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—pollen votes, flavor-as-map—and holds it through the convergence and weather-release ritual. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the carriers spill their skies, the aurora writes it back, duties are set down, and the narrator walks home "tasting the future." Cost is conceptual (debt cleared, next promise pointed to) but remains oblique; the final image reweights the premise without a sharp before/after in the narrator's stance or options. The lens is coherent, but the reconfiguration's felt price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (artist, cave, post-laughter) and sustains an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through discovery (painting → shelf → key → niche) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where drawing Lio becomes the act that "rectifies" creative paralysis. The cost is felt in "the blankness frightens me in the honest way cliffs do" and visible in the trembling wrist, the packed book, the key worn as commitment. One minor causality slip: the lock is "broken" yet the "spindle inside has snapped" is only asserted after the combination is tried, creating a brief opacity about why the attempt was never going to work mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered imagery (glass lungs, irrigation spines, the Ear's acoustic metaphor) and the closure unit achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when voices "deferred until someone honest enough" are released. The map-piecing method provides causal linkage across beats, and the final image reweights the premise (words weren't lost, only held). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third. Cost is felt conceptually—candor as payment—but the price remains abstract; the protagonist doesn't forfeit a live option or relationship on the page, which keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (post-words world, kinetic sculpture assembling meaning through sensory density) and holds it to closure. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (whispering bluff), and conceptual when (after words) by the second paragraph. The iceberg fragment's arrival and its melting provide one meaningful tightening: water falling into reed channels deepens the sculpture's effect, and the aurora thickens again. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the bells kept vigil... They would hold the color of wonder for as long as hearts needed," with conceptual cost (the fragment will melt, its memory will ring inside the metal). However, the cost remains somewhat abstracted—no specific character path is foreclosed on the page, only a general replenishment of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: android, dome, roses, magnetic shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern (shift cresting, dome protesting, breach opening) and deepens via recurring motifs (fire, maps, inner hiss). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the android steps through breach, plants the first packet, and the hiss "loosens...turned, a river choosing deeper banks"—a decisive reweighting with felt cost (dome slumps, paint curls, museum tour ends). One tightening suffices at this length; the breach moment forecloses return and crystallizes new geography.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (courtyard gathering, multiple voices) and converges on a single closure unit: opening the mailbox and reading Maria's letters aloud. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (courtyard, thrift-store curator, locked mailbox). One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's half-moon piece unlocks the padlock, and the letters reweight the courtyard's grudges. However, the cost at closure is diffuse—"grudges softening"—and the conceptual repricing (listening heals) is stated rather than felt in the final image. The piece holds its lens but the closure lacks the sharp undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens early—lyric pattern-building through coded entries and dance—and holds it through closure when "the web finishes itself" and the hidden city lifts. Orientation anchors (sunken lab, flooded corridors, protagonist and Neri) arrive promptly. The escalation operates via density increase and cadence shifts rather than causal reversals, and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the State will read routine notes while revolt sings beneath). One substantive tightening occurs when the daemon learns the new instinct and the tanks exhale, foreclosing the old order. Cost is conceptual and social—the journals will be read as simple notes by those who don't know the dance—but the image makes that cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (whale, crystals, gravity pockets, coffee grounds) and the final altar-building ritual reweights the opening stillness with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who (Ilya), where (harbor/chamber/whale), and when (after the beaching) by the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the town "remember[s] itself by the shore"—but the cost remains oblique; no specific forfeiture or visible trade-off marks the ending, only atmospheric charge. Causality is elliptical but taught early via the coffee-ground spiral and gravity-pocket logic, and the piece sustains its pattern to the end without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (brook, wing, hush) and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (hush achieved, code dispersed, haven restored to ordinary quiet) but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or altered option is shown on the page, only assertion that the prophecy "lost its way." The final image reweights prior material but lacks the on-page felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (garden breathes like a library, meteors as punctuation) and holds it through closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's promise to "practice hospitality for quiet structures" crystallizes a stance with relational cost (ongoing commitment to carry sugar and questions). The seal's impression "cooling on my wrist like borrowed authority" makes the conceptual cost—accepting responsibility for translation—legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator speaks a small truth to the building and it sighs in recognition, narrowing the stance from observation to participation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator becomes a threshold, allowing Reina's laugh to pass through with visible cost ("my fear once nested" replaced by "a small bravery humming"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (velvet garden, twilight, archive keeper). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through resonance structures, culminating in the shell's harmonization and the protagonist's transformation. One meaningful deepening (the question "Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?") narrows options and the final image reweights the quarantine premise. Cost is legible: the narrator shifts from keeper to passage, altering their role permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered reflection and ritual action toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the protagonist chooses not to touch the hinge in their own name). Orientation anchors arrive early (sanctuary, aurora, stalactites). The closure effect is legible and the cost—leaving one door closed—is present, though the felt weight of that renunciation could be sharper. One meaningful deepening (the guild chains slackening, then the personal hinge left untouched) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the singer descends, learns through progressive layers, confronts the council, and releases the trapped voices. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when emerge slowly across the first third without early spatial grounding, triggering a −0.4 penalty. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the canyon "learns how to change," voices return, the singer shifts from seeking to teaching), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than a single legible forfeiture or decisive change that reweights prior stakes on the page. The nexus discovery and council confrontation unfold in summary-tell mode rather than dramatized beats, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator lifts the globe as "direction, not proof yet, but path," crystallizing the mission with felt cost in the final lines. The piece accumulates density through layered dream-fragments, the shrine encounter, and the promise to expose the owner's lie, building to a cadence shift in the final paragraph that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the girl's name is revealed and spoken, narrowing options from investigation to advocacy.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the community learns a gentler knot, the philosopher's wage becomes "to appreciate hidden effort," and the whisk dries with "bristles remembering the foam's brief constellations." One meaningful deepening occurs when the whistle reveals the widow, then the teaching scene reweights the net-mending from theft to mercy. Cost is legible: the widow's apology, the elders' ache, Li's sardine pouch waved away. Orientation is clear early. One micro turn (discovery of the widow) sets up closure without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: narrator arrives → investigates → assembles letters → learns the truth → confronts Klay → decides what to write. One meaningful tightening occurs when the diamond's true function is revealed, narrowing the narrator's options from "debunk a curse" to "expose an engineering cover-up or protect the caretaker." Closure is Charged Poise: Klay's question "if I could leave the names out" crystallizes the ethical stakes, and the narrator's agreement reconfigures the initial debunking mission with felt cost (complicity in the lie). The cost is legible in "dust began to build at the orchard edge," signaling the fragility of the arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece anchors who (narrator at observatory), where (stormlit tower above clouds), and basic situation (broadcasts inspiring resistance) early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (lightning, portico, frequencies, council attack) and a cadence shift at the confrontation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final collaborative broadcast and the conceptual repricing of "ancient shadows" as blueprints, but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, injury consequence, or tactical narrowing charges the final image. The council "blinks" without dramatized consequence, and the ending's declaration of intent ("keep singing," "steer by thunder") lacks the felt price required for high-band RR.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist promises to carry bridges across seasons, reweighting the initial exile from his mother into a vocation with visible social and relational cost (remaining in the loft, living on traded syllables). Orientation anchors early (loft beneath dunes, dawn, vagrant poet). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through the storm beat, three uncorked jars braid the night, and the widow's recognition charges the final exchange. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the question of redemption, then the widow's gratitude answers it. Cost is legible: isolation, physical risk, and the irreversible gift of the jar. Minor tension: the reflective passages occasionally assert meaning rather than letting image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the protagonist, Charged Poise for the Collector); the final line reweights trust and cooling metal as an earned repricing of guardianship. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line 6. The hum sequence constitutes one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake (protect the artifact vs. grant absolution), and the Collector's withdrawal forecloses theft with visible emotional cost. Cost is legible in "eyes cleared by a labor no coin could buy" and the protagonist's locked vault, though the internal price for the narrator remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by line 2 (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, village). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (viaduct mechanics, moon schedule, council resistance) and culminates in a cadence shift when the village adopts the practice and "patience acquires a body." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator's patient revolution succeeds, reweighting the dominant stake (speed versus patience) with visible social cost (the compact, three-night trial, altered village rhythm). The turn at the council demonstration narrows options meaningfully. One modest deduction: the middle third recounts the demonstration and expedition in summary mode rather than dramatizing the peak beats, which slightly flattens the escalation curve even as the closure itself remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the protagonist steps into her own signal, committing to the unredacted report with visible career cost and social consequence (union rep, journalist). The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through layered investigation beats, and the final image reweights the opening ("tunnels can lead somewhere other than work") with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (investigator, tunnel, post-drought) arrive by line four. One meaningful deepening—discovery of the contractor's identity and hidden walkway—narrows options and forces the defiant stance. The piece stays within a single POV and one extended scene; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the chaplain crystallizes a plan (apprenticeship, proceeds to counseling, letters without claiming forgiveness) that reconfigures the parole question from abstract mercy to concrete action with legible cost—Hector's labor over time, the chaplain's professional stake. The drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: the broken heart → repair → melody → apprenticeship plan forms a motivated chain. Orientation is clean by the opening beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the heart's repair becomes the template for the board proposal.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens by ~25% (kaleidoscope fragments, acid sea, yearning algorithm) and maintains it through the bell-ringing climax. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell rings, no one hears, and new directions emerge—cost is oblique but present in the line "most unlonely moment of my life" and the inward-braided map. Orientation anchors (Sera, floating workshop, acid sea) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arrow tip slots into the bell, reweighting prior scavenging into destiny. Minor dock: causality is elliptical (legend → clue → bell) rather than because/therefore, fitting the accumulative design but making the closure feel more ordained than earned by protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (who, where, what). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: recurring numbers build pressure through pattern and density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). The protagonist's choice to "leave the numbers to work" forecloses the export path with felt cost—Lia remains un-recovered yet "not entirely missing." Causal linkage is tight: lie → vault access → voice notes → decision to withhold. Cost is legible in "the smallest impossible thing" and the final bus ad callback.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the protagonist standing in the seam between promise and action, holding the globe, about to walk toward the fracture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the globe accepts the envoys' promises contingent on the protagonist's follow-through, reweighting mediation from neutral observation to ankle-deep participation. Cost is legible: "the new gravity that comes after a decision actually costs something" and the walk into slush. Minor causality slip: mirrors "remember" and "oblige" without clear mechanism, but the pattern is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure operates as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the narrator postpones again, choosing continued trawling over the clinic, a refusal that forecloses the initial path with felt cost ("I am still a euthanasia tourist"). Orientation anchors early (drift-ice marina, post-storm, waiting period). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through災害 work discoveries (crate of tapes, photograph, ice crack saving the boy) until the cadence shifts in the final paragraph to reweight "learning the sound of approaching endings" from death-seeking to life-sustaining vigilance. One meaningful deepening is clear when the boy-rescue moment teaches her that "endings travel with us like luggage." Cost is legible: she remains in liminal suspension, her "loose grip" now stabilized by disaster work rather than resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who (sentinel), where (pavilion/vineyard), and when (after final bus) by the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through wine-parallel beats, the burned letter reappears with reweighted meaning, and the traveler's phone call crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the bridge is unlatched, cost implied in the walk toward new breath and the sentinel's continued solitude). Cost is legible in the sentinel's gift of the letter fragment and the traveler's departure, leaving the sentinel "kept" by vines and owls. One tightening—pouring into soil, then the call—reshapes the dominant stake (nurturing understanding) with felt consequence. The libation beat and phone-call loop provide clear causality under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (pavilion murmurs, kinetic parapet, clearings) that culminate in a final resonant reconfiguration where "the hinge between speech and shelter learn our names." Orientation anchors (dunes, pavilion, narrator and Lio) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the task and reconfigures the relationship between preservation and listening with felt pressure. Cost is present but oblique: the narrator's dream of "clearings opening like courteous doors" implies ongoing labor rather than a sharp, legible price paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo "touched the woman's question" and "steadied the child's laughter," reweighting the abstract task into embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered image-work (spiral → corridor → wing), and the final span reweights collective memory with quiet resonance. Orientation anchors arrive early (lavender field, factory ruins, dawn). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community stands inside the wing and "footsteps translate fear into a soft percussion"—but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or decision that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by line 4 (shadowed library, dawn, reticent scholar). The piece accumulates pressure through echoes mapped to ivy grammar, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "after the last dictionary is printed the library becomes a garden of ears" reweights the premise, and the custodians' lowered eyes signal conceptual cost (authority yielding to care). One meaningful deepening is present; the fractured-sequences method builds to the testimony. Cost is legible: he offers "not a harvest, only a method," foreclosing certainty. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: fog, statues, chalk marks, and recorder accumulate pressure through patterned repetition until the final bloom reweights the dominant stake (capturing age as sound). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the prophet obeys his chalk command, hears "a harbor, the home he could not remember yet," crystallizing the cost of his perpetual leaving. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrows shift and "knowledge evaporat[es] before the forgetting even arrived," tightening the stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts that "leaving and staying can be one motion," a stance crystallization with felt cost (longing persists, but the repair allows continuation). The accumulative/textural lens holds—pressure builds through layered images (spinning hand, thermal tides, Lina's departure) and resolves via the cameras capturing ephemeral movement. One meaningful tightening occurs when the governor seats and the hand settles. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, timing dome, Earth below) arrive within the first third and remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure with Causal support). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening beats. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ruth's "flawless goodbye" crystallizes with visible cost (the shard reweighted, sisters reunified, the chord stopped clean). The rooftop journey and Lena's arrival provide causal escalation that narrows options and charges the final image. Cost is legible in Ruth's acceptance and Lena's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who (rune scholar), where (observatory), and the altered-reality context by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual layering (polish lenses, lace pathways, scratch runes), and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist shifts from seeking extraction to practicing humility, with cost legible in the refusal and the ribbon-seal. One meaningful deepening (discovery that shadows rehearse return) tightens the stake. The causal chain holds under this lens, and the closure image reweights the opening question with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (reed body, tooth, sap map, fox healing) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator's stance shifts from clinical skeptic to listener who repairs both bones and belief. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (narrator identity, river decoy, garden door). The closure lands with cost: the narrator carries the boy home and offers the father both tooth and apology, acknowledging the winter misjudgment with visible humility. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tooth opens the hedge and reveals the boy, reweighting the dominant stake from mystery-solving to relational repair. Minor causality question: the garden's mechanics (why it borrowed the boy, how the tooth functions as key) are taught through poetic assertion rather than dramatized discovery, but the Accumulative lens permits this.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The pearl discovery offers a potential turn, but the presented dilemma—keep/quiet vs. release/storms—dissolves without on-page cost: the protagonist simply "set the pearl among the sea glass" and both outcomes blend into harmony. No visible price is paid; the ending describes villagers harmonizing and the pearl brightening "by being shared," which reads as convenient resolution rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure image is evocative but lacks the undeniable pressure or foreclosed path required for RR or CR.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of repurposing and grafting by the first third, then deepens through repeated acts (stringing the pendant, sewing moss, placing trays, bringing cuttings). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes the narrator's stance ("hands steady, and a hush so honeyed the lens cannot manufacture it") with visible cost—choosing daily labor over immediate public confession, accepting that "sweetness hurts" but turning it toward sustenance. Orientation is prompt (narrator, moss garden, post-confession timeframe anchored in opening lines). One meaningful deepening: the pendant shifts from "bribe…for silence" to "tender metronome," reweighting the stake. Cost is legible on the page: forgoing the camera's validation, enduring "protected vulnerability," and committing to incremental work that may not carry fear "without breaking its stem."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (pages as river, cameos as minnows) and holds it through closure, where the protagonist solemnizes abandoned drafts and releases their shapes upstream—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors ("only place left," "inside the whisper of closing pages") arrive promptly and the metaphoric geography remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the girl refuses mercy-as-erasure and hands over the star, tightening the protagonist's obligation. The cost is felt—kneeling, confessing brevity, carrying shapes as lanterns—but remains abstract; no concrete choice is visibly foreclosed on the page, only a stance crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (moon, bells, vine, song) and a cadence shift at "the arbor answered with a single shiver" reweights the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community commits to renewed practice with the promise "we will meet tomorrow...when everything aligns inside their breath." Orientation anchors arrive late—"verdant arbor at dawn" names place but "Lio" and "the village" remain abstract; specific who/where emerges past the 120-word mark without deliberate disorientation payoff, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The cost is implied (ongoing duty, daily renewal) but not visibly paid on the page; the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and why she's here emerges gradually through散fragments, with "flash-paper alchemist" and her mother's songs arriving late. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-dense, layered imagery building toward a final map-reading—but closure is a Charged Poise at best: she "tucked the map into her coat" and "trudged east." Cost is oblique (leaving the tripod, the implicit prior years of searching) rather than felt in the final image. The ending reconfigures stillness into "road she could finally call home," but the reconfiguration lacks on-page friction or visible price paid in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed and impressionistic: "marble cavern," "wounded season," and a workshop are named but spatial and temporal anchors remain vague past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (harvesting echoes, calibrating the mechanism through lyric density), yet closure lacks a decisive turn or reconfiguration with visible cost—the timer "begins," the locksmith leaves with labeled jars, but no option is foreclosed and no stance crystallizes with felt price. The piece teaches a patterned compression early (daisy of marks, chime-and-echo beats), but the ending delivers completion rather than reweighting or closure cost, reducing the final effect to summary. Causality is present in the repair sequence but does not tighten or deepen meaningfully after midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. Closure reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise—"I accepted the circle" crystallizes the stance—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible on the page. The piece accumulates images (whalebone, shingles, calcified grief) and declares a binding choice, yet I cannot point to an exact sentence where the price of staying is felt rather than described. One meaningful deepening occurs when the valley figure lays down its burden, but the closure image drifts into abstract declaration ("freedom here is a circle") without a concrete sensory or emotional anchor that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as closure: she forecloses spectacle and accepts ongoing grief transformed into portable ritual. Orientation anchors early (widow, loft, rain, kettle). The piece teaches its pattern of interleaved craft-beats and memory by the first third, holds the lens throughout, and the final image—pocketing the cage, drinking the lesson—reweights "here and gone" with undeniable cost (permanent loss balanced by portable memorial). One meaningful deepening occurs when she places mane and crystal inside the carved cage, crystallizing the dominant stake of shaping loss into livable form.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the lagoon's echoes and the camera wheel's clicks build density toward the final shudder and paddle-catch. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the carousel acknowledges and resumes motion—with conceptual cost (the ghost's warning accepted, the vow spent). Orientation anchors by line three (Mara, pontoon, post-halt lagoon). One minor causality slip: the ghost's acceptance feels abrupt after its refusal stance, though the vow-payment bridges the gap adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through Mara's layered technical work (rerouting panels, threading tubing, tuning resistance) and culminates in the fountain's activation and the evening's quiet opening. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the terminal glows, townspeople drift in, and Mara outlines future paths—reconfiguring the space from abandonment to potential with conceptual cost (the modest scale, the uncertain "tomorrow"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the single-POV, two-location structure (concourse and atrium) coheres. One minor causality gap: the sextant piece's role in aiming the beam to wake the sensor feels abrupt and under-explained, slightly loosening the technical chain.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (making peace with the abandoned dream). Orientation anchors are present early (archives, sanctuary, forecourt). The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist reunites with the dream by accepting its transformation into a lullaby the hush can hold, with visible cost (the anthem rusts, the bell does not ring). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tremor answers and "the sanctuary did not flinch," crystallizing the new terms of peace. Cost is legible: "I realized the dream I abandoned had not been the bell but the listening it required."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational overlay. Orientation anchors (narrator, skiff, canal, dawn) land within 120 words. The piece accumulates evidence—scratches match ledger initials, crates confirm fraud—and the closure crystallizes in "We poled away while paperwork crossed town like a weather front," a Charged Poise where the cost (exposure, retribution risk) is felt and options reconfigure. One meaningful deepening: the sundial's scratches reveal deliberate timing of the flood. Cost is visible in the watchman's morphine-pawned badge and the narrator's choice to leave evidence in plain sight, inviting pursuit. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors immediately (dock, snow, fog, harbor). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discovery (knot messages, tar-sealed sprig, translation into new knots) until the final image of seeds planted and the fisherman's promise reweights the opening premise. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the rope lies lighter, memory multiplies, the living sentence awaits planting. Cost is conceptual and relational: the dock's survival now depends on the fisherman's advocacy, and the protagonist leaves with seeds, not certainty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (quay, palace steward, shadowed garden), satisfying the test. The closure unit—planting seeds and stitching the map until "absence grows intimate with mercy"—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: staying without leaving, choosing continuation over flight). However, the cost remains oblique; the narrator's "staying does not halt travel" reframes the premise but the forfeit or price paid is implied rather than dramatized in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs mid-piece when Mira's letter confirms her husband will not return, reweighting the stakes from anticipation to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (bedraggled prince), where (suspended palace on stalactites), and stakes (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical law) within the opening lines. The story accumulates pressure through the egg's discovery, cradle assembly, Keeper demands, refusal, hatching, and song-driven recalibration of the court—one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "tending the cracked cradle we called a palace, teaching our song to breathe onwards" crystallizes the stance with felt cost (the hatchling bears the same compromise, survival with music). Cost is legible on the page in the final image of ongoing, unresolved labor.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The piece accumulates grafting beats and coin-note imagery toward a final image that reweights "scars can sing" with kelp-drift peace and tide-song. Orientation anchors (obsidian lagoon, narrator as firefighter, arsonist's father) land by ~15% and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy hears the throat-note and his wrapped forearm relaxes—micro turn that charges the closure. Cost is conceptual (forgiveness "without forgetting") rather than a visible forfeiture; the final image reconfigures the father's heat and narrator's restraint into shared breath and hum, meeting the RR standard with felt pressure even if opportunity cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the box opens, memories fly out, fountains run, and the protagonist wraps the emptied box "so the city would remember where to look next time"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the cycle with visible cost (the city must find it again). Orientation anchors early: luminous skeptic, city of forgotten fountains, waiting from the pause of geese. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumb trail builds density, sidereal patience deepens the wait, and the constellation-key moment provides the decisive intensification. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Heron star aligns with the statue's shadow, narrowing the method to a single instant. Cost is legible: memories scatter, some orphaned, the protagonist releases his own rather than keeping it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (gears, light, petals) and deepens through the stranger's arrival and the orrery rebuild, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the interval between them becomes wide enough to plant trust"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (nebula garden, narrator role, helium flowers). Cost is felt—"escape had become their only tradition" reweights prior material—but the final pledge and departure read more as thematic resolution than a choice that narrows options with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece braids lines and voices across multiple evenings, teaching its mosaic early, and the closure—loosening the braid so gaps can glow—reweights the dominant stake (collective grief's shape) with visible cost (letting go of tight control). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One slight pressure wobble: the shift from "no edge" to "let it fall open" feels slightly under-motivated within the scene, relying on the grandmother's poem rather than an on-page dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (tower ritual, pause-creates-vision, father's death, inscribed handle) and lands Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the protagonist adjusts the bob, promises to "count even the kindnesses that hurt," and the town will "forgive by inches." Orientation anchors appear by line 8 (tower, winder, tide ritual). Cost is legible in the protagonist's refusal of self-absolution and the tactile ritual of pellet removal. One transition from present ritual to memory and back is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening: Rowan, cemetery, night ritual. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density and pattern accumulation reweight the stakes—but the closure unit is faint: Rowan runs the chess clock and exits, leaving "uncharted echoes thinned, not vanished." This reads as a minor cadence shift rather than a decisive reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost. The final image ("velveteen gloom suits certain truths") is thematically resonant but does not reweigh prior material with visible or felt cost on the page. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence at the ending beat shows Rowan paying a price or foreclosing an option.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors who (ignorance cartographer), where (obsidian spire, frozen lake), and when (before writing) by the opening lines. The closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator and Council "attend to uncertainty as to a teacher" and honor "where we cannot see," crystallizing a stance with undeniable pressure even though the pen has not yet touched the page. The cost is conceptual—choosing humility over omniscience, trellis over wall—and the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Council's fear softens and they agree to the trellis model. However, the causality is more dialogic and reflective than plot-driven, and the exact sentence where cost is legible is diffuse: the spire "thrumming," the lake's "silver sigh," and the collective "attending to uncertainty" all gesture toward consequence without a sharp, irreversible on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered actions (tuning radio → copying phrases → raising dust figures → keying reply → teaching seams), culminating in a final cadence shift: "kept the dial tuned, cloaked nothing, and let the songs teach what silence forgot." Closure reads as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: Mara's refusal to hide the broadcast forecloses personal safety and opens community exposure, reweighting the dominant stake (resistance to story famine) with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear by the second sentence (Mara, copyist, wintered valley, ember alcove). One tightening occurs when the signal falters and she answers openly, narrowing her options and raising stakes for the gathered community. Cost is legible in "cloak nothing" and the implication that "the hills would carry it farther than any bell"—exposure is now inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of ash-scattering ritual early and pays it off at closure when the ash is scattered into the mask's cracks, reweighting "safety" as a shared mirage carried in broken things. Orientation anchors (narrator, gallery, tonight) land by line 1; the rocking chair provides a tactile clock. One meaningful deepening occurs when the drawing becomes ash and is folded into the porcelain—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost (ephemeral image destroyed, grief internalized in the broken object) is legible. The accumulative pressure coheres through the ritual frame without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors early (post-plague flooded city, sewer-dwelling narrator, chronometer salvage quest). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern accrue through layered imagery (oil, sediment, rust-into-legend) and the stakes deepen via the protagonist's mapping and teaching rather than a single causal turn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the night had coordinates again" restores navigation not through drama but through brass, salt, and children's diagrams, forecloses the path of faction dependency, and the final image ("until the clocks stop or the children stop asking why") reweights prior material with quiet, felt cost. One micro-turn (the decision to give copies but keep the cog and method) tightens options without breaking the textural accretion. Cost is legible: isolation persists, dependence on children's curiosity is fragile, applause is refused.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (autumn library, choir teacher, students). The closure—lifting the rosette to the window, letting the pattern appear on the wall—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the moment crystallizes communal possibility with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Reza and the nurse acknowledge their carried fears and sing together. Cost is felt (the mechanic's frown, the nurse's hesitation) but remains somewhat oblique; the final image reweights prior material without a sharp before/after that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (greenhouse at dusk, celestial alignment at midnight, rusted setting) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, ritual preparation, and the seed's awakening, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where community-as-trellis and ritual care crystallize the rebellion's future form. Cost is legible in the traded memory, Kye's tears as irrigation, and the forfeiture of safety for beauty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed sprouts and its first leaf delivers the taste of rebuilt libraries, reweighting the stakes from personal to communal. The pattern holds without contradiction, though causality between planetary alignment and sprouting rests on stipulated magic rather than earned mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who (toll keeper), where (tower), and when (after blackout, nectar dusk) by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (dry fountain → harp → coil → sky writing cursive) and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the tower remembers its vocation, the keeper commits to the craft of wonder-preservation with visible cost ("words tasted like something sweet a hive might save"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the brass coil catalyzes the harp's song, reweighting all prior particulars. Cost is legible: the keeper's compulsion isolates him ("nuisance at markets") and his treasury is "strange," yet he persists.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early and accumulates pressure through ritualized object-placement that deepens the house's "conversation." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the house and narrator "agree to keep each other company"), with the orris and hush carried back to the water as a final image. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeit or altered tactic on the page. The orientation is clean, the lens holds, but the closure effect is more tonal shift than legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through cascading revelations and image layering. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesces slowly across the first third—but the underwater garden setting and telepathic statue POV become legible without breaking comprehension (waiving the Orientation Test penalty). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city softens, nuance walks in, the garden welcomes. However, the cost remains abstract; no specific forfeiture or visible price is pointed to in the final image. The lens holds, but closure lacks the sharp felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the staircase functions as a recursive frame where proofs, dice rolls, and texture-seeking build density until the final theorem crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost—"the machine that turns because not turning would break what little remains unbroken"—and the dice are pocketed, foreclosing escape. The rupture-seam moment at midpoint deepens pressure by returning Tuesday's voice, reweighting the proof from abstract to visceral. Orientation is anchored early (infinite staircase, Tuesday as None, dice choice), and the pattern of proof-by-ascent is taught and paid off at closure. One persistent constraint (the staircase itself) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern—strangers arrive, recognize lost-language inscriptions, reciprocate with gifts—that coheres across multiple beats and deepens through density increase. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (who, where, when). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final palm-glyph "keep" crystallizes Anya's stance and the ledger of kindnesses charges the ending image with felt cost (nightly labor, patience, faith in strangers). One persistent constraint shapes tactics: the moon-tipped brush works only via moonlight, limiting when she can write. The accumulative design holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the museum transforms from ark to stage, reweighting memory's role from preservation to performance. Orientation anchors by line 2 (grotto city, waterfall, museum guide). The story traces a single meaningful deepening—waiting becomes crossing—with visible cost in the cold crossing and the dread that "soften[s] into discipline." One minor causality slip: the beekeeper's map "burned into wax" and his instruction to "wait" are mentioned only in retrospect, weakening the turn's setup slightly but not breaking closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts a permanent role maintaining the counterclock, renouncing rescue for a liminal vigil with felt cost ("every night I fed it a year from my hoard of regrets"). The accumulative/textural lens holds through layered images and a cadence shift at the ending. Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse, rocky island, low tide), and causality flows through reverse-engineering the yoyo → assembling the mechanism → sister's return → binding the apparatus. One meaningful deepening tightens the stake from impossible rescue to sustainable rendezvous with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered imagery (mirrors, clasp, photo booth) and cadence shifts toward the climactic flash. Orientation anchors who (cursed photographer), where (funhouse), and when (after resuscitation) within the opening lines. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist leaves "unafraid," the door open, with the clasp and strip grown warm—options reconfigured, fear unraveled through confession. Cost is legible: exposure of hidden love, vulnerability to the predator, emotional toll of shame. One structural seam: the advisor's unmasking ("only the last trick of fear") arrives without prior dramatic setup, creating a micro-causality gap that slightly weakens the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across multiple paragraphs without deliberate disorientation serving closure, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build toward the wave's passage, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ring becomes a "corridor," pressure reads "as music, not conquest"). Cost is implied—relief, scent, posture loosening—but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure; the wave "passed through" feels more like atmospheric completion than decisive change or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through pattern repetition ("pattern languages"), sensory density, and motif recurrence (whistle, watchers, shells) toward a final cadence shift where the protagonist learns the expedition "was braided into the paths" and reorients the city's passages. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing): the cartographer accepts the teacher's absorption into the city's navigation and returns "oriented" rather than safe, foreclosing rescue but opening new routes with felt cost. Orientation anchors by line 3 (who, where, when). One minor slip: the watchers' answer mechanism ("arranging the glare, shadow knitting itself into hexagons") is asserted rather than causally prepared, but the ending image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (platform, Mara, satchel, purpose), and the piece sustains a situational lens through accumulation of archival detail. However, the closure unit—agreeing to publish the ledgers—lacks on-page decisive change or visible cost; the shift from "rescue" to "build" is announced by Tomas rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options or imposes sacrifice. The causal chain (illuminated letter → cipher → parallels → brick → ledgers → neighbors → publication agreement) is legible but largely procedural, and the final promise ("rescue truth from any pit of lies") reads as thematic recap rather than a reweighted stake or charged image. Cost is conceptual but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the surveyor's ritual accumulates density through recurring images (inkwell, notes in mortar, algae as pennants) and a steady cadence that reweights preservation as both archive and self-erasure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he commits to becoming "less man than listening notation," accepting the cost of ongoing dissolution into the city's memory. Orientation anchors clearly (submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge window, surveyor role) by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers S.G.'s prior note, linking his act to a lineage and charging the final commitment with conceptual cost—yet the cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator stamps four final notes and repositions the chalk arrow, crystallizing a commitment to truth over rage with visible cost (restraint, methodical honesty). The escalation reads as density increase—pattern recognition of the serrated crescent deepens stakes from catalog work to exposing forgery. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (narrator, library, blackout, assignment). One meaningful tightening occurs when genuine versus counterfeit crescents are tested, narrowing options and reweighting the dominant stake with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric-mosaic pattern early (fragmented vignettes unified by the lantern-maker's voice and the grief motif) and sustains it through to closure. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow's return reframes the grief as a quest for balance rather than loss) with felt cost: the torment shifts but remains "luminous," and the protagonist commits to perpetual transformation rather than resolution. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (floating island, tea garden, glass basilica). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cranes are released and the shadow returns, reweighting the protagonist's understanding of what was sought. Minor penalty: the middle third loops several descriptions of gem-polishing and dream-recording without a clear escalation beat between the decision to fold cranes and their completion, creating a sense of stasis before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent; the piece builds density through layered imagery (geode, salt flats, interferometer readings) and reaches closure via Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis when the narrator refuses extraction and locks the coordinates, foreclosing institutional approval with visible professional cost ("the institution will hate us by morning"). Orientation anchors by line 4 (floating observatory, salt flats, survivor status). The causality is light but sufficient under this lens: the hunt sequence structures pressure, the valley discovery triggers memory, and the refusal to harvest is motivated by the geode's symbolic weight and the narrator's need to "leave a wound unharvested." Cost is on the page: professional consequences, defiance of the grant/board, and the crystallized posture in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonance through the matrix chip, star trails, and pauses-as-map motif, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (belonging is the margin, not the letter) with conceptual cost made legible in the final image of coordinates plotted from blanks. Orientation anchors are delayed—who/where/when clarify only after the opening dusk image—but the effect supports the lyric tone and does not obscure closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip "can only cast the spaces that hold [letters]," reweighting the quest. Cost is conceptual and felt, though never a physical forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the narrator writes Mara, refuses to profit, and commits to stand at the terrace—a renunciation that forecloses the black-market path. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (cobalt terrace, dusk, genealogist). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrator sifts artifacts (watch hand, driftwood, hair coil) that deepen understanding of complicity, culminating in the letter as a pattern-break that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crescent splits and reveals the hair, shifting tactics from abstract guilt to concrete reparation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, stakes). The closure unit—Earned Stasis as Charged Poise—lands on the page: the narrator commits to stewarding "between apology and forgiveness" after dramatizing partial exchange success and logging what failed. The dominant stake (neutral exchange under mutual distrust) tightens when Daro refuses to cross until named with the apology, then releases with visible cost (notes in the ledger, continued tension). Drive lens reads Accumulative with causal threading; the final image ("furrowed hush until those who cross can breathe without armor") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist apologizes on-page, the sister closes the compass lid, and they reframe regret through the utility-pole naming ritual. Cost is felt in the seawater-taste apology and the shift from hoarding to offering. The accumulative lens coheres through repeated navigational motifs (compass, poles, Polaris) that reweight meaning at closure. Orientation anchors promptly (coastal launch, astronomical compass, sister meeting). One micro turn—grounding the kayak—sets up the confession without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (bioluminescent lake, baseball, newspaper-line navigation) and accumulates pressure through confessional exchange and vial-release. Closure arrives on-page when the protagonist pours the lake's glow into the fountain and "felt my ribs open a little and shut, a door practicing its hinges"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost: the protagonist is not absolved, only beginning repair. Orientation anchors (underground lake, post-procedure, boat journey) land clearly. The causal chain from confession to vial to fountain release is motivated under the lens, though the time-traveler's map mechanics remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece opens with clear anchors (orchard, moonlight, narrator's purpose) and builds through spice-scented conjuration to the lovers' reunion as birds. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"two hearts beating like one drum across galaxies, fierce, near"—with the cost of living "between names" made explicit. The fortune's instruction ("Become what hears you best") seeds early and pays off at transformation, charging the final image. One meaningful deepening (reluctant metamorphosis → feathered meeting) suffices for this length, though the phoenix frame and warehouse backstory add expository weight without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist recovers lost minutes, pours them into the handprint, and traces her daughter's hand while whispering promises—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance toward time and parenthood with felt cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ritual layering (cards, cloth, saucer, brooch) and the final cadence shift ("two clocks trying to agree on morning") reweights the opening restlessness. Orientation is secure by the second paragraph (who: cartomancer, where: midnight glade, when: after birth). One tightening occurs when the saucer crack aligns with the palm outline and the path lifts, narrowing her focus to the task of recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator commits to ongoing shadow work and care with the cost made explicit ("promising to stay open so long as we kept doing the work"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered acts (navigation, shadow work, stitching, threshold crossing) that reweight the stake from escape to caretaking. One tightening occurs when the door resists and the narrator must process their own complicity to proceed, narrowing options and raising emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density builds through layered images (ashfall, fumaroles, lightning bugs) and cadence shifts tighten at the rescue. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara recognizes she has "fulfilling prophecies accidentally again," the final image reweights her practice, and "transformation wore her name lightly" reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (she remains unseen, coins spent, footprints vanishing). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One weakness: the prophetic fulfillment and neighbor arrivals lean on orchestrated coincidence to resolve rather than complicate, softening causal pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sentinel becomes "a hinge" on which "the city turned quietly," and the revolution "stayed silent long enough to seed song." Cost is conceptual and felt—the quill holder sacrificed, vigilance softened—legible in the final image of the half-painted sundial wearing "honest" shadows. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through lyric compression, pattern-taught metaphors (locks, hinges, light), and a cadence shift at closure reweighting the dominant stake (permission over toppling). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (fort, twilight, blackout, lock sentinel role). One micro turn when the wheel wakes shifts tactics from stealth to shared light. However, causality occasionally compresses past clarity: how the sundial's "coded angles" direct guards and why the blackout occurs remain asserted rather than dramatized, costing full confidence in escalation mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ritual repetition (stone arrangements, dust gathering, promise recitation) that intensifies through denser sensory detail and closer convergence with "she." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I"—the final image crystallizes the achieved stasis with the conceptual cost of elusive identity now voluntarily embodied ("I am hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak"). The orientation anchors (eel herder, tidal bluff, post-friction world) arrive early enough, and the accumulative pressure holds through the aurora night sequence to the dawn resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The storm, timer, and Mara's folder accumulate pressure toward the final reading, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the words "find their map, crossing out the crossings-out." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The cost is conceptual (defiance of censorship) but remains more asserted than dramatized on the page; the final image resonates thematically without a sharp before/after in Ilya's situation or options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors late: who/where/when clarifies gradually across the first third without teaching disorientation as pattern. The drive lens reads Situational (philosophy-as-duel protocol) but wobbles toward Accumulative in the lyric phrasing; by closure the lens is ambiguous. Closure attempts Charged Poise – the pact sealed by noon, the walk toward gardens – but cost remains abstract: no foreclosed option is named, no prior path visibly abandoned. The sundial-and-needle mechanism works causally to reveal coordinates, but the final departure reads as gentle inevitability rather than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through braided tasks (rebar with ivy, seeds between brick and book) and the final image ("our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library") reweights the opening premise with conceptual cost (trespassers → keepers). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the library's restoration forecloses the vagrant/trespasser path, and the sign "Enter Quietly, Leave Carrying More Than You Brought" crystallizes the new stance with undeniable social cost (defying developers, inviting community scrutiny). One meaningful deepening occurs when the neighbor and others join, shifting the work from two outlaws to a collective claim.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring motifs (clock, compasses, arbor, film reel) layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where color returns to Mara and the couple sits together while "compasses, now still, lay down like tired swallows." Closure lands on the page with felt cost (the clock ticks only four beats, the arbor opens "a path back"), though the cost feels somewhat muted—what the protagonist or Mara gave up to achieve this reunion remains oblique. Orientation is clear early (station, pianist, broken clock, Mara's absence), and the tightening is legible as the film reel opens hidden passages that lead to retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual beats—unpacking instruments, harvesting dreams, planting the seed, reciting the treaty—toward a coherent RR (Charged Poise: the sapling's emergence and the narrator's choice to linger). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ridge "counts" the villagers and some leave (a micro turn that tests commitment), and closure lands on-page with the sapling fruiting and the narrator tasting "recorded contradictions." Cost is conceptual and felt in the phrase "we have chosen what to keep breathing," but the final image leans heavily on metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The lens holds, but the tightening is softer than a high-band accumulative design would require.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through ritual steps (unwrapping compass, crushing berries, cutting juniper, speaking to pool) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the narrator releases words "like seeds" and accepts they "might take root somewhere I would not control"). Orientation is swift (islet, after severance, bonsai tutor). Cost is felt but oblique—the final walk carries regret's weight without a sharp forfeiture. The closure image reweights prior material but stops short of a decisive change in circumstances or a conceptual repricing with undeniable stakes, limiting high-band entry.

Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and closure lands with cost legible in the "receipt that names us caretakers." The moon timetable and patrol car pressure cohere without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the clock-winding and return, under an Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the broken clock shapes tactics. The cost is legible on-page in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is achieved with the seed sprouting and monsoon arrival, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. Cost is legible in the departure of some villagers and the ridge steadying. The drive lens holds throughout, with patterns converging meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the compass points inward, reconfiguring forgiveness as an inner harbor. Cost is legible in the "ache that guided my hands" and the final image of regret tingeing tools. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (memory shards interleaved with present action) is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from immediate post-flood assessment to repair planning to community interface to the reoriented space with children, all under one coherent drive. Each step logically follows from the prior one (reading dust → deciding which panes to replace → writing a specific kind of report → reopening in a constrained way). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the greenhouse will not be restored to a prior ideal, but tuned to “the slope we have,” with visible costs (loss of plants, half-light reopening, acceptance of damage). The before/after is legible and paid for without any causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clean: fire → discovery of ledger/testament → canyon investigation → hidden chamber and kiln → decision to finish the work and reframe it as orientation for others. The accumulative structure (walking, reading, following patterns) supports a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where her role shifts from victim/detective to maker of a new passage. Stakes are primarily conceptual and communal rather than immediate physical, but the attempt on her life and shadow of the smugglers add enough implied risk. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after—she has transformed the attack’s residue into a guide—though the cost remains more inferred than directly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is accumulative, with each vignette (ferry backstory, conservatory work, first performance, bell rectification) tightening the vow-to-make-music-from-silence into concrete practices. Causality is clean under a textural lens: the ferry trauma → vow → conservatory work with Sura → public engagement → city delegates and the bell → re-affirmed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Sura asks if it’s enough and the narrator answers via the charged image of breath constellations on glass, with the cost of living as a survivor still palpable. Orientation and rules of the world are clear early and never contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: package → coordinates-tapping → journey → underwater library problem → repair via self-sacrifice → altered surface world. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the global system of distress signals is mended at the price of the narrator’s permanent entanglement with the Library Below, and the final shop image makes the before/after legible. The drive lens reads as hybrid (causal spine with accumulative texture), held consistently to the end. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues hamper comprehension or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens with a clean causal spine: sanctions → anonymous bell system → Noor/Farid conflict → Mara’s braided run → reconfigured understanding of motive and trust. Orientation is strong from the first sentence (terra-cotta arbor, exile community, sanctions period), and the watchers provide a consistent external pressure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the motive is declared and reweighted (“to build intergenerational support… keep it nameless”), with the bell and note anchoring a before/after in how the group understands giving. The cost—ongoing danger, surrendered credit, and chosen anonymity—is legible, if more conceptual than dramatized in any one perilous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: past-life memory → return to viaduct with new tool (the tear) → ritual with the friend → arrival of the woman → decoding and conceptual shift. Causality is clean within its lyric mode, and the closure—redefining “unused love” and committing to spending breath in attentive kindness—is on the page. Cost is present but relatively soft; the relinquishing of old knots and the obligation to act differently are implied rather than dramatized as a painful trade. Even so, the before/after is legible and the drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the halo, activation of the maze’s temporal memory, and the final offering to the willow form a coherent arc. Causality is strong within a lyric frame—the shard triggers temporal doubling, its pull guides navigation, and its dissolution resolves the trap by reconfiguring the rules of time in the garden. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: time shifts from something to map to an “inward weave,” with the visible cost of sacrificed images and relics. Orientation is solid from the outset (who/where/what she does), and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean and strong: arrow → decoding keys → opening the vault → Collectors’ arrival → her strategic decision to bind them into the work. Orientation (who/where/when, plus the wall coming down) is established early and never wavers, even with lyric density. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she does not escape or “win,” but redefines liberation by choosing shared apprenticeship under constraint, with the chain still literally on her. The cost—remaining bound and ceding exclusive control over the vault—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is accumulative but causally coherent: research in the orchard and forge leads to the decision to burn the oilskin promise, which produces the imprint that enables the final test with the father. The flashback to the original betrayal is cleanly anchored and directly informs the present tactics, not just mood. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the device’s behavior in the conversation reframes both the father’s choice and the narrator’s pursuit, with the cost of living with a clarified, unromantic truth. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the through-line remains legible despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal core: florist’s code → jar activation → encounter at destiny’s door → shared listening → missed train. The closure is an Earned Stasis/DC hybrid: the older self stays and misses the train, the narrator explicitly chooses not to “steal” and reconceives his mission, with cost and relief both legible. World rules (moonbeam jar, codes, destiny’s door) are introduced early and used consistently without retroactive patches. The temporal paradox of meeting an older self is gestured to but kept within the story’s magical premises, so it doesn’t break causality under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural drive: recurring rituals (sweeping, lamp, bookmark, breath-counting, narration) and the surrounding thaw steadily reweight the core stake of creating a safe space for questions. Structural coherence is clear—one continuous session in the control room with a brief, anchored flashback to the “crowded studio”—and closure lands in a Resonant Reconfiguration as inquiry comes to “feel like home.” The causal chain is subtle rather than plotty, but each action (placing the bell over the intercom, writing the note, choosing not to abandon the project when the generator coughs) grows logically from earlier motifs. Stakes stay largely internal and contemplative, which limits the sense of decisive turn, but within a lyric mode the arc is legible and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the contracts → decoding the cast via shell and stars → locating microfilm and ring → luring Kellan to the library → exposing and physically outmaneuvering him. The piece maintains a single coherent present scene with interleaved backstory that always tilts current tactics, keeping the drive legible. Closure combines a decisive external change (evidence projected, Kellan trapped) with an internal reconfiguration of identity and agency. The child’s-cast cipher skirts convenience but is thematically integrated enough that it doesn’t read as a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: fort in crisis → oracle arrives with the booklet → lesson in listening → creation and vocalization of the map → commander’s “out vs. through” question → the booklet empties. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they cannot escape the endless night, only move “through” it by redescribing silence, which is an on-page conceptual cost. Causality is lyric but coherent—each new understanding arises from an embodied exchange or action—and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities. The only thing keeping this just under 9 is that the external stakes (what concretely happens to the fort or coasts) remain abstract, so the cost is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure through loops is clean and coherent: each iteration slightly reweights the janitor’s relationship to ice, sound, and thought. The causal logic of the world (the second chance program, looped timelines, quotas) stays consistent enough to support a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final cadence—accepting duty while redefined as “stewardship” and understanding thoughts as emergent from careful contact—creates a strong before/after in meaning with the ongoing cost of labor and vigilance. The piece holds its drive lens (accumulative/textural with light situational pressure) from early pattern-teaching to the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: rain/forecourt → lens → doodles → discovery of Rell → decision to project → public witnessing and mutual confession. Causality is clear enough under a lightly magical premise; no important setup is dropped, and the closure (they reorient the institution toward unsoftened truth) is on the page. Cost is legible: risking institutional trust and positions to restore a more honest relationship with history. The drive lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout, tightening toward the public projection without structural wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: return to maze → ritual work with marbles → visit from Auditor → test of his practices → closing image of acceptance by the maze. Causality is coherent under a textural lens; each beat deepens the central premise rather than branching. Closure lands when the vine doorway admits him and excludes the Auditor, reweighting the earlier talk of measurable luck and deception. Cost is present in his defiance of the standardized system and the lifelong penance for his earlier lie.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean, single continuous scene with a clear experimental arc: preparation, activation of the nexus, observation of the sideways-time signatures, and a conscious de-escalation. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Hale chooses to let go a little of his drive for proof to protect the flock’s dreams. The cost—sacrificing some data/control for ethical gentleness—is felt but understated, so the climax doesn’t quite bite as hard as it could. No orientation or lens-clarity issues: who/where/when and the story’s logic are all firmly grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: ghostly code → deciphering the warning → rehearsal about to start → protagonist chooses to disrupt → evacuation → mezzanine collapse. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with cost and consequence on the page; the world is not reset, and the before/after is unmistakable. The reflective coda about “in between spaces” feels like a conceptual repricing layered onto that concrete outcome, not a bolt-on. Ghost mechanics (watermarks as code) are introduced early enough and used consistently, so there are no orientation or rule breaches.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight and causal: fever breaks → renewed attention to margins → illustration revelation → graphite weighing → warning call. Closure is on the page and costly: she shifts from complicit silence to active, public warning, with a clear before/after in her stance toward truth and risk. The oracle’s projections and the convoy’s climb give an implicit ticking clock, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups. The final image of her standing at the rail reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise under a Hybrid causal/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: mother’s confession → prior mapping via psychic calls → arrival at the tunnel → decision to turn the beaded valve → descent into the niche → discovery of ledger/tag → reconfiguration of her father’s “disappearance.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, with the ledger’s “hush paid” zeros and the tag in her cheek reweighting the family myth and the phrase “factory ghost shift.” Orientation (who/where/why now) is solid by the second sentence and remains so despite the lyricism. The cost of the new knowledge is legible on-page in her attempt “to appraise what balance I could restore by carrying this truth.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very well handled: the story teaches its pattern early (“Across the drift of untold seasons, I listen and list”) and returns to it at the close with a clear before/after in the keeper’s role. Beats flow coherently from solitary stewardship, to the child, to refugees, to the ceiling crack, with each layer thickening the central pressure of how to hold change. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: endurance gains a new valence when the work shifts from merely recording to actively tending, at non-trivial emotional cost. The only limit is that the stakes stay largely conceptual; there’s no single tightening turn that dramatically narrows options in-scene, so the structural impact is powerful but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure keyed to the eclipse works cleanly: as the light thins, the ritual deepens from hum to whisper to “mama,” giving a lucid before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they leave with a fragile but real path for Felix’s voice, and the story clearly marks this as a beginning rather than a fix. Causality is soft but coherent; each step grows from prior consent and responsiveness rather than coincidence. The lack of any serious on-page setback or risk of failure keeps the arc from feeling fully stringent at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern early and sustains it: each object (silo, diaries, tapestry, axis) adds another layer to a single drive—reclaiming lost stories after the end of dreaming. Causality is soft but coherent: diaries → hearing specific memories → tapestry as grammar → physical alignment → decision to write. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the act of writing is reframed as restoring the world’s “ear” while letting the walls rest, with the displaced axis understood as a metaphysical listening problem, not just a tilt. The cost is mostly conceptual (the burden of memory shifts to him) rather than dramatized, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: ascent to lighthouse, preparation of the lens, arrivals of the three townspeople, and the message blooming into communal acknowledgment. Causality is coherent—her seeded fortunes lead to their convergence; the microdot booklet teaches the tactic; the light amplifies the message. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s complicity is reweighted from furtive guilt to chosen chorus, with a conceptual cost in stepping into visibility. The stakes and “price” of this shift remain mostly implied rather than dramatized in concrete consequences, which keeps it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a tight single-scene exorcism whose beats accumulate clearly: setup of chapel and vocation → live confrontation with the entity → linguistic “pressure” sequence → conceptual reframe that disrupts the possession. Causality is clean under an accumulative/textural lens: each rhetorical device slightly reweights the demon’s stance until the final question (“If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow”) forces a conceptual break. Closure is strong: the demon loosens, blue thins to water, and the story redefines possession as impossible where questions are commoned. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible: the entity relinquishes its throne-hunger, and the chapel must bear “more weight” to hold this contest.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: ascent of the spire + progressive summoning of an orchestra through mapped memories, under a soft clock (“before exhaustion hits”). Each memory cue (cul-de-sac, radio, blue hour) causally deepens the symphony and her internal reconfiguration, and there’s a coherent before/after: from seeking to conduct to being conducted/held. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final line, with conceptual and emotional cost in surrendering control. The pattern is taught early and maintained, with no orientation or lens ambiguity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: tablet → maze entry → memory tasks/tests → guard confrontation → rule application → decisive fall and exit. The closure unit is a clear Decisive Change: he surrenders his defining ability and exits the reset loop, with a visible new stasis (“kept…only once”) and cost. The structure is coherent despite its lyricism; each surreal test follows from the rules the tablet lays out, and the return to the viaduct at the end ties the pattern tightly. One small limitation is that the mechanics of “procedural generation” and the rules of the fractured timelines remain slightly abstract, relying on vibe rather than concrete constraints, though this doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: descent to the cavern → ritual with the backward tape and filament → return to the classroom with the transformed drum. Causality is clear within the story’s quiet magical realism—Risto’s tools and methods directly enable Lena’s emotional shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to the same role (teacher) with reweighted stakes and newly risky openness, and the cost is implicit in her choice to feel again. There are no orientation issues, and every shard points toward the central before/after of numbness versus re-engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: being followed → courtyard vigil → pigeon message → alliance → vow, each deepening the central question of how to bring “rain truth” out unowned. Structure is cleanly single-scene with one late visitor, no orientation debt, and clear causal throughlines despite the lyric mode. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the narrator commits to a risky, patient route and lets “the wind choose the order of my vows,” reconfiguring waiting from avoidance into charged stance. The cost is conceptual but legible (risk, loss of comfort, ongoing danger) rather than dramatically enacted, hence strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: arrival → setup of the violet and UV lamp → waiting with mounting tension → first scent release → interaction with the vial → realized repricing of grief. Causality is clean at the scale this mode requires: because the narrator brings the vial and the lamp, the plant’s exhalation can “choose” and map those oils, enabling the closure insight. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: opening the vial and saying “I grieve” reframes their past ambush-tears as “mnemonic, precise, and real,” with a visible emotional cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the only limit is that external consequences remain wholly offstage, keeping the arc intimate rather than structurally expansive.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: humming highways → grotto → rope and mural → escapee’s arrival → negotiation with visitors → reconfiguration via poem and braid, culminating in the escapee’s release. Causality under a textural lens is strong—each move (dusting the mural, knotting the rope, braiding it through the whale) grows logically from the narrator’s method and the central problem of the frozen second. Closure lands cleanly with a resonant reconfiguration: the escapee is freed, the whale and rope retain charged memory, and the narrator accepts continued partial blindness as the price of keeping time textured. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never breaks, despite the surreal world.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: hush → solitary tuning → boy’s arrival/fire → communal storytelling and improvised music → discovery and raising of the bell → reconfigured silence. Each beat follows logically, with the mendicant’s bowl and ship ribs providing concrete causal links (catching leaks, ringing with embers, serving as buoy, then enabling the bell’s retrieval). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hush “learns to listen” and coexist with sound, and the community’s options are reweighted from mute aftermath to shared, imperfect music. Cost is legible in the persistent scar of the burned rainforest and the fact that the hush never fully vanishes, only renegotiates its place.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: Liora arrives with a problem, offers the blotter, the narrator works their method, and the counterfeit courage either fractures or ripens—here, it ripens with cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Liora departs changed in her relation to grief and work, and the narrator reaffirms their stance of “affectionate detachment,” aware of its personal cost. Stakes and rules are legible from early on, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities. The before/after line—Liora nearly subsumed by grief vs. able to work while not mistaking the bridge for the shore—is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from the misdelivered envelope to the investigation, to the decision to create the ledger, to its first communal test, and finally to the narrator’s ongoing commitment. Causality is clear and graceful: each beat (“So began our map of cycles of compassion…”, “We decided to test our plan…”) grows naturally from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR in the final recognition that “cargo and music share one truth,” which reframes all prior detail. Cost is subtle but present in the choice of “restraint and persistence” and the implied lifelong labor of maintaining the ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → search ritual → sigil discovery → weaving/dedication → reconfigured status in the community. Cause-and-effect is legible under a textural lens: agreeing to the search leads to the sigil, which then demands a response in the form of the bench and dedication. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s social position clearly shifts from outsider to “woven in,” with cost in vulnerability and offered labor. The throughline never fragments despite the lyric density, and there are no causal or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: pendant → slowed time → sluice-lift → rhythm break → echo birth → ascent to hush-basin → cradle → release, all under the looming constraint of the giant’s nap. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early despite the lyric mode, and the world’s rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the guild watcher’s comment reframes the risk as a finite, necessary window for this species, and the narrator pays by relinquishing control and accepting ongoing time-debt. Stakes are more intimate and conceptual than catastrophic, but they are coherent and feel scaled correctly to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: arrival → ritual setup → orchard’s response → apprentice apparition → reconfigured stance. Each beat arises organically from the ritual logic (glass eyes, mosaic, drip tempo), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: moving from solving loss to scaffolding it, with the cost of living inside that uncertainty. Causality is coherent within the magic system; no orientation issues or unkept setups. It narrowly misses 9+ because the pressure curve is strong but not shockingly incisive at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story’s structure is clean: discover tape → prepare cache → wait for Mara → witness connection, all under a single continuous temporal arc. Causality is intact even in lyric mode: the outage and Mara’s prior search explain both the discovery and her timely arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the narrator shifts from pure infrastructure to acknowledged presence—with emotional cost (risking being seen) legible on the page. The accumulative texture of sensory and archival motifs makes the final lamps “steady” feel like a true before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: early storm-season frame, recurring returns to the trellis, progressive experiments with water and layout, culminating in the gale and post-gale reconfiguration. Causality is soft but present under a textural lens: because storms disrupt schedules, the narrator experiments; because those experiments reveal resilience, their philosophy and tactics change. Closure lands as an on-page conceptual repricing—running the nursery as an act of listening rather than command—anchored in concrete new habits. The cost is implicit but legible (business uncertainty, inherited habits from the father renounced), keeping the before/after line clear.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is coherent and accumulative: brooch → rain-trail following → Mara and the story → chapel and cistern → map → mural and final rain behavior, all in a clean causal chain. Orientation (post–water wars tidal island, insomniac painter) is anchored early without confusion, and the “unearthed convergence” moment in the cistern provides a satisfying hinge. Closure lands via the decision to make the map public as a mural and the final image of rain teaching them, with a clear before/after in communal options. Cost is present but understated—labor, sleeplessness, and risk of hope rather than a sharply dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival → request with the pearl → amplification of ordinary sounds → revelation of the listening shadow → invitation for it to inhabit the vowel. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the shadow becomes a “resident instead of a rumor,” reweighting the cave, the narrator, and the idea of everyday magic. Causality within this lyric mode is coherent—each escalation arises naturally from the last symbolic act. The main limitation is that the cost of accepting the shadow remains more conceptual than felt; we intuit consequence but don’t see a sharply defined foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: rain and return → discovery of the valve → revelation of the misread silence → communal reassembly and the ledger. Causality is soft but clear enough—the valve and its story reconfigure the exile from treachery to warning, enabling a new practice of listening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“ending it is a practice”), with the city’s relationship to signal and silence permanently altered. Stakes and cost are conceptual rather than dramatic, but the before/after—punitive exile vs. accountable listening—is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: dare → following pavement arrows → railyard gate → fortress → offerings → train and passengers, with each beat reweighing the central premise. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands via a clear conceptual repricing: “the fortress kept nothing; it only held the shape of holding.” The cost of entry (personal confessions) is explicitly on the page and shapes the final act of guiding others. There are no orientation issues, and the piece maintains one continuous drive without slack turns.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric/accumulative frame: arrival → ritual with the tile → inclusion of avoided memories → transformed chamber and a reconfigured stance on memory and skepticism. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the city now has a literal/figurative room for honest remembrance, and the narrator has paid a personal price in memory to make it possible. The drive lens (hybrid but ending in accumulative/textural) holds consistently, with the whales’ unheard symphony and the tile’s patterns tightening toward the final chamber. All key set-ups (Estera’s belief, the tile, Lio’s fear) are paid off in the climax and final image without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: rumors → Mara’s arrival → flux-calibrated experiment → Mara’s attempted cancellation → the fragment’s allegiance shift → the narrator’s release. Closure lands cleanly as a decisive change with cost: the curse transfers, the immortal exits the old reality, and Mara is left with the rearranged refuge and fragment. The accumulative lyricism never obscures who is doing what, where, or why, and the final revaluation of “goodbye” reweights the entire piece. A hairline abstraction in how exactly the curse mechanics work keeps it just shy of fully crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean and tight: the need to get Yusef out → the active waiting and ritualized work → the timed move → the hedge sighting and police confrontation → the bluff with certificates → the successful transfer and trade for names. The piece maintains a single through-line in real time, with brief, well-anchored past references that always tilt current tactics. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: Yusef’s survival is secured and the narrator acquires weaponized truth, with cost implied in the future confrontations and risk. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the causal lens holds from start to end.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece clearly operates on an accumulative/textural drive: repeated rituals (lamp, notepad, bonsai walks) accrue meaning and resolve into an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise at the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is solidly in place early, and the pattern of present ritual with embedded recollections is consistent. Closure lands when the narrator reaffirms continuation—“If nobody comes, the bonsai will know where the pages live”—which reconfigures the premise with a quiet but legible cost. The escalation is more a deepening of pattern than a sharp structural turn, which suits the mode but keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: we move from general harbor life and erased records to the poison label, to the barred-window office confrontation, to the alliance with another listener. Causality under a textural lens holds: finding the label → following it → learning the “no one harmed officially” truth → choosing to continue building an off-ledger archive. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts enduring namelessness while doubling down on her alternative system of record with a partner. Stakes and cost are present but stay largely conceptual and emotional, never quite crystallizing into a sharply constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at observatory → ritual with shell/cello → contact with astronomer → turn inward via the compass to the avoided memory → apology and reconfigured understanding. Causality is coherent under a textural lens; each magical element emerges from, and then reshapes, the protagonist’s stated purpose. Closure is strong—a conceptual repricing of the “universal riddle” into a practice of gentle refusal/return, tied to the specific act of retelling the past conversation honestly. Nothing important teleports or resets, and the scene window (dusk through rain) is legible without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: looming privatization → competing demands on parade routing → secret mural plan → confrontation → negotiated pivot, giving solid on-page closure. The foundation chip and graffiti system are introduced early and pay off structurally, not just decoratively. The cost is present but relatively soft—strained trust, reduced finale spectacle, and the risk of angering financiers—rather than a sharply dramatized loss. Still, the ending clearly reconfigures the situation into an earned, precarious new balance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean, continuous accumulative scene from moonlit wait to branded sunrise, with time pressure (approaching dawn, vial warming, mirror deployment) providing spine. Setups (vial mechanism, double mission, consortium mirrors) all pay off in the climax when the message blooms and the narrator must choose how and when to take the final photograph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “there will be no second last” crystallizes the before/after and the cost of commercialization without feeling didactic. Causality is tight under the textural/situational lens; no beats feel vestigial or unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline—drone returns damaged → patch and decode → locate crate → ship can depart—is clear and cleanly staged in a single continuous scene. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with supporting causality, and closure lands in the final reconfiguration of “direction decoded into motion” radiating out into the city. However, the cost of failure and the narrowness of the window remain soft; the anchor’s urgency is more atmospheric than structurally binding. The ending offers a resonant cadence, but the before/after shift hinges more on tone than on visibly altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: wait for the falcon → read condensation → venture onto the ice → locate the throat → return with proof, all under a single continuous temporal arc. Causality is firm enough for a lyric mode (they move only after the falcon, they choose direction via glass and compass, the discovery directly answers the stated goal) and the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the very idea of mapping is inverted (“rivers inked not from mouths to heads but from a single pupil outward”), with the cost of alienating editors and risking the work’s rejection clearly implied. There are no orientation slips or unkept setups; every major early image (falcon, window, kettle, dog-ear) is redeployed or reweighted by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: arrival → demonstration of the method → communal participation → visible rebuilding → the narrator’s final vow. Causality within a lyric, textural lens is strong: the collective stepping pattern, guided by the tuner, produces incremental physical and social repair. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the city shifts from ghost to nascent community, and the narrator assumes an ongoing role—with a felt cost in the need for continual, humble maintenance. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is clear by mid-story and held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: quest for the vial → entanglement and oxygen pressure → tactical unsnarling → acquisition of the vial → transformation of the distress signal into a carrier of memory-hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the signal’s function changes from survival beacon to emotional bridge, with cost embodied in the deliberate stillness and oxygen reduction. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but each image beat clearly follows from the last and narrows options (especially around the net and the time/air constraint). Nothing crucial is left unmotivated; the before/after of what a “distress signal” means is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clear from the opening line and the piece teaches its accumulative, lyric pattern early. The causal thread—lattice → scuffs/door → pantry passage → lantern pit → beam + lattice trapping the hush—holds under a Hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines what “crying wolf” means and conceptually re-prices belief and silence with visible stakes (the missing breathing again). The quasi-mystical mechanics of how light + lattice bind hush are intentionally soft but still legible enough not to break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clear accumulative-lyric arc: tending the orchard → ghost’s appearance and teachings → confession and name-speaking → reconfigured duty. Causality is tight within the mode (bead → song → memory → debt → new oath), and the closure beat—“the debt is paid when you keep paying” plus the narrator’s ongoing tending—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (lifelong obligation). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and there are no dangling setups. The global drive lens is held consistently through to the charged, quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear and satisfying: wharf → canyon entrance → labyrinth fork → inner chamber → return to town, with each step causally arising from the last. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the lighthouse-without-lamp and the town’s relationship to precedent, culminating in the tactile “light” and the rule of listening. The cause-and-effect is clean (plate into wall → seam opens → chamber → embossed book → town’s new practice) and there are no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the cost of the journey remains mostly conceptual; the piece never quite tightens into a felt risk of loss in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the structure is very clean: return → excavation → sundial reconstruction → bread-baking → conceptual revaluation of faith. Each move grows out of the last (finding fragments; restoring the dial; using it to time bread) and tightens the emotional stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: time and faith are “excavated” and rebuilt, with a clear before/after in how the catacomb and the grandmother’s bones are perceived. The cost—facing exile’s loneliness and admitting belief’s interruption—is legible though conveyed gently, not through overt confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: walk through the arcade → encounter with Mira → chalk code → mentor’s hidden message → tactical adjustment of margins → suspended mailing. Causality under the textural lens holds: Oona’s past teaching enables decoding the present danger and reconfiguring the envelope. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—the realization that the true risk lies in margins and the promise to be the right guide—but the before/after shift is more conceptual than felt, with limited on-page consequence beyond the promise and brief delay. Still, the piece cleanly resolves its central situation without dangling threads or structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a clear causal spine: noticing missing names → mapping conspirators’ routes → testing adjacent possibilities on the cloth → subtly desynchronizing the observatory’s mechanisms to derail the coup’s timing. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she cannot prevent the coup but has materially weakened its certainty, and her cloth becomes a future survival map. Causality is tight within the chosen scale; each magical rule (candle, orrery, cloth) is consistently applied. The cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts a future crisis she can only soften, not avert.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: mangrove approach → houseboat ritual → doorway into hospital moment → return to labyrinth, with each phase causally linked by the shard and the letter. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural mode: recurring motifs (tide, letters, moonlight, unspoken apology) accrete until the single decisive change—she stays instead of leaving to smoke. Closure is on-page and costly: an alternate version of events is inhabited, not “fixed,” and the cost of previous absence is acknowledged rather than erased. The return to the mangrove with the letter left behind provides a resonant reconfiguration: the quest’s premise is reweighted from revision to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: waiting → deciphering the cast → negotiation outside → quiet return, with each phase causally arising from the last. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the translator midwifes a specific agreement at the jetty and redefines their own practice as “graft,” with visible ethical and emotional cost. The stakes—who gets Sifa, and on what terms of consent—are clear and remain central; the boy’s encoded wishes concretely drive the outcome. No orientation debt or lens confusion; the accumulative/casual hybrid remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: preparation of the display, activation via the film, intensification when the fog encroaches, and a conceptual turn toward spending joy rather than preserving it. Causality is soft but legible (choices around the display → reanimation of memories → confrontation with the fog’s possessiveness → decision to let the show blur and to leave). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: she abandons the fantasy of “saving” the past in favor of contagious, transient joy. The frame of the daydream and tram ride back neatly seals the arc without feeling like a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very tight: each beat—coin, console, echo-guiding, nested selves, discovered diagrams—deepens the same act of listening. Causality is clear within the lyric frame: questions → echoes → recovered mural memory → realization about the city’s and narrator’s listening practices. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts ongoing, costly openness to change and leaves the coin, knowing others will listen here and “I will be inside their listening.” The before/after (seeking answer vs consenting to perpetual waking) is legible with conceptual cost, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: premise → greenhouse praxis → Notice → confrontation → reaffirmed resistance. Causality is intact (Notice leads to reply-patterns; collectors’ visit leads to garden demonstration) and the closure provides a Conceptual Repricing: ledgers redefined as roots and petals. The cost of living under thought-taxation is more conceptual than concretely dramatized, so the final “win” feels slightly low-friction. Still, the throughline of resisting mental commodification is clear and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric skin: postcard → journey → negotiation → treaty → reconfigured shell. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early (“gargantuan shell we call home”), and the map/postcard are paid off through their roles in the treaty and final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: ache becomes music/food, the shell “adjusts its posture,” and the poet’s insomnia persists but loosens, registering cost. The only slight limitation is that resistance in the negotiation phase resolves somewhat smoothly, muting the sense of risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: routine caretaking → anomalous “hunger” sound → investigation of the cracked chime → passage through the museum → discovery of Aristea and the returning marvels → reorganization of the library and renewed stance. Causality is soft but legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the chime’s crack as the key hinge that reconfigures options. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses to keep working with the cracked chime, accepting both its impurity and its power to catch fragile names. Stakes stay largely conceptual (loss/preservation of names and marvels), which keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and causal: return → confrontation over the ink well → choice to attempt the vow-ritual → incremental opening of the door → shared work inside and renewed partnership. The drive lens feels Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural element: each promise and ritual act deepens the emotional and magical stakes until the door and relationship both open. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the move from “I” to “we” is explicit, and the cost of earlier silence is acknowledged rather than erased. The only thing keeping this short of the very top band is that the risk of refusal or failure at the door never quite feels live once the ritual is underway.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → presented with chain and living building → decoding the envelope → deriving the schedule → persuading the council → testing and partial resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the valley now has a practice and mindset (“as the building breathes”) that did not exist before. The stakes (habitat vs orchards) are declared and touched, but frictions are negotiated away quickly once the code is cracked—no turn truly threatens failure after the insight arrives. Still, for this length the single decisive deepening around the envelope decoding and lived trial is structurally solid and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from the steady ritual of weighing letters, through the Mara trauma, to Ezra’s arrival, the decision to send Thimble, the storm, and the bird’s return. Causality is intact under a textural lens: Ezra’s request + narrator’s history → the specific test with Thimble → waiting through the storm → reconfigured stance on trust at the ledger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the same systems (ledger, dust, attic, birds) are kept but now explicitly framed “across learning to trust again,” with a felt cost. The only minor limitation is that the external danger remains mostly implied; increasing concrete sense of risk during the storm could have intensified the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: workshop → logbook → light/grain convergence → cedar frame → crossing form a clear chain under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the father’s “necessary distances” and disappearance are reinterpreted, with the maze resolving into a meaningful initial and the fog-day choice reweighted. Cost is visible in the relinquishing of the abandonment narrative and in leaving the frame open “because doors worth crossing should never pretend to guard.” Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the drifting terrace conceit remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival → shared ritual → generator falter → renewed listening → sunrise revelation forms a clear arc under the “learn the rhythm of belonging” drive. The generator’s hesitation is a legible tightening that momentarily threatens the fragile connection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator recognizes the “simple secret” and chooses to remain, with the plaza mosaics retroactively charging the firefly-breath motif. The cost of this new path is more implied than dramatized, which slightly softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival at the cave → discovery of erasures → use of crater glass and seeds → realization about protective forgetting → negotiated compromise with bird and cave. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: absence is reweighted from threat to protective strategy, with the new “ribbon” rule marking a meaningful after-state. Cost is conceptual—the acceptance that some stories should stay hidden, and that navigation will always include loss—rather than dramatized pain, which slightly limits impact. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early despite the lyricism, so experimentalism never muddies stakes or ending.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation, encounter, shared game, parting, and the tide’s erasure form a coherent arc. Causality holds under a textural lens: his orchestrated setups invite her, their game unfolds as designed, and the environment (tide, next act setting up) gently closes the window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the bishop’s gift and the dissolving grid repricing “chance” as design, with the cost being his perpetual recommitment to beginnings as she returns to her straight-line life. The only limit is that the stakes of this “design of discovery” remain conceptual and quiet rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: secret practice → intrusion by the clerk → transformation of their relationship via the poem on skin. Causality is clear under a textural lens: each “gap” she exploits (his blinks, his silences) deepens the stakes and leads directly to the harbor that “no law can close.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the enforcer becomes co-exile, and their shared harbor and “chosen night” redraw the story’s moral map. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized in punishment, but the risk to them both is legible and present in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: pond ritual → choice to focus on the atrium → crafted light demonstration → harbor master’s partial change of stance → final pond confirmation. Causality is intact and legible under a textural drive; each move follows from the last and raises the stakes for the atrium’s fate. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s future options are reweighted when the harbor master decides to bring the council to see the atrium. The cost—preservation is not yet secured; they are poised at “the moment before everything shifts”—is subtle but present.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean present-tense ridge encounter interwoven with backstory of the fire and his earlier choice, all cohering under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is stable: past triage → ongoing guilt → ascent with box → conversation with Mira → decision to reframe his role and leave the box as compass. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after—hinge in one direction vs. hinge both ways—is legible and costly. The main limitation is a comparatively low sense of on-page jeopardy or time pressure; the piece relies almost entirely on introspective restructuring.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: establishing the grotto and gauge, iterating experiments (decorations, trial balloons, cross-timeline testing), then culminating in communal gatherings and a redefined “equation” of hope. Causality within the lyric mode holds—each new tactic (children’s songs, exchanges of broken tools and symbols) builds logically from prior realizations. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: hope is redefined from measurable height to relational exchange, with the ongoing weekly meetings and chalk proofs showing a persistent, earned shift. The only limit is that the cost of failure or potential loss is kept mostly conceptual and gently toned rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → discovery of grandmother’s diaries → activation of the film negative/humming method → hidden corridor → revelation of the drowned man → ethical recharting and exit, with a clear before/after. Causality is strong under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with each discovery logically enabling the next layer of access. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist’s relationship to legacy, the museum, and the echoes changes with visible conceptual cost. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain relatively contained to this one corridor rather than widening or complicating structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: terrace → painter arrives → ritual with mirrors → Lio’s personal vision → bells cut the moment → lingering change in how the city sees. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, and the ending offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the city now carries a “seam of brightness” and a habit of humming possibility. Cost is present but subtle—Lio is given only a “possibility, not a promise,” and the bells enforce real limits on magic. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable throughout, though the central emotional turn remains quiet rather than sharply delimited.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is a clean single scene with accumulative pressure toward a charged ritual closure; orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early. Causality is coherent: the ritual creates shared ground, the General’s confrontation about the ambush tightens stakes, and the negotiator’s vow shifts the options for all future conflicts. Closure is an on-page Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the accord exists, but at the cost of the narrator’s future voice and the precariousness of peace. A hairline limitation is that the “alignment” deadline feels more atmospheric than functionally constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is a tight single-scene progression from approach to chamber, to hatching, to decision about water policy, with because/therefore links throughout. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she refuses the drastic act, commits to a constrained mercy, with contracts and leverage still in force as cost. Orientation is clear early (salt flat, convoy, chamber beneath), and the reflective lines are always anchored in concrete action. The ending reweights the entire premise when thunder “carrie[s] the earlier song within,” functioning as conceptual repricing with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, the structure is clean: courtyard → failed door opening → recognition of a story-lock → unbraiding personal whispers → confronting the city’s great braid → sanctuary transformation → guild’s too-late arrival. Causality is tight (the lock “grew from story,” so unmaking stories unlocks it), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing: the city’s rest changes from imposed docility to self-owned grief. The cost is mostly conceptual and spiritual—Lira relinquishes hoarded whispers and takes on the risk of altering the city’s foundation—but it is legible. A touch more friction at the peak (any real near-failure at the braid or in the sanctuary) would bring this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: heated argument → solitary reckoning → outreach and negotiation → first bar test → quiet return to the dome. Causality is coherent and accumulative: the accusation of manipulation leads Aurel to reframe his method, delay the launch, and redesign the rules, which in turn shape the bar performance and its small but concrete successes (the drunk waiting, the puppet refusing a joke). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aurel’s project is now consensual and audience-led, the troupe’s relationship reset under new constraints. The cost—relinquishing control and admitting harm—is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive → build → attune to interrupted cadence → encounter the last monarch → assist and release → dismantle and vow. Causality is steady under a textural lens (each ritual act sets up the next, culminating in the monarch reading and riding the signal). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: signals vs monuments is repriced with the cost of extinction and the choice to keep building anyway. The one constraint is that tension never sharpens into a binary decision; the arc is more contemplative than pressured, which keeps this just short of fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: entry to sanctum → decoding rope via card → reconfiguring braids → awakening the organ → casting bronze tongues → choosing to stay. Causality is clean and motivated (“My teacher had said the door opens only when you illuminate the ropes with intention…” → lamp → mapping → braid reconfiguration), and each step follows organically from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the sanctum’s demand shifts from penance to work, and she accepts ongoing stewardship with emotional cost. The only thing keeping this just shy of top-tier is that no single decisive external complication threatens failure; the arc relies entirely on internalized ritual pressure rather than a sharper on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the bunker, encounter with the directive, reinterpretation, then outward action with the group and path choice. Causality holds under a lyric lens—the dreams lead to the bunker, the directive redefines the rules, and that prompts the final communal decision. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus decisive change: the directive becomes invitation, the path is co-authored, and the name loosens. Stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, so the felt cost is more implied than viscerally dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: tile → alignment → arrow → hidden niche → ash mirror → vow and departure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is sealed, and his identity is reweighted as “a man diminished into a method” who chooses attention as devotion. Stakes and drive stay coherent from entry (“to seal a covenant with the unknown”) through the final image, with the palace’s response constituting the decisive change. The only slight constraint is that the external risk remains muted—no explicit threat if he fails—so cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one contained encounter where the pacifist must persuade Mara, moving from demonstration on self to experiment on Mara to the external consequence of war turning home. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—the box, the sanctuary, and Mara’s grief all feed the final turn. Closure is decisive but quiet: resentment softens, and a war’s direction changes with clear emotional and political stakes. If anything, the siege’s logistical withdrawal is resolved a bit swiftly, but the internal decision driving it is well grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nights of ritual build to the third-night arrival of the dream, followed by a focused negotiation and reconfiguration of the orchard’s reality. Orientation (who, where, when, what he wants) lands within the opening lines and remains stable despite the lyric density. Closure is a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream accepts terms, the orchard’s state and the sextant’s function are transformed, and communal harvest becomes possible. The cost is more conceptual/emotional (enduring grief, relinquishing control in favor of belonging) than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single scene with an accumulative drive: arrive → diagnose the breach (pipe, kids, city) → attempt repair → sacrifice the ribbon → reframe vows and contracts. Causality within this lyric mode is solid: each physical move (chalk, wire, washers, ribbon) prompts new reflection and alters the water’s behavior, leading to a conceptual repricing of “breach” and “vows.” Closure is strong and on-page: the leak is re-taught, the cathedral “remembers fruit instead,” and the seasonal handshake/map moment crystallizes the new configuration of duty and promise with felt cost in the ribbon’s darkening. Stakes and timeline are modest but coherent; there are no orientation or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: arrival → rules and book → bathroom reflection → attempted non-choice → question to the orchard → conceptual revelation → new use of cameo → meeting the heir → seed epilogue. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the catalog shifts from trap to “window,” with the cameo and seeds embodying a new, less extractive logic. Causality is coherent in a lyric mode—each move grows visibly from the last—and the bathroom motif cleanly brackets the two main decision points. Stakes remain primarily conceptual/ethical, so the felt cost at the end is more intellectual than visceral, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clear and cohesive: traveler arrives → summons → negotiation with the living index → descent → footnote trap → apology solution → final renegotiation. The piece follows a single throughline with no orientation debt; the mountain-bookstore rules are learned by doing, and the “researching gaps” method bridges setup and resolution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator trades away the right to forget, exits with a new cost and capacity, and the traveler leaves having learned to apologize. Stakes remain intimate, but the costs are legible and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear accumulative path: board ship → funhouse/mirrors → automaton’s demand → horticultural deck → shared retelling as price, with each step causally or conditionally linked. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by paying the cost of jointly “recaptur[ing] the night,” they gain the names and a new internal map, then leave. The ship’s rule-set (“gardens do not open to halves,” “the ship is honest about bargains”) gives the piece a coherent underlying logic despite the lyricism. A minor softness is that the consequence of failure remains more implied than dramatized, keeping the stakes slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: archival anomalies → impossible door → mechanism room → pattern recognition → rope reconfiguration → temporal “repair” and archival reframing. The accumulative, lyric structure is consistent with a single continuous scene anchored in one POV, and the closure—a restored week, a retired door, and a reframed finding aid—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong from early on (campus, clock tower, archivist at work), and the fantasy mechanics stay internally coherent. What holds this just below the 9-band is that the stakes and constraints, while conceptually intriguing, never feel sharply narrowing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: descent → reading the ice → discovery of the unnamed chamber → ritual at the ice drum → reconfigured relationship with the caves and beings. Causality operates under a textural lens—each action with the stone and hush deepens options until “a door unstuck inside the air” opens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the caves now “map” them, the hush can guide others, and they step onto “readiness,” marking a before/after in how travel and risk will work. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the idea of risking erasure and jaw-clenched caves gives enough pressure to keep the stakes from feeling weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: set-up of world and beacon, the shard’s arrival as inciting condition, the repair attempt, failure when the wheel snags, retrocognitive recalibration, successful rekindling, then contact and response. Causality under a Hybrid (lyric/causal) lens is strong—each beat follows from prior conditions and Kera’s responses, and the closure (rekindled light and answered flare) carries clear before/after stakes. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (risking renewed connection and responsibility), but it is on-page. A slightly sharper sense of jeopardy if she fails would lift structural impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric progression: arrival after the fog solidifies → reading and testing memory-reefs → framing a conjecture → risking her core fear/joy → receiving a concrete answer. Causality is internally consistent under the world’s rules (storms harden memory; conjectures are tested against reefed fog; the forecourt records and returns what can be held). Closure is a conceptual reconfiguration: identity is redefined as the pattern remaining after practiced giving, with the cost legible in her relinquishing “earliest fear” and the burden she’s carried alone. Stakes remain focused and the final opening of a window onto an unwalked street is a precise before/after beat that pays off the entire setup.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → preparation guided by the mosaic → performance → aftermath, with each phase deepening the central task of arguing against despair. Causality is intact and legible—the mosaic’s instructions, wind, and crowd readiness all shape when and how Lio acts. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: no stars return, but the town’s courage and new “metronome” of humming reprice what rebirth means. The only mild limit is that the global drive remains more atmospheric than sharply problem-solution, which tempers the sense of a decisive structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative lyric structure is coherent: one continuous scene, clearly anchored, with pressure circling the same question until the narrator’s reframed answer lands. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—the decision not to decide yet, but to share the crossing—with the tide’s turn and the cicada’s sleep embodying that shift. Causality is soft but intact: the indirect cataloging of thresholds leads to a change in how the question is held, which alters the emotional situation. Stakes skew internal and symbolic, but the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: each pour of silence is a distinct beat that deepens stakes from sky-hush to rescue-quiet to bunker note, culminating in the alloying realization. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: past bunker experience motivates both the ritual constraints and the climactic decision to open the doll fully and blend silences. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing—reframing the father’s fear and bunker hush—which reconfigures the narrator’s relation to both silence and space, with cost in revisiting trauma. Orientation (gravity hour, trellis above clouds, bunkers below) is established early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: initial hush → bell shattering that hush → crafted reconfiguration of sound within silence → charged, quiet exit at the next station. Causality is soft but legible: the grief-bell disturbance triggers tactical responses (wind, light, story, counting, route) that lead to a new equilibrium in which silence has been repurposed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “not arriving so much as completing a thought,” with a before/after visible in the bell’s transformation and the mother’s release. A touch more concrete sense of elapsed time or a clearer “point of no return” would be needed to push this into the true 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a slightly lyric surface: leave Archives → pass waterfall → decode trunks → descend to root-room → ascend to stairway → contact throne. Orientation is excellent and fast; we know who, where, when, and why by the fourth sentence, and the orchard mechanics (flake warming, murals, coordinates) are internally consistent. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing when Maris chooses stewardship and the throne reveals itself as a “radio made of rain,” reweighting rule-by-throne as listening rather than commanding. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page resistance—no beat truly threatens failure—so the emergency frame doesn’t fully crystallize into hard tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival at the ruin, ritual knocking, guided breathing, and the visitor’s departure. Causality is intact and legible, with each step naturally growing from the previous image or choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the loaded emptiness now “carried a pulse I did not have to supply alone,” reweighting the entire sanctuary premise with visible emotional cost. The before/after of the visitor’s breathing and the Keeper’s shared burden registers clearly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clear accumulative arc: eerie farm → introduction of parallel-text mechanic → offer of the chamber test → pressured ritual → emergence with the diamond-bead and new vow. Causality is solid under the textural lens: the MC’s decision to volunteer and heed the quantum texts leads to the promise, the sideways-pressure chamber, and the bead as embodied closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: a concrete artifact and ethical stance that mark a before/after. The cost is conceptual and social rather than bodily, but the risk and renunciation of pyramid logic are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous scene whose causal chain is solidly motivated (enter → wind → resonance → secret compartment → documents → revaluation of dynasty and self). The drive lens reads Hybrid but leans causal, with each revelation tightening the understanding of why the dynasty ended. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the protagonist’s role redefines from “dynasty ender” to guardian of encoded refusal, with a clear before/after. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than action-based but is clearly legible in the decision to “keep listening” rather than reclaim any power.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative/situational arc: discovery of the orchard → engagement with the program → following patterns → blueprint and doorway → mirror pears choice → return to altered greenhouse. Closure lands cleanly as a decisive reorientation of allegiance and role, with the cost of leaving his old identity rendered on-page via armor abandonment. Causality is lyrical but traceable (“He obeyed… With each measured stride…” → doorway opening), and there are no orientation or lens-clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the string → envelope → button/photo/note → ethical weighing → decision to mail, all under a single temporal arc. Orientation is excellent from the first line (post-emancipation, file room, archivist at work), and the backstory about Rowan and Alvarez is tightly anchored to present objects. Closure lands decisively when the archivist logs the act and mails the package, a Resonant Reconfiguration that redefines the room’s “unknown histories” at conceptual cost. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the external stakes remain modestly scaled, even for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mission to sustain a node → relay contact → rescue attempt → confrontation with revision squads → lagoon flare that produces public witness. The structure holds a single coherent drive with one clear tightening point at the squads’ appearance and a decisive, earned closure when the lagoon projects the erased. Closure cost is legible in the risk of capture and the irrevocable exposure of their network to public view. The hybrid causal/accumulative build of motifs (puddles, key, lagoon, “reappear”) is taught early and pays off at the end without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: arrival with purpose, engagement with the prophetic code, and incremental applications of “negative space” until the prophecy is muted. Causality holds within the magical logic (his specific tactics of silence cause the stutter and dissolution of the code into vowels and bubbles). Closure is a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the prophecy is only put to sleep, he accepts recurring, thankless duty, and the “empty frame” he carries home crystallizes that cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is legible early through the grotto and dawn frame, so the lyricism never undermines structural clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: establish role/folklore → Moonstone shifts the rules of reading → monument-building intensifies pressure → deciphered phrase forces a decisive, costly act (releasing all seed). Causality holds firmly within its lyric logic, and the warning about misreading the arbor’s language grounds the stakes for the villages, charging his final decision. Closure is strong: Fen’s action changes the arbor’s state, alters future folklore, and reconfigures his inner stance. No orientation or lens-clarity issues impair the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: fire → discovery of compass → noticing patterns → following it to the garden → finding the machine → connecting the rose → emerging to a reconfigured life. Structure is essentially two connected movements (descent and return) with one clear deepening at the machine, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of what “keeping time” means. Cost is visible in leaving the compass plugged into the machine and accepting a new, less certain vocation. The accumulative lyricism never obscures who/where/when, and the drive lens (hybrid of causal and textural, ending clearly textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from receiving the coin and mandate, through a stepwise forging process, to a redefined understanding of redemption. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “To redeem is not to undo; it is to choose a joining…” and the decision to face the father with this imperfect disc, accepting hatred as cost. Every beat of present action (annealing, hammering, inlaying, stamping) tracks to that closure, with no orientation issues. The before/after—the narrator’s stance on redemption and their responsibility to Mira’s name—is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure cleanly follows a single causal-through-textural arc: arrive at gorge → play harp → summon confessions → bargain with the laugh via confession → leave reconfigured. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the confession about refusing the drowning man and the widow’s laugh directly earns the new relationship to laughter carried “like a small river under my tongue.” The stakes and throughline (pursuing the specific laugh to transform its function) remain coherent and are resolved on the page. Orientation is clear from the opening and the lyric pattern is taught early and maintained without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: waking → entering maze → triggered memories → pool and equation → leaving the strap forms a clear progression. Causality is internal and situational rather than event-driven, but each sensory cue plausibly triggers a deeper layer of the central quest for “mathematics of mercy.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator redefines mercy conceptually and alters their relation to the torture apparatus (strap/maze). There are no orientation issues, and the before/after is legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: entering the market, meeting the elder, reading the lighthouse painting, then breaching the hidden door and journal all form a clean escalation toward deeper revelation. Causality is coherent—using the fragment to read hidden details leads directly to the recovered names and the market’s subtle shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the painting becomes a map, the market is “taught to read its secret threads,” and the narrator departs with a renewed, cost-aware commitment to listening. The “eternal instant” circularity enhances rather than blurs orientation, so the lyric mode holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/causal spine: arrival → fluorescent dies → ghosts request → dust analysis → first hatch → barrel → second hatch → unwinding the grift-mechanism → release of ghosts → departure. Orientation is very clean from the opening (“abandoned circus ticket office,” “elevator repair technician who sees ghosts”), and each discovery grows logically from prior actions rather than feeling arbitrary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the crooked time and hidden apparatus are physically lowered and left open, the ghosts depart, and the narrator’s stance (“carrying nothing but the habit of looking up”) marks a before/after. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, so the change, while clear, feels slightly low-stakes in worldly terms, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: daily ritual → strange bottle → unprecedented pattern → risky press adjustment → orchard rupture → cooled page and re-corked silence, with each step intensifying the same drive. Closure clearly qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the rules of the orchard and of “eternity” are reweighted when reality agrees to be held “for a heartbeat.” Causality within the lyric mode is clean—warnings about rupture and buoyancy pay off exactly when the grief-based spacing is used. The cost is legible in the orchard’s remapping and the felt compression of time against the narrator’s ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is clean: a single tribunal scene, linearly unfolding with embedded visions from the shard, under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is sound—Neris’s devised calibration leads to the shard’s tableaux, which reframe the dispute and enable the judge’s ruling—and the storm functions as a parallel pressure clock that tightens toward closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early despite the dense lyric surface, and the rules around visible time and storms are consistent enough for the ending to land. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s status shifts from quarry to “open conservatory,” with conceptual cost (a new civic obligation) and personal cost (Neris reaccepting the ache of stewardship and latent revolt).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is clean: dawn’s theft → rust covenant’s prohibition → construction of drum/tether → descent into midnight → liberation of light → renegotiated oath. The structure holds under a mostly causal lens with lyric flourishes; the closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration as morning is restored and the elders amend their oath. The main weakness is that opposition (especially the constable) yields somewhat easily, sanding down a sense of real peril or cost. Still, the piece maintains clear stakes and delivers a concrete before/after reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: compass → cave → seam → inner chamber → vial → return, with each step deepening the central drive rather than branching sideways. Causality is stable and legible even in the lyric register: the compass and psychometry repeatedly trigger new options. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the narrator vows to keep certain knowledge, takes a single paradoxical sample, and returns to a changed, quieter shore. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and spiritual rather than dramatically contested, but the arc from industrial noise to curated hush is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric drive: GPS failure → discovery of the arch → night of building and survival → decision to reframe her work in the village. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—she conceptually reprices her “delivery” as a communal, timewoven project—with a felt cost of abandoning her prior, more individualist trajectory. Causality is broadly coherent and the storm and slide serve as persistent constraints/guides. Escalation is gentle, though; the life-or-death dimension of the storm never fully tightens into a concrete on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure (cathedral → seasonal work → pavilion) is coherent and clean, with each stage deepening the central inquiry rather than branching into new threads. The postcards and glass method provide concrete causal links between beats, and the seasonal progression is legible without confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the question returns and is answered not by information but by a new stance on permission and offering, with a clear before/after in how the narrator will paint. The cost—relinquishing the comfort of explicit meaning and control—is conceptually strong and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain from letters → diary → retrocognitive trap → parley with Esteban → debris experiment → final ethical stance is clean and satisfying. The closure—a reconfigured understanding of what a truthful record must hold—lands clearly with cost. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal progression carrying an accumulative ethical weight) and holds consistently. If anything, the inciting “letters” feel under-specified relative to the diary, but the main spine remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, and the pattern is taught early then held: repeated engagements with the bottle, lanterns, and method spiral toward a closure where imagining becomes communal enactment. Causality is coherent (wish-flood → rejection of wishes → disciplined planning → projection → arrival of co-builders), and the closure image of shared, unspectacular labor is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost—foreclosing magical rescue and embracing slow, exacting work—is legible in the final beats. Structure is linear and contained, with no orientation debt or unresolved set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: a single nocturnal ascent leads to experiment, revelation, and a focused ethical decision, all causally linked. The accidental prophecy and the recognition that it is his earlier famine oath tighten the frame into a clear before/after: routine archival practice becomes a question of whether to intervene. Closure lands in the decision to inscribe the prophecy instead of sealing the split, a Conceptual Repricing of what “binding” means with on-page cost (he allows a vow to fracture). The accumulative lyricism never obscures where we are in the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/causal spine: arrive to reopen doors → prepare ritual → sing with hatchling → ark unlocks → narrator encounters “borrowed time” in the seeds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the narrator experiences the literal texture of borrowed time and actively passes the tool of power forward (crowning the hatchling), accepting cost in vow and spent memory. Stakes and rules around the Maxwell-demon atrium and entropy-singing are introduced early and paid off coherently. The only softness is that opposition is mostly environmental and spiritual, so structural pressure is more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: sensor repair → waiting → reading microclimate data → zero-hour dilemma → choice for silence → reflective denouement. Orientation (who, where, when) is clear very early, and the “zero hour” framing effectively tightens the scene toward the central decision. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: refusing the alarm test forecloses institutional expectations in favor of a different safety paradigm, with the cost (professional and political) legible even if not dramatized. The final image of the rope’s “clean, unstartled sway” reconfigures the whole preceding ritual with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: solitude → threatened decommission → demonstration of meteor-listening ritual → reprieve and new communal stance, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the place shifts from lonely custodianship to shared guardianship, and the “season” reprieve carries a felt cost and fragility. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable and paid off by the intensified meteor storm and collective listening. If anything, the external stakes resolve a bit smoothly—resistance from the crew is minimal—but the emotional and conceptual closure still feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, ritual-lyric structure is coherent: discovery of the box → decoding the covenant → re-enactment to retie it → departure carrying the burden. Causality within the chosen lens is clear—each understanding leads to a new, deeper action—culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure where Mara accepts the cost of bearing meaning without translation. Orientation (who/where/what) is anchored very early; the “after ghosts become visible” frame is legible and consistent. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through concrete loss, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: world premise → quest to the silo → capsule opening → revelation that past/future self engineered this → debt payment and reconfigured role. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure—a shift from hoarding borrowed time to stewarding communal repair—lands clearly. The cost of releasing the borrowed coins is conceptually present but emotionally underlined only briefly, so the ending feels more graceful than hard-won. Orientation is solid despite the lyric opening, and there are no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal: tranquil observation → family’s joy → kite failure → collaborative, philosophically charged repair → reflective closure. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator’s mission is reweighted by the feather’s “second life” and the boy’s altered understanding of brokenness. Stakes and situation remain coherent in time and space; the lagoon, wind, and reeds are stable anchors. Closure lands squarely with the reframed idea of damage (“Not every cut needs sutures…”) and the offered poem, with cost legible in what is relinquished and redefined.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: methodical tending → pattern recognition → storm-triggered opening → chamber discovery → articulated pact → ceremony of listening, with each step logically building from the last. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to a new, listening-centered model of caretaking under the constraint of limited time. Causality is clean within this lyric mode, but the cost of her choice (and what she risks by inviting humans in) is more implied than acutely pressured on the page, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure of the pilgrimage—boar, heron, tower—builds cleanly toward the tower-threshold closure with no orientation debt. Each step causally follows from the premise (follow alien dust via evidence to test homecoming chemistry), and the bell-rope experiment is a satisfying culmination rather than a bolt-on. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: homecoming redefined as exchange constant, with the envoy’s “we arrived together” crystallizing that shift. The only constraint on a higher score is that the structural turns feel gently continuous rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an accumulative/textural lens, building a ritual of postwar gardening until the veteran arrives and the private practice acquires direct human stakes. Causality is coherent: reef dies → treaty dissolves → narrator adopts a new “route” of concord through planting, culminating in the veteran planting where he bled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with the anticipated surfacing of “concord” reweighting all prior grammar/seed work. The cost—time, grief, and the difficulty of rebuilding peace without formal sanction—is legible, though never sharpened into a single, high-pressure pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: trader → phonograph → first message/riddle → tinted revelation via leaf → decoded directions → mechanical action at the spindle → discovery of water → communal shift and final repricing of listening/closeness. The drive lens reads as Hybrid but ends strongly in an accumulative/textural RR, with the water and shared listening reweighting the entire premise at closure. Closure cost is clear and on-page—the years of thirst, grief, and emotional risk of hoping again are all made tangible by the settlement’s transformation. The only thing holding this shy of 9+ is that the puzzles resolve with minimal friction; the protagonist rarely seems at risk of misinterpreting or failing them.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: arrive alone after shutdown → observe anomalies → use family method to re-interpret data → discover valley as “true north” → realign the instrument and send the pattern. Causality is coherent and accumulative under a largely textural drive: the anniversary sketch comparison meaningfully tightens into the valley discovery. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—time drift becomes path, ostracism becomes vocation—with a legible before/after. The stakes stay primarily conceptual and professional rather than concretely jeopardized, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clear: climb → enter spire → chess-secret trials → Kestrel’s confession opens the stair → deeper trades → the frozen clock and vow amendment → re-emergence under a reweighted sky. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: they do not fix the sky but amend themselves to it, with the cost in secrets surrendered and fears faced. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative lyric texture) and holds cleanly. Stakes and consequences are legible at the ending even as some world-rules remain purposefully mysterious.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure—learning the walking method, triggering stored murmurs, then consciously choosing to unbind the cord and write new words—builds a coherent arc from disorientation to assumed duty. Causality is soft but present: drills → real crisis → need for new grammar → encounter with Custodian → initiation ritual → acceptance of role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator commits to a new, costly function (carrying grief, teaching it to migrate) with the Custodian’s nod as a charged seal. A slightly clearer beat of external stakes beyond “city forgetting itself” could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural drive: ascent to the mountain bookstore → negotiation at the gate → approach to the stone → reading via feather → offering and reconfiguration of “home.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: home is reframed from address to practice, and this realization is anchored in concrete action (the breath-seed, the carried feather, the reshaped room). The cost is explicit—the years spent paying “the difference between shelter and hiding” without receipt, and the risk of bleeding endless stories if meaning “bites.” Causality within this lyric frame is coherent and continuous, with no orientation debt or late rule-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → recognition of the labyrinth → discovery of tapestry mechanics → experiments with threads affecting villagers → culminating self-inclusion to break the hush. Closure is decisive and on-page: the village resumes, the pawn is surrendered, and his stance toward his past and vocation reconfigures with clear cost. The hybrid drive (external puzzle + internal forgiveness) stays stable throughout and converges at the center-opening moment. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the before/after is legible at both world and soul levels.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece runs as a clean accumulative structure: backstory about the sister and the spire’s economy of forgiveness builds to the public confrontation via the poetry sessions. Causality is clear (sister’s death → narrator’s project → community refracting the story → challenge at the decree), and the pattern of echoes/versions is well taught before the climax. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing: forgiveness is redefined and the canyon “waited,” with a clear before/after in the moral economy. The main limitation is that we don’t yet see concrete consequences beyond fear and trembling, so the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine—statue pockmarks → gear ratios → discovery of fissure → sacrifice of charm to repair heartplate—is coherent and accumulates meaning toward a clear before/after: a failing engine vs. one that turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost when he melts the charm, altering both the machine’s state and his relationship to his mentor’s gift. The piece follows an accumulative/lyric structure but maintains clear orientation and a single dominant drive. A hairline limitation is that external consequences beyond the workshop’s drift into “mercy” are gestured at rather than stressed, keeping the scope a little contained for top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: cracked mirror → remembered promise → journey through caves → oasis painting → return, with each step a “therefore” rather than an “and then.” The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he no longer needs the mirror because he has enacted his own “temporary eternity” in the cave and on the canvas. The cost—accepting that the tide may reclaim the painting—is on the page and conceptually legible. Stakes remain intimate and low-external, but within that scope the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: waiting → choosing the whisper/scent method over the horn → Mara’s gradual return form a coherent arc. Causality holds under a lightly magical, textural lens: the ritual with the cork and beam is clearly positioned as the tactic that answers the earlier problem of distance and noise-scattering. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration rather than a twist—the world proves hospitable to his method, and relationships shift in response. Cost is present in the prolonged uncertainty and the real risk that his refusal to “bully” the sea could have left Mara unaided, even though the outcome is ultimately positive.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: hydraulics fail → improvised repair → real-time guidance of Rowan’s convoy → arrival and emotional coda. Causality is firm even in a lyric mode, with the broken dish and censer rig explicitly motivating tactics. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the narrator chooses to send one last bearing, prioritize Rowan’s grief over factual updates, and finally rest. The before/after—helpless dish vs. narrator as “missing motor,” and isolation vs. a station “filled with raw solace”—is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: foraging → acquisition of the eye → solo test → group trial → demand for return → renunciation. Causality is solid—especially the courier’s return forcing a decisive choice—and the closure (keeping the circle without the relic) lands with a clear before/after. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never wavers. The only limiter is that the external stakes remain modestly scaled and mostly internal/ethical, even if they’re well realized.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine—man dies → flower and gesture → investigation via gaps → encoded light → Mira’s acknowledgment → keeper’s ongoing signaling—is clean and legible despite the lyric texture. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his role shifts from mere lighthouse keeper to ongoing custodian of “borrowed memories,” with the cost of deepened, conscious isolation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a strong causal undercurrent, and the final choice is fully earned by prior beats. The only restraint is that the investigative deduction (from gaps in light/whistles to the specific name Mira) leans slightly on poetic logic rather than fully grounded procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and taut: chip in estate box → ants and ledger map → creek and storm pressure → cavern press → doorway seam → decision to repurpose his life and shop. The structure is a single continuous progression with one clear deepening at the cavern and a decisive closure beat back at the shop. Closure lands strongly as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid: he forecloses drifting in favor of communal responsibility, with a felt cost in relinquishing habitual solitude. No set-up is left unused, and there are no causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: warning → ascent to cobalt grotto → revelation of the wound’s origin → ritual naming and circlet removal → descent to ember grotto to complete the “lungs” and restore balance. Closure is solidly on the page: the world’s wound is partially healed and her status as queen is relinquished, with clear conceptual and emotional cost. The drive reads as a Hybrid of causal and accumulative/textural, and that lens holds through the end. A touch more on what renewed “breath that would not cost a body” concretely changes for her people would deepen the stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: preparation at the nexus, iterative calibration laps, the whispered secret as triggering event, and the reactor’s successful condensation of presence. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each action (adding vials, revising coefficients, walking the circle) thickens the field until the secret crystallizes it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s “coefficients” are rewritten, the city feels sturdier, and ordinary bustle now occurs in the new gravity. The cost—Lio’s exposed secret and the irrevocable change to how presence is valued—is legible, though not harrowingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: grave → cabin/scroll → lucid flight → tribunal of selves → return to ridge → quiet ledger dream, with each turn deepening the central drive to “keep the ledger.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance shifts from anxious, jealous chronicler to a custodian who accepts being both “tomb and mouth” with cost. Causality is lyric but coherent—dream experiences and interrogated envy directly alter the narrator’s stance and subsequent actions. One could argue for a slightly sharper hinge between the soaring dream and the council-of-selves sequence, but the pattern is taught early enough that this doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the shop opens, the midwife arrives with a specific problem, the complication (the screw) is revealed, and the solution must honor both function and history. Causality is tight under a textural lens; each observation of the clock or the midwife’s body language leads to a more charged understanding and then to the repair tactic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the screw is adjusted but kept, and “tiny applause shaped like water meeting time and finding mercy” recasts all prior beats. The felt cost—carrying a difficult birth forward without erasing its trace—is clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is tight: a single ritual window framed by the incoming storm, the held breath, the near-failure when the tea crystallizes, and the recovery via superstition and the hinge rune. Causality is clean under a textural lens—each step (tea property → hesitation → frost → superstition tactics → thematic realization) narrows options and deepens stakes. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance toward scars and stories changes on the page, with cost in physical strain and emotional risk. Orientation is impeccable from the opening line despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: arrival → plan → ritual → ghost contact → apology/recording → aftermath, all under the ticking clock of the impending tree-cutting. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator shifts from exploiter to witness, at emotional cost, and the orchard’s loss is counterweighted by the salvaged music. Cues for who/where/when are clear very early, so the density of metaphor never obscures orientation. The only slight limitation is that the ritual unfolds without any serious procedural snag, keeping the causal spine strong but not razor-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—three circles around the dais, each deepening the arbitration—reads coherent and purposeful under a textural drive lens. Causality is soft but legible: walking activates the chamber, the dictionary reframes illusion as play, that reframing enables the final stance and quiets the chorus. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: unity through mutual transparency rather than verdict, with a subtle before/after in how “illusion” and “witness” are understood. The cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing authoritative judgment), which is effective but could be more sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: initial calm, discovery of anomalous drift, methodical investigation, a subtle fix, and a reweighted understanding of time. Causality holds at a lyric level (because the drift is “eminently peculiar,” he checks systems, counts down, and finally adjusts the petcock with the mantle key). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “what clocks really measure” is reframed as the changes we can bear, with the system returning to a new pattern. Stakes and cost are more philosophical than concrete, which slightly limits impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clear causal throughline—alert → investigation with Ren → confrontation with Mira → conceptual redefinition of “intrusion”—within a single continuous night. Orientation is strong from the first sentence: role, place, and rough time are all quickly legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: reprogramming sensors to “listen for conversations instead of footsteps” and sending a consent pulse that redefines the system’s purpose. Costs are more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after in the narrator’s stance and the farm’s security doctrine is clean and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine (library cataloging → discovery of his handwriting → coded address → ward confrontation) is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with an elegant hinge into the ward, accumulating pressure rather than relying on big external turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her pattern-reading and his gambling ethos are reframed as a shared, fragile language in the final lantern-and-rain tableau. The cost—his illness, her constrained hope, and their uneasy peace—feels present even in the quietness of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is a clear accumulative mosaic: past vignettes of wrong-number pairings build a pattern that primes the culminating “pair of orphans of intention.” Causality is emotional rather than event-driven, but coherent: her learned practice of “cultivated estrangement” leads to the key action of looping the band-leaver and spouse-leaver together. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final call embodies her motive, and the last image (alone with disc and streetlamp hum) marks an ongoing costful stasis. The only reason this doesn’t hit 9+ is that the personal cost to her, while evident, remains more thematic than sharply turned in that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous ritual scene whose beats (arrival, preparation, recitation, inscription, signing, release) accumulate toward closure. Causality under an accumulative lens is strong: because the town’s covenant has frayed, she performs the ritual; because of her grief, she alters what she records and how she handles the locket. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she recommits to the covenant knowing she cannot restore the lost woman, only metabolize the ache into communal duty, with that cost on the page. Orientation (who/where/when, stakes) is clear early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: station → rumor about moon rock → journey to surveyor → invention of new rumor → emergence of a self-sustaining community. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure unit is clear when Mara writes “This is the moment when the story changes” and then relinquishes the rock to the ivy. That move reconfigures the situation from crisis-management to enduring community with an emotional cost (her continuing semi-invisibility). There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues; the pattern is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: entering the forest → following the dowsing ring and note-trail → reaching the stillpoint → encoding it and leaving changed. Causality is coherent and orientation is excellent; the ritual timeframe (“pause of shifting constellations”) brackets the journey effectively. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he now carries a reliable internal map and can guide others. The cost is more implied than dramatized—past pain and the risk that “the stillness could cut” never quite bite in real time—keeping this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a mainly causal lens with lyrical texture, the chain from mis-seeded array → altered past → shuttle mishap → narrator’s pen repair → subtle reconfiguration of events is coherent and satisfying. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator shifts from “fixing” to inviting the past to “sit differently,” with the array responding to suggestion rather than command. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never in doubt, despite the high concept. The only slight limitation is that the off-page near-accident somewhat dissipates immediate on-page danger, but the emotional and conceptual stakes stay tight.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is tight: harbor arrival → plan → gathering volunteers → synchronized counter-regatta → harbor’s “answer” → quiet denouement at home. Each phase follows organically, especially the soft confrontation with the police boat that could have broken the event but instead deepens it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the camera’s “empty photograph” and the line “absence teaches presence” clearly reweight all prior motifs with emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/what) is clean from the first sentence and the drive lens (textural accumulation) holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine—arson → clues in art → archive → portraits/breath reels → vault → new Ember Lending space—is clean, legible, and accumulates pressure without plot amnesia. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator shifts from burning to preserving, with the matches-in-water image marking a before/after that carries clear cost in self-redefinition. The archive’s mechanics (tapestry as key, breath reels as map) are imaginative but remain internally consistent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The only slight limitation is how swiftly external opposition (the board, institutional danger) drops out of the climax, keeping the confrontation largely internal rather than structurally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → drumming to summon Jonah → system’s consent warning → shared walk → parting and resolve to return. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens: each intensification (the garden’s response, Jonah’s emergence, the warning, the deeper merge) follows from prior actions. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—the choice to accept identity blur for the chance to continue their shared dream, with cost legible in “If the cost was that my outline blurred… I would accept.” No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the experimental setting is taught early and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric texture: storm → wager → whisper-vent navigation → successful retrieval → reflective coda. Orientation is firm from line one (who/where/when) and never wobbles despite the lyricism. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the test succeeds, the principle about whispers is proven in action, and the last line marks a before/after in how the steel—and the narrator—hold memory. The main limitation is that the time constraint (“before dawn”) and physical danger stay more conceptual than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rain’s end → boy’s arrival → descent to boats → ritual with shutters and light → brother’s emergence → quiet dispersal, all under one continuous temporal flow. Causality is legible and satisfying, even within the quasi-mystical register (the shutters and mirror repeatedly framed as tools, not deus ex machina). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city is “lighter by one lesson,” the vow endures, and the canal’s listening has been subtly altered with a felt, if quiet, cost. The main limitation is the relatively low resistance at the climax—the rescue unfolds smoothly once the ritual begins, so the decisive turn feels more inevitable than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative structure: from grotto conception to organizing to the window-lit culmination to the council member’s hesitating second thoughts. Causality is clean—organizing the displays leads to the charged night, which leads to political hesitation and procedural delay. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the town has not been “saved,” but the council member’s pause and the narrator’s final vow make a before/after legible with conceptual cost. The only minor limit is that the practical risk and potential losses remain more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: whale-call → crossing → encounter with the island → return and communal transformation, all causally legible. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the narrator abandons performance and reframes the dock work as “hauling mercy and lowering pride.” The whale’s call and the scrimshaw’s function recur as motivated structural hinges, not ornaments. Cost is visible in the relinquishment of ownership and identity, and in the commitment to ongoing, non-heroic work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: life under the turbines → neighbors’ wary relationship → inspector’s visit → reconfigured stasis with birds and hush. Causality is soft but coherent (his past mandates the inspection; his choices shape the tone and outcome of that visit), and the ending offers a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise rather than a vague fade-out. The dominant stake—how he lives ethically and emotionally after the mandate—is carried through to closure. The piece stays in one situation rather than escalating to a sharper turn, but for this mode it’s sufficient and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is very clean: atrium expectancy → paraphrasing the ban → path forming → crossing the ice → communal uptake, leading to a clear before/after in how boundaries function. Causality is legible within the lyric frame—his paraphrasing loosens the quartz, which generates the path, which allows the literal crossing and social reconfiguration. Closure lands as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: law becomes vibration and listening, not prohibition, with the wall inscription crystallizing this shift. Cost is present as the relinquished “old idea of separations” and the risked sacredness, though it is felt more as systemic/spiritual price than as acute jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is very controlled: arrivals (traveler, mother), the failed phoenix, and the plant treaties build toward the key turn where the reed in the cracked phoenix produces song. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city’s belief in safety after the phoenix rises is reweighted into “practice becomes festival,” with the repaired-not-repaired phoenix as proof. Causality is clean under a textural lens—each new awakening extends the central premise rather than side-stepping it—and there are no orientation or rule breaks. The cost at closure is subtle but legible: the community relinquishes the comfort of perfection/safety myths for an ongoing, imperfect practice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, station-to-station structure is clean and coherent, with each beat deepening the idea of a “pilgrimage” of sound and connection. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of the lamp’s ember and the neighbors “trusting the slow bell of each other” reweights the entire experiment with a felt, communal cost tied to the blackout. Causality is soft but consistent—this is textural rather than plot-driven—yet the throughline (design → opening → experience → reflection) is legible and satisfying. The cost is conceptual and social rather than dramatic, but it is undeniably on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is controlled: recruitment via cranes → gathering of mourners → ritual with curtains and lockets → seeds’ response → decision to continue the practice forms a coherent arc. Causality is clear under a textural lens: each step arises from the narrator’s prior failures and intentions, and the ritual’s outcome reconfigures what their craft means. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the observatory becomes a permanent practice space, with visible cost in the narrator’s commitment to keep inviting and tending the grieving. There are no orientation issues, and the pattern taught in the first third (observatory + curtains + grief-work) holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very clean: from initial consultation to mapping, to the discovered “gap,” to the experiment of multiplying paths, to the communal gathering and humming loft. Each phase grows logically from the previous one, and the closure—private panic reconfigured into public rhythm—lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing with social cost (abandoning chart-faith for fragile communal routes). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph and never slips, despite the lyricism. The drive lens (accumulative mapping of routes into meaning) is taught early and held rigorously through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is very clean: arrival → method → first atom revelation → second atom temptation → release → pagoda’s response and realization. Causality is consistent (guardians via patterns, purification choices, archive reacting) and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: she shifts from private mastery to dangerous sharing. The cost—betraying her teachers and exposing the method to “anyone to read”—is legible on the page. It doesn’t quite reach absolute tightness of a 9+ because escalation is more smoothly lyrical than sharply segmented, but it still feels fully coherent and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the missed dawn → luminous-regret chime → discovery of the eaten dream → investigation via reels → ritual binding provide a clear before/after in how grief is held. Causality is lyrical but coherent—each step logically follows the vocation and world rules, and there are no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: one grief is transformed from drifting shadow into rooted book/stone, and the narrator’s ongoing task is reweighted by that success and its cost. The cost is legible in the narrator’s warmed palms and “luminous regret that still chooses dawn,” showing a life shaped and burdened by this work.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight: discovery and collapse of the con → donors’ reaction → nighttime reckoning → offer of conditional redemption, all cleanly motivated. The causal chain from the inspector’s visit to their shared administrative repair and then to the tactile rebuilding of the habitat yields a clear before/after in terms of ethical stance. Closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: the chameleon’s living tail re-prices the earlier fake talismans with a felt cost. The piece leans lyric-accumulative but never loses situational clarity, so drive remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: surgery → displaced miracle → plant telepathy → discovery that the miracle has migrated into the tower → descent to confront ivy/elm → consentful wounding to reclaim it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator changes their method of seeking closure and accepts scars as readable, not erasable, with a visible cost (cutting the elm, keeping their own scar open as “a book”). The accumulative lyric structure is tight; each beat (fern, coffee rings, tunnel, ivy, elm) builds understanding and narrows options without digression. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost despite the dense imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the booth → selection of film strip → psychometric journey through scenes → discovery of where unused love resides → ritual of cutting and archiving → charged final projection. Causality is coherent under a lyric, slightly magical framework, and the throughline of “relieving” the building’s weight gives the piece a spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rules of what film/leader mean are reweighted with conceptual cost (unused love remains, relocated rather than resolved). Stakes are largely internal/conceptual, but the sense of before/after in how the manager will treat the materials is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival at the arch, entry into the deeper realm, freeing the fledglings, and return to town form a coherent causal arc. The transition through the doorway (“The scratches aligned into a doorway of measures…”) is clear and well-motivated. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—the town’s awakening and the narrator’s costly new obligation “across an unwritten calendar.” The one limitation is that the central task unfolds smoothly, without on-page complications that might more tightly test tactics or deepen the causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: train → dune → ritual → archive’s test → seeding sparks → return to the train, all under a stable lyric, quasi-causal lens. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he has successfully opened the divergent archive, scattered “rescued maybes,” and returns bearing its whisper, but remains bound to his role and the frozen clock. Cause and effect are clear in the story’s own terms (song/wave functions → door → archive demands proof → he sacrifices sleep → archive yields sparks). The cost—permanent dreamlessness and the ongoing burden of the clock—lands on the page and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure (wandering/listening → following tonal currents → tower test → mirror realization) is coherent and pays off in a clear Conceptual Repricing: the frontier was self-fenced all along. Causality in a lyric mode is solid—each escalation (small gear, tonal map, tower, mirror) arises as a “therefore” from the previous pattern, not an arbitrary addition. Closure lands decisively with cost: abandoning prior self-gating and accepting a redefined identity as “the frontier” itself. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable throughout, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drive is accumulative/textural with clean causal threads: leash break → ferry crossing → ridge vigil → indirect search → reunion and altered return. Structure is linear and legible despite the lyric register; each ritual (ticket stamps, switchbacks, lullaby) marks progression toward closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the human–dog relationship and the notion of courage are reweighted into “walking after the leash breaks” with no pulling. Cost is evident in the slow, indirect path and the sustained willingness to resist panic and chasing, not merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival → guided orientation to the fortress’s rules → revelation of the engine → bolt choice → return through the space with a reweighted stance. Causality is tight under an accumulative/causal lens: because she carries the piano bolt and seeks to weigh safety honestly, she is brought to the machine and must decide how to use it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she refuses full complicity by half-loosening the bolt and choosing to remain as a potential breaker of the hush, with visible ethical cost. No orientation debt or lens confusion; the piece sustains one coherent drive.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean for a lyric-mosaic: early setup of the pretender’s revisions and Lys’s marginal counterwork accumulates toward the confrontation at the ledger. The causal spine—messages → gathered faithful → rune-guided corridor → ledger → erasure of title—is clear and satisfying. Closure is solid: the pretender’s authority is revoked, the true line reasserted, and the signet reduced to “Seasoning for future recipes of caution and remembrance.” Stakes remain mostly conceptual (history and legitimacy) rather than felt as direct peril, which slightly blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: methodical observation and tapping habits accrete until the nodal cycle insight reconfigures the situation. Causality is coherent—logs, atlas note, and Jun’s “node” prompt all converge to explain the Trace’s periodic disappearance, leading to concrete communal actions (beacons, bell, teaching children). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: paths and memory are re-understood as subject to larger lunar patterns, with a quiet but legible cost in the acceptance of “late” lessons. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings) is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: arrival → preparation → wiring the stones to the ferry → cautious power-up → broadcast and communal response → engine revival, all in one continuous, legible scene. Causality holds under a hybrid/accumulative lens—each step naturally follows the last, and the closure (ship wakes, city reconnected, lull redefined) is earned. The cost is implied rather than dramatized (risk of exposure, emotional risk of hope), which slightly softens the impact. Still, the before/after is clear: a dead ship and isolated people become a quiet, living network anchored in this act.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is clean and strong: finding and decoding the kite script → performing the unsealing ritual → hearing the embryo’s question → revising the sigil → hatching a being whose “destiny” is now configured around consent. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and the closure unit is a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: tradition’s rule-set is literally rewritten on the page. Cost is legible in her open defiance of the council and the embrace of an unknown, potentially dangerous future rather than the safe, museum-like fate they want. Structure is tight and linear despite lyricism; there are no dropped setups or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly linear from morning preparations through the ceremony to a quiet aftermath, with clear causal links (storm pressure + trauma responses → relocation of the event → ceremonial choices → final placement of the photo). The dominant drive is accumulative/textural, but cause-and-effect remains sturdy enough that the closure (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise around the pearl and photograph) feels motivated and inevitable. The escalation from email insistence to worsening weather to live objections is smooth, though not architected for maximal dramatic crunch. Closure lands with a tangible before/after in how she holds her dead, at an appropriate scale for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: arrival at the lighthouse, discovery of records and tools, descent into the mechanism, and the untangling that restores the beam and reframes her vocation. Causality is legible even in lyric mode—the choice to confront the tangle leads directly to both the literal beam and the internal opening (“the room seemed to open inside her instead”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after in how she understands portraiture. Escalation is more meditative than peril-driven, so the sense of cost is emotional rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: arrive at encampment → deploy drone and ink → open gate → re-enter crisis → test/confirm theory → return with cost and a changed plan. The structure is linear and legible despite the conceptual material, with the ink corridor as a clean hinge between present experiment and fossilized past. Closure is strong: the protagonist reconfigures both understanding of time and future practice, paying the emotional price of re-witnessing the sister’s death and the physical risk of the beam. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the hybrid causal/conceptual drive holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: thaw capsule → read letter → moral calculus → reanimate dormant network → dispatch and immediate citywide reception → quiet confrontation with the shadow. Structure is essentially one continuous accumulating scene, with closure landing as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she has irrevocably broken protocol, and the city’s internal discourse has shifted. Cost is present (fear of punishment, destabilized order) but more conceptual than concrete, which keeps it just shy of top-tier impact. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and the accumulative drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine beneath its lyric surface: tower falls → refugees arrive → father returns with a demand → storm threatens the dome → joint repair → renunciation of the knife. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative motifs), and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration when the father hangs up the sheath and stays. Stakes and costs are explicit: if they fail, the dome and people die; if she yields, she surrenders her ethos; if he stays, he abandons his old calling. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the father’s claim “the tower did not fall; it was felled, and his work remains” is gestured toward rather than structurally tested within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal line is clean: he enters the garden with a goal, uses the spike and his silence-craft to hunt pockets where echoes pool, encounters the goddess’s echo as a direct consequence of cosmic and tactical setup, resists its tests, and jars it. The accumulative/textural structure is coherent, with each pass through the garden deepening rather than resetting the situation. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: he’s captured something dangerous and untamable to return to a child’s lullaby, while knowing it will retain its “teeth.” There are no orientation issues; the surreal world’s rules are consistently taught through action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s call → confrontation with Kline → discovery of log tampering attempts → intervention and confession → call back to journalist. Stakes and options narrow in a legible way, with the “article publishes tonight unless I intervene” clock keeping pressure on. Closure lands via a decisive ethical turn plus a resonant final image (the observatory “echoes thank you,” the city’s coffee tasting of “pen and contrition”), with reputational and relational cost clearly implied. Structure is linear and coherent, with no orientation debt or broken causality.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the letter-driven ritual provides clear structure and tightening: each letter escalates the task from setting up the machine to facing the specific cry and name. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—each step (amber lens, constellations, tethering, translating) grows from what precedes it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the initials joining at the end and the sensed lightness reprice the entire sequence of guilt and craft with visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that the external situation never truly threatens to go another way, so options feel narrow but not actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative ritual structure: arrival → hush ripening → mandala making → water pouring → reconfiguration and release. Causality is associative but coherent under the textural lens: each step grows from the prior (tile → listening → drawing → others adding ruins → water transforming patterns). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “we were not cured, but our noise learned to lean,” plus the returned tile and granted banister give a tangible before/after. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, but the structural arc is tight and satisfying for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense waiting for the patrol is interwoven with retrocognitive glimpses until the confrontation, where those glimpses become a tactic. Causality under the chosen lens holds: the tessera and plaza memories enable the narrator to defuse the patrol by invoking the leader’s past and renaming the threat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the plaza’s role, the leader’s stance, and the narrator’s self-conception all shift, with a felt cost in the ongoing burden (“The world will ask for more than this”). The only reason this doesn’t reach higher is that the external danger resolves a bit smoothly; the risk of failure could be more sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: ghost wakes → enters orchard → flips coin/creates echo → Rowan follows → blueprint recovered → future-oriented plan set. Causality is legible and each beat follows from the previous through the orchard’s logic, with the coin and echoes functioning as concrete mechanisms rather than hand-waving magic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Rowan’s “Please keep the path tomorrow” and the orchard’s answer reweight the opening despair with a new, earned trajectory. The main limitation is that costs and risks remain implied and gentle rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of irreversible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is tight: static shock → experimentation with the shard and somatic rig → discovery of the hidden path → finding and attaching the grounding strap → email reply and chosen stance. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: they accept a softened, permanent “neighborhood hum” and commit to non-pharmaceutical craft with visible responsibility. Causality is coherent; each new experiment arises from the prior condition and desire to “test the edges.” The only mild softness is that the external recall threat stays off-stage, but it still meaningfully shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: hike → immersion in the cave → discovery of the twin fossil → extraction and broadcast, with each step causally and texturally deepening the premise. The closure—feeding the cave’s chord, laced with the fossil’s signal, into the sleepers’ dream loops—functions as a resonant reconfiguration, recasting mapping as active intercession. Cost is conceptual but tangible: she knowingly sends only “half of the truth,” accepting responsibility for shaping how humanity reenters the world. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/why), and the lyric mode is coherent with no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build from solitary caretaking to communal action, with clear causal beats: button-mapping → echo release → prophecy’s hidden clause → joint hourglass ritual → rain road and salvage → re-corked echo and reframed prophecy. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing of fate vs. agency, and it is fully on-page. However, the resolution feels low-friction: once the protagonist decodes the prophecy, the town complies quickly and the cliffs cooperate almost immediately, so cost and constraint at the climax are modest. Even so, orientation is excellent and the throughline under the hybrid/accumulative lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causality is clean: message → bluff → codes → contact → hut → radio, with the pillbox and burn notice tying the chain together. Closure lands in her decision to use the burn and fix the radio, a Decisive Change that reconfigures her role from discarded asset to necessary outlier. However, the external stakes (“watchers,” “small nation of promises”) remain abstract; no concrete pressure tests her choice once she commits. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and it holds, but the cost at the end is more implied than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative under a situational/causal hybrid: arrival at the swollen ford → enforced waiting → reconsideration of the palimpsest → distilled vow → literal crossing. Closure lands decisively when the narrator commits to the single line and then physically crosses, with the ferry sequence and sun through fog making the before/after legible. The cost — risk of the bride’s refusal and the loss of the elaborate history — is on the page (“if the bride refused a smaller truth”). No orientation debt or lens confusion; every beat grows coherently out of the prior one.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is accumulative and clean: arrival → discovery of the lantern → revelation of braided timelines → experiments with kindness → conceptual answer and ritualized exit. Causality under a textural lens is solid: each new observation reweights the prior ones, and the phototropic-to-kindness rule emerges organically from on-page tests. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the potter learns what binds the oasis against ruin and accepts the cost of participating through unseen, future-focused repair. No orientation or lens-clarity debts; the only restraint is that external stakes remain quiet, though they are scaled appropriately for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece runs on a hybrid but predominantly accumulative/textural lens: each beat (petal falling, lock opening, mesh hung, neighbors reacting) deepens the same core drive rather than introducing new plot lines. Causality is clean and legible—she waits, unlocks, rigs the mirrors, the light alters the stairwell’s use—without any broken links or convenient shortcuts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the internal hush is reweighted as “a harbor,” and the project has visibly changed the building’s emotional landscape. The cost is conceptual and emotional (risking hope, transforming inherited tools and memories), but it is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: initial navigation of the tidal library → tuning the stone circle → entering the extinct wing → confronting the ledgered winter → making and witnessing the vow → returning to the aisles with a reconfigured stance. Causality is clear within this lyric mode, and the closure (choosing coexistence without craving reunion, leaving the sundial as beacon) lands with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, what is at stake) and the reincarnation/backstory shard is well-tethered via the ledger and hum. A tiny limitation is that the “after the reincarnation memory” frame is more atmospheric than structurally pressured, so time-pressure never fully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: temple arrival → discovery of nest/ribbon → decision to build the spiral → communal participation → the lover’s arrival and charged final tableau. Each beat causally grows from the last (wet letters need drying; nest inspires spiral; spiral attracts crowd; crowd creates the corridor for reunion). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role as secret-keeper is repriced into a public, shared cosmos of letters with a visible emotional cost (ongoing tending, exposure of private longing to the city). The before/after in stance—private ghostwriter vs. keeper of a public spiral—is legible and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc from strange midnight signals to social fracture to a deliberate counter-broadcast and its consequences, with each step logically seeded (charts → timing node → subsonic scaffold). Closure is strong: the tricksters are repelled, the community’s division loosens, and the narrator crystallizes an ethic, all on the page. The graveyard-shift window, node timing, and power-play tensions between students, faculty, administration, and donors provide a coherent structural spine. If anything, the final institutional turn (provost’s rapid conversion) verges on neatness, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: arrive during fallow period → enter church → climb to organ → use compass and music to open seam → retrieve nail → exit with a reconfigured pact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the protagonist’s relationship to the city and its mutiny subtly but clearly changed. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than visceral, which slightly softens the impact of the climax. Still, there is a clear before/after and a coherent accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene at the quarry, with each step (arrival, ribbon test, captain’s entrance, snag, portrait) causally tightening toward confession. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the truth of the “stunt gone wrong” surfaces and is held in the painting’s chamber of guilt and love. The only slight softness is the convenience of the captain arriving at just this moment, which reads more symbolic than pressured by prior events. Still, the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds, and cost is clear in the captain’s stilled wrists and Lio’s deliberate nonjudgment.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is strong and legible: decoding the journals enables the kite fix, which reveals the sky-river, which points to the cliff intake, which yields samples that tighten forecasts and trigger the ministry’s permission. The piece follows a clear causal spine under a lyric surface, with no orientation debt and no unkept setups. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has earned the right to leave but instead stays to inscribe Seraphine into the forecast, a choice with clear emotional and situational cost. The only slight limitation is that the external consequences of overstaying exile remain conceptual rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: disappearance → encounter with fiddler → following scaffold-wrap map → discovery → return, all under one emotional drive. Causality is soft but present, and the rules of this slightly uncanny world remain internally consistent (music, weather, and light as portals/guides). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s relationship to loss and possibility is reweighted, with the flake left behind as a visible cost. Stakes are more emotional than situational, but the before/after in the narrator’s stance is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—present at the train braided with the startup’s rise/fall—teaches its pattern early and resolves cleanly with a conceptual repricing of circles and territories. Causality is coherent: father’s loops → startup geofences → civic harm → collapse → present ritual of bills on circus cars. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when he reframes circles as self-made orbits and chooses to cross his own markers. The only thing holding it shy of elite is the relatively soft on-page cost: the emotional and ethical price is clear but never faces a single sharp, dramatic test in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense work at the observatory is interwoven with tightly anchored backstory, each reflective beat tilting the current decoding effort or relational stance. Causality is consistent and motivated—the telegram’s instructions lead to star observations, to algorithm changes guided by grief, to deciphering the temple’s message, to the radio call that delivers emotional release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the successful translation and shared reading reweight Orla’s disappearance and Mara’s silence, with the daylily recharged as a “compass for the next dark crossing.” The only thing keeping this just shy of 9+ is that the external stakes (what happens if they fail) stay relatively soft compared to the rich emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: failed magic → memory of the lake → journey → use of the seed to strip spells → revelation of the confession → unbinding the orchard and lake. Closure is strong and on-page: Issa decisively reverses the binding she once helped create, reconfiguring both the lake’s state and her stance toward truth and mirrors. Cost is legible in her confrontation with her complicity and in grinding Ren’s confession into the water, foreclosing any return to comfortable deception. Structure is a single, well-contained scene without orientation debt or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: future arrives early → covenant pressure awakens → maze is activated via the body → linking scars opens the dream-room → covenant realigns. Causality holds in a lyric mode, and the closure beat—stepping into the shared wind as bound door-figures—registers as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (remaining threaded to all travelers). Orientation is solid early on (who, where, when, what pressure) despite the density of metaphor. The main limitation is that the exact consequences of failure are more implied than dramatized, keeping the stakes slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal throughline—from entering the orchard with the burned card, to confronting the Keeper, to offering her “method” and accepting the scars of regrafting—is coherent and satisfying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the market’s role is reconceived, the brother’s path is regrafted, and the narrator’s vow (“promising never again to bargain alone”) forecloses her old solitary bravado. The drive is largely Hybrid, with causal beats embedded in an accumulative lyric pattern that remains legible. Stakes are mostly interior/ethical rather than perilous, but the cost of shared scars and shared breath reads clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival → object discovery → deeper evidence (drawer, photos, map, set list) → realization of personal link → decision about Echo Bench. Causality holds tightly; each physical find escalates knowledge and forces a sharper stance on whether this is just a job or a reckoning with Abel and failure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his task from salvaging an amp for value to midwifing a story and his own purpose, with the valley’s “answer” crystallizing that. Stakes are mostly internal but legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent and purposeful: climbing, ritual, coil/fruit emergence, and translation all build toward a conceptual shift. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: she abandons the fantasy of reversal and redefines her project as tuning a transitional physics “so the living can listen without harm.” Cost is legible in her renunciation of mastery and rescue, and this before/after is crystallized in the reestablished orchard-as-commons. Causality is lyrical rather than mechanical, but beats follow a steady because/therefore logic within the established world-rules.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is well taught from the opening and holds: the piece moves from premise → baker → boy → dusk/closure with clean transitions. The central drive—how to live and locate self after “tomorrow disappears”—is consistently advanced through each visitor’s micro-story. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “There is no tomorrow to chase, only the next tide” reframes all prior images with conceptual cost. Escalation is gentle but legible; there are no causality breaks or orientation lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: descent → inspection setup → discovery of the shell → deepening via confessions → hesitation → crowning and reconfigured protocol. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: each new layer of the cave’s and bunker’s history pushes her toward a stance, and the crowning is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual and implied professional cost. Orientation is solid from line one (who/where/what) and never wavers. The only constraint at this level is that the external consequences of defiance remain mostly implied rather than partially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is cleanly causal under a single, continuous scene: graffiti → WSP realization → portal opening → physical and verbal confession → new ongoing obligation. The dominant drive—owning responsibility for the boy’s death—tightens as new information appears (WSP, graffiti, mapping errors) and culminates in a decisive behavioral change. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis: she revises her atlas, accepts enduring, unclosed guilt, and commits to future blunt chronicling. Cost is legible in her refusal of absolution and in the way the final image frames her burden as ongoing work, not solved pain.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: first letter → journey via cipher → library encounter → self-authored second letter, all under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is intact—the cipher and watch dictate tactics, and the closure (writing and receiving the second letter) functions as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in self-understanding. The main limitation is the relatively gentle pressure; no moment seriously threatens failure or loss, so the sense of cost at closure is more conceptual than felt. Still, the arc between the “two fateful letters” is elegantly completed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation is swift, the pressure builds through coffee-stain divination and plant counsel, and culminates in the choice to play and then to carry the melted violin to the river. Causality is coherent under a lyric logic—each prior element (telepathy, coffee, pledge) pays off in the climax. Closure lands as both Decisive Change (destroying the artifact/leaving the observatory) and Conceptual Repricing (heritage vs theft reweighted through living networks). The cost—career, artifact, and safety—is legible in her quiet departure and the director’s baffled pause.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from establishing her role and the grotto’s rules to the test case of her mother, the ritual, and a renewed pledge. Causality within the lyric frame holds—her learned method, the emerald, and the aurora’s behavior all feed the climax where she captures a last spark. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she reframes her work after passing through this personal trial. The only limit is that failure or an alternate outcome never feels like a truly live possibility, which softens the perceived cost of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent and taught early; causality is more emotional than event-driven but consistent. Orientation is clean: we know who, where, and in what after-state we are very quickly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final beats with the tendril, shirt strip, and hairpin reconceive forgiveness/contentment as ongoing small acts with a visible cost of vigilance and restraint. There are no dropped set-ups or structural stumbles at this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    This is a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: we move from arrival to method set-up, to interpretive “reading,” to cloak removal, and finally to a reconfigured plan and parting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara leaves with a specific way to sign that preserves doubt as an active constraint, and the narrator keeps the shard as a literalized change in their ledger. Stakes and turns are mostly internal and conversational, without a sharp external reversal, but the cloak beats and chime sequences provide enough cadence shifts to make a before/after legible. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and the cost—Mara must still carry the burden of a complicated decision—is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the scene is one continuous ritual in which small moves (breathing, pebble, watching ripples) gradually reweight the central question of presence versus effect. Orientation is clean early—who, where, and why they’ve met are clear—and the withheld explanation is structurally consistent with the “delayed revelation” concept. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: the final understanding (“presence could be measured by effect alone” and “Stay only as long as you matter to the pattern”) retrofits all prior beats, with the researcher’s disappearance as cost. The only limiting factor is that plot pressure stays meditative rather than sharply escalating, which keeps the structural tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tap → locate wandering pulse → discover boundary of forgetting → negotiate → guide the pulse back into a channel, yielding a new status. Causality is internally consistent within the metaphoric rules: traders’ bargain → exiled pulse → protagonist’s reverent audit enables reintegration. Orientation (who/where/what is happening) is established very early and the drive lens (accumulative/textural ritual) holds through closure. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration—the pulse becomes guide instead of prisoner—with a clear before/after and no unresolved structural debts at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: dissatisfaction → ascent via mist walking → encounter with the keystone → renunciation of assistive charms → reoriented practice back home. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the mage’s relationship to magic and value has a clear before/after, with the cost of turning away from automated genius on the page. Structure is linear and coherent; reflection is well-anchored in present stimuli (frost, light, cold). Stakes remain intimate rather than sharply pressured, but that suits the accumulative/lyric drive and doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative lyric surface: lamplighting → cover of the lantern release → clandestine dive → discovery that the tag is a tuning plate → vow/offering → reconfigured return. Closure lands as a decisive internal change (truth as door, listening begun) with implied physical risk and a relinquished old stance. The spine never tangles, and the wreck sequence pays off everything seeded in the harbor. Stakes are primarily internal and could be marginally sharper on the page, but they cohere and carry cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: preparing coolant, consulting the backwards prophecy, first cast/interpretation, then the second cast with explicit options culminating in the tuned “hello.” Causality under a textural lens is tight—each ritual action changes what’s possible next (coolant enables arrays; coin geometry shapes reception; interpretation adjusts their message). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they exit the backward song “angled toward beginning,” having paid with their last drips of amber and a commitment to non-steering randomness. The only slight check is that the global cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete consequence beyond “last drips,” which keeps it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure (each tape → monster → naming) is coherent and causally linked, with the observatory frame holding everything together. Orientation (who/where/what’s happening) is quickly clear despite the lyricism. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the reaper applies their naming practice to themselves and seals it by folding the atlas and departing, with the observatory “keeping” the lexicon. Stakes and cost (accepting responsibility and shared heartbreak) are legible on the page, though the conflict is more textural than decisively turned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual that accumulates cause and effect: bell placement → drip-counting → Aro’s confession → tuning → ringing → seam opening → vow not to fish. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with solid causal threads, and closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s relation to the tide is altered and their stance toward fishing changes with clear cost. No orientation issues; stakes and spatial logic remain legible throughout. The only limit is that the pressure curve is relatively gentle, more contemplative than driven, which keeps it just shy of the most explosive closure tier.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is tight: the resurfaced town → glinting label → breadcrumb photographs → encounter with the keeper → communal memorial line → oath. Causality is clean under a textural lens, with each discovered object and story reweighting the narrator’s options toward defiance of “expunging” the past. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines “warden” from pure enforcement to guardian of lore, with the concrete cost of disobeying orders implied. The before/after is legible and charged without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival with a clear motive, ritual with crystal and flame, the murmuration as epistemic event, then a reweighted stance at the end. Causality holds under a textural lens—each new element (flame, birds, ratios) deepens the same central question rather than branching into new threads. Closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: she trades a neat answer for a new way of asking and a deferred “final firing,” with the starlings’ return as the future hinge. The cost—accepting delay and uncertainty—could be made slightly more concrete, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clear: unusual approach → misread gusts and resisted signal → revealed harness failure → guided repair → adjusted landing → post-mortem recommitment. Drive lens reads primarily causal with strong accumulative texture, and closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise where the narrator recommits to the role while feeling its cost (“until someone better learns the arbor”). Stakes and before/after are legible, and all key set-ups (buckle, muscle memory, trust) are paid off on page. It stops just shy of 9+ because the emotional/ethical cost at the end, while real, remains more implicit than fully crystallized in one decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative arc: the scheduled hearing → the jar as witness → the demand to vivify → the brain’s testimony → the kata → the verdict and internal shift. Causality is clean within its lyric frame: Kana’s act enables the brain’s revelation, which reframes ownership, prompting the communal kata that crystallizes the verdict. Closure is strong: Kana’s numbness “cracked” and her new role as “door on both hinges” marks a decisive before/after with cost. The only limit at this level is that some high-concept moves (e.g., legal mechanics of the verdict) stay impressionistic rather than sharply tested in concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mystery mail → planting → design of the room → community activation → pressure from developers → confirming letter from Mae → ongoing defense of the brook, with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure in “the flow of future…protected by a single seed.” Structure is accumulative but coherent, with time passing in lucid, motivated ellipsis. The main limitation is that most key confrontations and costs (investors, legal and social pushback) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so the decisive turns feel a bit soft-focus. Still, closure is undeniable and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is very clear: arrival → descent → tuning/ritual → partial restoration → departure, with each step causally linked. The global drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the house’s air is changed, with a visible conceptual cost in withheld laughter. Orientation is solid from the opening; the surreal rules are taught early and remain consistent. The only thing holding this shy of the very top is that the decisive “turn” feels more like a beautifully executed completion of ritual than a surprising structural shift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, lyric pattern early and adheres to it, with a clean throughline: arrival → initiation (pendant) → deepening (waiting, interiorizing exteriors) → test (path and window) → Earned Stasis in the shared decision not to cross. Causality is clear within the dream-logic frame: each object or method introduced (pendant, comma of ice, sundial) leads to a new layer of access or knowledge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the guardian’s old sky is regained but not entered, and the narrator’s relationship to uncertainty is tangibly altered. If anything, the story edges toward conceptual rather than situational pressure, which keeps the stakes exquisite but slightly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/causal arc: repeated alchemical attempts, each failure tightening pressure, lead to the conceptual pivot of vivifying vacancy rather than object. Closure is strong and on-page: the crozier becomes a loop of nothing, the clock and mills falter, and the men’s certainty drains away, clearly marking a before/after with social and symbolic cost. Orientation is solid from the start (who/where/when are quickly legible) and the drive lens remains coherent through the end. The quiet, ongoing “successive approximation” promise in the last lines feels like an earned stasis rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent and purposeful: constructing the device, choosing where to aim, receiving the signal, and discovering the cave’s resource all build to a Conceptual Repricing of the city as “a receiver shaped like goodbye.” Causality within the lyric mode is tight—mentor’s method directly informs the decisive choice to aim “at the space between swing and stillness,” which unlocks the central revelation. Closure lands cleanly with the instruction “Pour the beginnings into the endings,” reconfiguring prior images and the city’s role, though the cost of that next step remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and the drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal threads) is stable to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation and pattern are taught early and clearly: ferry, estuary, fog/sideways clocks, then the spectral grotto as a second-stage setting; the causal throughline (radio call → meeting → ritual → sacrifice) is clean. The closure unit is a decisive change with visible cost: one self becomes the permanent “hinge” while the other returns to embodied life and restores the ferry’s schedule. The accumulative, lyric texture supports a Hybrid drive lens without losing coherence, and set-ups (hourglass, vanishing ferry, sideways time) pay off structurally. The only structural softness is that the larger consequences for the city and timelines are left suggestive rather than concretely dramatized, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: preparation → early visitors as test cases → activation of the central installation → personal confrontation and reconfiguration. Cause-and-effect is soft but coherent under a textural lens: threading sinew awakens the arena, which in turn externalizes her unresolved departure from her lover. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she revises the function of her work from shield to experiment in mutual risk—and the cost (relinquishing self-protective logic) is legible. No orientation debt; the single-evening frame and spatial stakes remain clear even within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: teaching with the ring → discovery of the pressure-gap corridor via edge geometry → petition and approval → training → ascent. The closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they commit to a dangerous new vector (rising toward the surface sky) while the city’s cost and risk remain palpable. Some key turns—especially the council petition and the weeks of practice—are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly mutes their pressure. Orientation is clear from the outset; no lens or timeline confusion undermines closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clear causal spine—she goes to meet Eli, uses the hearing aid to track him, confronts the pills and the predatory “man in the suit,” then the glass-panel near-accident closes the physical danger while reconfiguring their bond. The drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal: the dead-call texture frames everything, but each move (“I raise the aid…”, mobilizing bystanders) produces concrete next steps. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eli has foreclosed, at least for now, the suicide path, pockets the photograph, and the “borrowed heart keeps its own steady counsel,” with the conceptual cost of living with that debt. If anything, the glass panel’s timing feels slightly convenient, but it still operates more as escalation and metaphor than deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wait for slack tide → enter → coax signal → brief contact → promised return, all under the tidal clock. Causality is intact within a lyric frame, and the closure (an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) reconfigures the vigil as an ongoing commitment rather than a solved problem. Cost is legible in his limited window and the acceptance that he will keep risking himself for a non-ownable, fragile “presence” in the cables. A slightly more acute mid-story tightening of options could push this toward truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense return to the observatory, then deepening via the misfiled death and near-freezing, then the ink-reading that reveals a new “corridor” and a resolved plan to descend and confront the clerks. Causality operates through emotional and conceptual turns rather than external plot, but each step is a clear “because/therefore” (ghost speaks → ink patterns → remembered corridor → decision to carry the map and shard down). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator gains a new way to breathe and walk, a concrete mission, and a reframed relationship to both the place and the error. Cost is legible in the acceptance of continued vulnerability (descending with only “weatherproof wisdom” and a shard) rather than any neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival → learning to read birds → using the diamond → escalating sacrifices → final transformation, all under one continuous scene. Causality is clear in lyric terms (because the language is dying and the tunnel of echoes can preserve it, the narrator uses the cursed diamond and pays in names). Closure lands solidly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator moves from carrier to instrument, with a felt cost in self-erasure and physical transformation. There are no discernible orientation debts; the rules of this strange world are taught through action and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: phone → instruction → ritual with arrow and willow → cryptid’s appearance → vow. Causality is intact and legible even within the lyric texture, and orientation (who/where/why) is anchored early through the “herbalist’s underground garden” and the city’s changed returns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her undercover “cover” becomes a vow with city-wide cost, and the arrowhead’s function is decisively altered. The only brake on a higher score is that the external city-stakes stay mostly conceptual rather than tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is coherent and legible: refusal to keep “performing,” descent into the orchard, experimental performance, orchard and statues responding, rails uprooted, and a poised aftermath. The structure feels like a single accumulating scene with a clear before/after for both the orchard and the protagonist’s role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules are visibly altered and the cost is foreshadowed by tomorrow’s inspectors. The only restraint on an even higher score is that institutional pushback and danger remain projected rather than partially tasted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from individual delivery, through the risky crossing and tactical use of the storm, to the establishment and defense of the twilight gathering. Causality is intact—drones and checkpoints dictate routes, the bottle resolves the bridge pinch point, and the joint ledger work logically leads to designing the cobalt arcade rendezvous. The closure (a natural storm rising, border humming a “smaller song”) is a resonant reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible: their quiet system has shifted the border’s behavior at a conceptual cost of ongoing risk. Nothing vital is summarized offstage, and transitions across nights are clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: search for a missing crown piece → wrong turn → oasis discovery → retrieval and installation → first shiver of renewed motion. Causality is clear even in this lyric mode, with each step arising from the previous (listening to rails, following chalk arrows, squeezing between cars). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the carousel is not fully restored, but a decisive threshold is crossed with the crown’s gleam and his ongoing plan. Cost is mostly conceptual and temporal rather than immediate jeopardy, but it’s present in his solitary, labor-intensive commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the scarf tug/atlas slot is the inciting opening, the non-Euclidean walk and “curvature of welcome” are the middle deepening, and the lung-room plus return to the desk form a clean Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is lucid within the poetic rules (chalk ticket through slot → library reshapes itself to the present need), and there are no orientation debts; the accumulative pattern is taught early and held. Closure lands: before, the librarian is seeking the place where stories live; after, they accept belonging to the stories’ “weather and measure,” with the cost of ongoing duty and relinquished ownership. The only thing holding this just under 9.0 is that the cost remains conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in a singular, pressured decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: opening in the library → pursuit to Sibilant Key → gallery return, all under the drive of recapturing the dream. Causality is consistent (dream escaped → must be documented at first light → sunrise photography creates the “bridge”), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the librarian leaves “the door unlatched.” Cost is legible in the refusal to imprison the dream and in accepting Aria’s presence as absence rather than body. The only restraint is that escalation reads more as deepening pattern than as a sharply articulated turn, which slightly softens the impact band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: call → descent → ritual with star and hair → opening → emergence with idea in hand. Causality is consistent under an accumulative/textural lens: each symbolic act (hair, star, listening) advances toward unlocking the idea. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the scholar’s stance toward their own longing changes, and the valley’s “dignity” and the empty box image reweight what containers and doors mean. Cost—years of self-denial and the ache of finally touching that mercy—is legible in the final passages.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: return → exploration → engagement with the ring → memory-film → correction of the wrong name → re-integration of memories and debt payment. Causality under the lyric surface is coherent—touching the ring produces the fragments; naming corrects the bargain; this in turn frees both narrator and greenhouse from the mispronunciation. Closure lands strongly as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing of bargains and names, with on-page cost in the form of confronting painful nostalgia. Escalation is quiet but steady; one could imagine a slightly sharper sense of risk or time pressure to push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrival of the girl and jar → tea-leaf reading → hinge glyph and hush → binding annotations → brother’s return → archivist’s quiet renunciation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the archivist remains in exile but recommits to “teach the hinge to others,” a before/after stance with evident cost. The world rules around the hush, aisles, and annotations are consistent and pay off. The only small restraint is that the process unfolds almost too smoothly, with little overt risk of failure beyond tonal implication.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a coherent causal arc: Gray drains color, the pruner learns of the door, crosses into the echo orchard, gathers essences, and offers them to Gray, leading to transformation and communal practice. Closure is strong: the valley’s relationship to Gray and to color is reconfigured, with an earned sense of ongoing cost in tending and teaching. That said, resistance is minimal—Gray’s acceptance of succor comes easily, and no attempt meaningfully fails—so the decisive change, while clear, feels relatively low-friction. The accumulative, mythic structure is well handled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal beneath the lyric surface: daughter arrives with shattered mask → need to ground the spirit → exhume coffer by untying knots → raise and rebury coffer while repairing mask. The accumulative untying sequence escalates smoothly into the coffer’s emergence and naming, then resolves in a settled, reweighted quiet. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fisherman’s spirit is grounded, and the sanctuary’s silence is altered by his laugh. No orientation or lens-clarity issues undermine the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged map → curiosity about the tear → visit to the chapel → problem of the sealed panel → research via silent footage → precise, gentle opening → discovery and reconfiguration of practice. The piece functions on a largely accumulative/textural lens, but the beats still follow a legible because/therefore logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s work is permanently reweighted by the chapel’s ethic of gentleness, with the cost being the self-imposed limit on intrusion. The stakes and change are quiet yet coherent, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: exploration → discovery of recorder → decoding the last transmission → thematic realization → ritual response. Closure lands sharply in the paired acts of leaving a note and releasing the globe—an on-page conceptual repricing of “letting go” with evident emotional cost. The ship’s danger and time constraints are implied rather than dramatized, so situational stakes are a touch soft, but they don’t undercut coherence. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence and the throughline never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: preparation → invocation during the lightning–thunder interval → contact with the ghost → encoded requests → the ghost’s limited but concrete civic interventions and promised patch. Causality within this lyric mode holds: the storm window enables access, the grounded paint carries the message, and the ghost’s reply logically follows from sampling those currents. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration as the mural and plate become an ongoing interface, and the ghost commits to “a breathing schedule they cannot ignore,” with the cost being the narrator’s labor, risk, and continued semi-invisibility. The only reason this doesn’t break 9 is that temporal pressure and personal risk, though legible, remain relatively soft-edged rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: the ascent through ten floors provides a temporal and structural spine, with the diary discovery as inciting incident and the forgetter room as closure. Causality is subtle but sound—diary falls, goggles enable reading, knowledge reframes the delivery, and the protagonist’s final act fulfills but complicates the original errand. The closure beat (leaving both goggles and diary, watching the letters “settle into sleep”) lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with clear before/after. A minor limitation is that some mid-elevator beats echo each other texturally rather than adding distinct new pressures, but the overall arc still tightens toward the final room.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from inciting loss (the broken string and fall) through iterative “experiments” (cloud taxonomy, tracing the wake, tying the line) to a reweighted understanding at dawn. Causality is lyrical but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: each new method intensifies the same drive rather than veering off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the acceptance that the sky is “a loom” and absence “yarn”—with clear conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is strong from early on (who, where, what happened), and the piece maintains one continuous window without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is very clean: enter on the demolition hush, locate the safe, decode the coin, paint according to the map, leave a note, step back into closure. Causality is tight under a textural lens—the coin’s pattern dictates the painting’s development, the demolition timeline deepens pressure, and each beat enlarges the same drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library becomes “a portrait of days before faces,” the sky is reconceived as within, and the cost (the doomed building, the artist’s acceptance) is palpable. Orientation is clear from early on; there are no causality gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: rumor → clue (dog-ear) → interpreting the hopscotch → finding the stranded luminance → capturing/harboring it in the dog-ear, with each step causally linked. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a solid causal backbone, and the closure (the light re-housed and mapped) is legible as a conceptual reconfiguration. The main weakness is the softness of on-page cost; everything works the first time, and nothing truly threatens failure or loss. Still, for a lyric piece, the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: climb → exploration → deciphering prophecies → mirror work → story-telling climax → quiet exit, with each movement deepening the same drive rather than executing sharp causal reversals. Causality is nonetheless coherent: reading the fragments informs his tactics; applying oil and telling the story awaken the machine; the library’s response and his final note close the loop. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of repair and his craft), with the before/after legible in both the reanimated library and his altered understanding. The cost is subtle but present as emotional labor and renunciation of triumph, which fits the mode but keeps the piece from feeling structurally urgent enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clear and intact: drought and despair → mysterious instructions → communal relay under arches → climactic ascent and tipping of the bell → nebula’s descent → redefinition of “haunting” and rest. Structure is accumulative but logically sequenced, with no orientation issues and one coherent throughline of action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules and the narrator’s understanding of haunting are reweighted with an earned sense of cost and relief. The drought, communal fatigue, and the need to keep moving prevent the ending from feeling like an unearned miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: description of role → present-night ritual → key turn and lullaby → reconfigured calm with a charged final image. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: panels/pendulum/lens check lead into storm glass darkening, then the nested-pattern sequence, then the reprieve. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse’s beacon is reframed “not to warn but to welcome,” and the lullaby is scattered to “sleepers yet unborn,” with the cost of his ongoing solitary service implicit. Stakes remain slightly abstract (we never truly feel the possibility of failure or refusal tonight), keeping this just below 9-level.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: orientation to the role and curse, the arrival of travelers, the tactical navigation, and the final renunciation all flow coherently. Causality is strong under a textural lens: the nut’s blueprint insight directly enables the “assembled” path and the manipulation of birds’ perceptions. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: the caretaker chooses continued self-erasure in full awareness of the orchard’s civil curse. The cost is legible in “leaving myself behind where no one could touch,” anchoring a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: leaving the lab → studying the ravine → designing polymers → building the bridge → summoning the brother → crossing together, all in service of atonement. Reflection is always anchored in present stimuli (rivers, chrysalis, instruments) and tilts subsequent choices rather than pausing the story. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship is not “solved,” but their options are reweighted as they share the bridge and let the chrysalis go, with cost acknowledged. There are no orientation or logic slips, and the piece fits comfortably as a single-scene-with-memory arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: opening orientation to the orchard-booth, first transaction with the woman, then the narrator turning the same method inward, with each step logically building on the last. “By quantifying absence” and using moonlight as a measuring tool give the piece a stable procedural spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator spends their own absence and hears their “first breath, mine, unborrowed,” clearly marking a before/after with cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays consistent and there are no causality or orientation slips, though the stakes remain quietly internal rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rain → reading the pools → journey → pavilion → cooking → return, with each step deepening the central task rather than meandering. Causality is coherent and legible under a textural lens, and the final shift in the city’s emotional “weather” provides a resonant reconfiguration with a modest but real felt cost. The closure image of the walls’ unchanged yet recharged “sturdy brittle” tone works, but the personal cost to the narrator is somewhat underplayed, keeping this just short of exceptional. Orientation is solid from the first lines; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/lyric structure cleanly: clock tower → dialogue with the elevator → choir mobilization → councilman’s entrance → bridge completion is a clear escalation. Causality is intact (her decision to answer and to ritualize the work leads to community action and literal bridge-building), and closure is legible in the final images of the bridge and the redefined “measure.” However, the resistance is soft—the councilman’s reversal on finding the glove feels almost too easy, lowering the sense of cost. The drive lens (textural accumulation toward a conceptual repricing of “measure” and “silos”) holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: ritual setup → iterative memory seams → hardest ethical layer → dawn packing that signals a new stance. Causality operates cleanly under a textural drive lens—each adjustment of the machine or mirror triggers a deeper stratum of shared history. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, but the shift from “protecting the fossil” to “excavating gently” with visible limits reads as a before/after with cost. The stakes and transformation stay tightly tied to this single canyon-night window, avoiding outline-like summary.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: gravity’s inversion opens access → traversal of the grotto → deciphering the panel → retrieval of tokens → forced exit as time runs out. The story delivers a clear closure unit (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis): leaving with “a handful” of combinations while committing to return, with the hour’s limit as visible cost. Structure is linear and well-contained in a single scene, with no orientation debt despite the lyricism. Escalation is modest but coherent, with the main tightening being the deepening into the chamber and the impending end of the inverted hour.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous session in the grove, deepened by a single reflective shard about the fallen museum that directly informs present method. Causality is soft but coherent: past study of stress cracks → mapped “grammar” → current tuning practice → offering the resulting phrase to river, hedgehog, grove. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cyclical promise to return, contingent on continued gentleness and truth, delineates a before/after stance in how the world is heard. Cost is conceptual and quiet—the acceptance of a life devoted to small, patient listening—but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural ritual scene with a clear before/after: when they begin, the covenant is eclipsed; by the end, the rail sings and the needle rises, acknowledging them as keepers. Causality is coherent within its mythic frame: they choose a method (board, needle, birds, silence), enact it stepwise, and the environment responds. Stakes—the risk of being recorded as oathbreakers, past failure, and the city’s hostility to listening—are clear but remain more atmospheric than concretely tested (no interruption, no near-failure). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (the ongoing danger and responsibility), though that cost is felt more intellectually than through a sharp, on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: initial stillness → rigging the clasp → progressive tuning and cataloging → the clasp’s opening → fireworks beginning as a counterpoint. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each successive silence deepens the project until the object yields and redefines the narrator’s understanding of what was “recovered.” Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the absence of text, the fennel sprig, and the lexicon of silences conceptually reprice spectacle and harm with a cost in relinquished narrative and fireworks-centric drama. The before/after is legible: from seeking the fireworks master’s pause to inhabiting a charged, patient “wiser noise.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: seed → planting → vigil → storms/panic → bloom-ceremony → reflective repricing. Causality is coherent and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the village’s relation to motion, fear, and smell is reweighted with visible cost (enduring the stench together). Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and the pattern of lyric compression is taught early and maintained. If anything, the long middle braid of seasons could use one more concrete complication or setback before the smoothly successful ceremony to heighten felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: weekly gravity inversion → launch → follow water/echoes → discover damaged chamber → use heirloom to repair it, leading to planetary and personal reconfiguration. Closure lands decisively with the shard’s insertion and the orchards’ temporal whiplash of fruit/flower/fruit, which clearly marks a before/after. The cost is primarily conceptual and physical-risk implied rather than dramatized resistance, but it’s still legible. Structure stays within a single escalating event without drift or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal throughline—survey → reconstruction of the test flight → identification of the empty square and storm → procedural redesign—reads clean and inevitable. Closure lands in the shift from postmortem to proactive grid: a conceptual repricing of the port as a “lung” that must be engineered, not trusted. The cost is the silent town and dead workers, held in the background but undeniably present in the final, quieter test of the wind. Escalation is modest but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: preparation in the cavern, alignment with the sculptor’s first strike, the ritual unfettering of the hush, and a quiet but clear closure with the hush as companion. Causal links inside the lyric mode are sound (bells → colored hush → support for the sculptor’s courage), and the single key hinge—her bell strike synched with the chisel—lands. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: wonder is successfully “certified” in the form of a living hush that can travel back into the city. The main weakness is that the supposedly world-level stakes and the council’s demands never quite impose concrete, on-page cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: journey into canyon → ritual with driftwood → playing the flute → twin valley confrontation → reoriented markers and new destination. Causality under a textural lens holds: her decision to play differently (“not to cross, but to hear”) produces the loom-like corridor, which in turn enables the reevaluation of her past failure and a new vow. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the markers literally shift direction and her mission reframes from guarding to witnessing, with the cost of surrendering former status baked in. Orientation is solid from the opening; no scene-level confusion or late rule-changes undermine the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: night in the Topaz workshop, recurring beat of vanishing stars as a clock, increasingly elaborate applications of “transposed empathy,” culminating in the decisive printing experiment. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—the quickening vanishings and prior trials push them to set “the line that will not lie,” producing the theorem and mutual relief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they reprice emotion as a sharable, quasi-physical quantity, and the cost (scratches, risk of self-loss, the dying sky) remains live even as their stance toward it changes. Orientation is solidly anchored early; experimentation never muddies who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight: journey → cairn singer (pattern teaching) → client encounter → near-overuse → renunciation and continuation. Causality is clean under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: the pendant’s function, the woman’s need, and the mentor’s method all converge in the central ritual, which drives the later ethical choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator commits to “notice, invite, release” with a clearer sense of cost and of the mentor’s absence/presence. Nothing crucial feels unkept or teleported, and the reflective shards remain anchored in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive at arbor → set up experiment → ritual with prism and frost → father-naming/apology beat → kitchen coda that reweights meaning. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens; each step (heater, frost, prism, question, name) deepens the same line of pressure rather than side-stepping it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: by the final line, the narrator’s relationship to objects—and to his father’s unspoken apology—has irreversibly shifted with clear cost. Orientation (who/where/what they’re doing) is precise from the outset and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: ritual preparation → opening of the frame → near-crossing and renunciation → long wait → sister’s return, all under a tight causal and symbolic logic. The closure (bead succeeds; sister returns with it) lands clearly with a felt cost in the years of waiting and the risked/averted self-sacrifice. Orientation is strong from the first line, and the world’s rules are introduced through action rather than exposition. The only slight limit is that the long waiting period is summarized rather than dramatized in intermediate beats, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arches sinking → decision to act → successive repairs with escalating costs → rebalanced world and reconfigured self-understanding. The three-anchor structure offers clear, legible progression, and the barters provide a persistent constraint that shapes tactics. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the world is still fragile but now inhabitable by deliberate work, with the narrator shorn of some memories and voice. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities; the hybrid causal/lyric drive holds smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clear and accumulative: arrival at the bay → tracking the coolant scent and shard resonance → reading the repair log → testing the crate across parallel universes → releasing and redirecting the voices. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural core; each pass through universes adds density to the central question of what withheld truth does to a place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—the narrator reframes their purpose from seeker of secrets to distributor of weight—with on-page consequence (the voices disseminated, the shard left as a tool for “later menders”). The only structural shortfall is that the risk of releasing the voices feels under-tested; no serious on-page obstacle resists the protagonist’s final course.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: present-tense final run framed by remembered routines and the emergence of the letter chain. Causality is soft but coherent: automation and the threat of archival erasure drive the skipper’s choice to transform the letters and sea glass into a new kind of lantern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the jar under the last rung redefines what “keeping the light” means, with the cost of his obsolescence and unnamed solitude clearly felt. Stakes stay intimate and conceptual rather than plot-driven, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean under a mostly causal lens: premature laugh → gyre reorients toward harbor → she alters the wick and beam → storm is re-routed to irrigate instead of drown. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early despite the lyric mode, and the technical-mythic rules around the wick and beam are internally consistent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the core drive—to be a herald shaping tomorrow’s “news”—lands with cost in her ongoing responsibility and in the way her laughter can endanger as well as save. The only reason this is not higher is that the cost remains conceptual and quiet rather than sharply dramatized in an irrevocable on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative and coherent: each concrete action (pouring, drawing sun trails, tilting the mirror, handing over the wing) deepens the central inquiry rather than wandering. Orientation is clean from the opening: we know about the donor heart, the floating tea house, and the narrator’s intention within the first lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator leaves with a new stance toward the heart and storytelling, crystallized in following the “sun trails home” while the heart “answered.” Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the before/after line in self-understanding is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: maintenance routine → dream-mapping → the pin’s fall → rooftop exchange with trees → quiet return, all under one drive to translate sorrow into comprehensible form. Causality is soft but consistent, with the pin and sextant providing legible turns and the rooftop scene functioning as a resonant reconfiguration of what “maps” and “witnessing” mean. Closure is on-page and conceptually costly: the narrator accepts a lifetime of maintenance as a form of shared witnessing and healing. The only limitation is the relatively low external pressure; nothing truly forces the timing of this night beyond atmospheric “fragile hour” language.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from general practice, to remembered failure, to the climactic attempt for the last village, to rekindling the sky. Causality is coherent under a lyric lens—songs → mica loosening → dawn threads → woven sky—and the prior storm failure directly informs present stakes and tactics. Closure is strong: the decisive change from endless night to dawn arrives on the page with a visible before/after and personal cost (“I am emptied and full”). The only slight limitation is the inevitability of success; there’s little sense that failure remains a live option once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clear and satisfying: error → guilt → invitation → secret library → paradox training → reframed understanding → concrete reparative action. The accumulative, lyric mode supports a closure that is a resonant reconfiguration—Mara now walks to the door with “error cherished,” making a before/after legible with emotional cost. The portal transition (laundromat to hidden library) is legible and doesn’t break the frame; each fantastical move follows from the prior beat. Stakes and closure are proportionate to length, though the external confrontation remains just off-page, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: arrive → uncloak and tend → share tea and confessions → partial recloaking and renewed commitment. Causality is coherent at the lyric level (they come because of creeping losses; they act to reclaim a space; the ritual leads to a redefined sense of what they’re protecting). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “what we protect is an ability to notice together” plus the seasonal vow provides a legible before/after in stance, with a cost in accepting incompleteness and ongoing labor. The main limitation is that the external stakes remain low-pressure and symbolic; no single decisive beat forces a structural turn so much as a graceful tapering into charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure moves cleanly from procedure (measuring others’ vows) through illustrative cases to the narrator’s personal vow and a charged, contemplative stasis. Each example beat (wedding, river stewardship, scribes’ oath) tightens the frame on what can be saved and at what cost, so the final testing of the narrator’s own promise reads as an inevitable culmination. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: they accept that “meaning keeps arriving like weather” and choose to stay, with the cost of ongoing exposure to loss and partial failure. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early and never breaks, with no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is clean: one continuous, well-oriented scene that escalates through silence, bargaining, and micro-failures into an earned, quiet closure. The accumulative drive is clear—each false start and pause builds toward the captured buckle and the final understanding—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where she leaves with proof instead of retribution. Causality holds tightly: her deliberate stalling tactics unravel his composure and produce the sound she’s hunting. The cost—relinquishing revenge, accepting a non-absolving proof, and leaving him alive with his guilt—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival → waiting with the “election” forest → convergence of carriers → ring-triggered ritual at the spine → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but legible under the chosen lens: taste signals lead to map → decision to move to the spine → communal release of weather and settling of the count. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing, with the skeptic’s stance reweighted and the world-rule (weather as memory) enacted. The only limitation is that the risk of failure for the election/ritual remains implied rather than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: descent into the cave → attempt at the fake combination lock → discovery of Lio’s contingency → opening the niche → renewed drawing. Causality holds and each beat flows from the last under an accumulative/textural drive. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator redefines the studio and grief, emerging with the book and key. The cost—facing loss and accepting that this calling will not relent—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine under an accumulative/textural surface: vanishing words → postal fragment → map → Ear → confession → corridor → spindle and vine. Each step arises logically from the last, and the rules of the world (lost conversations stored and traded, the Ear requiring candor as payment) are established through action rather than exposition. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “lost” conversations were deferred, awaiting an honest escort, reweighting the earlier mystery and the narrator’s honesty-obsession with visible conceptual cost. The only small limitation is that external stakes remain relatively contained and interior, so the sense of narrowed options under pressure is strong but not overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival at the bluff → tuning with the fragment → symphonies of truth affecting villagers → integration of water → quiet vigil and coda. Causality is clear even in lyric mode (the fragment’s placement, its glisten, its melting all drive subsequent beats). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the village accepts being “tuned,” the aurora restored, the fragment’s cost folded into the bells. Stakes remain modestly scaled, but the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: magnetic shift threatens the dome → caretaker chooses controlled burn → burn creates breach → escape and reseeding follow. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost, even as the language grows metaphorical. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the dome collapses, the archive’s mode of being is irrevocably altered, and the protagonist’s tactics and inner stance are reconfigured. The only minor limitation is that the external stakes (what happens to the wider world or designer) are kept abstract, so the plot’s scope feels intentionally narrow rather than fully panoramic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The locked mailbox mystery provides a clean throughline: locket → half-moon → community storytelling → unlocking → letters. The accumulative structure of memories and objects is coherent, and the closure beat—with the box opening and the letters reconfiguring relationships—lands clearly with cost and change. There are minor conveniences (the locket’s timely appearance in the bin, Maria’s note addressed to a narrator she’s never met) that feel a bit preordained. Nonetheless, causal and textural logic holds under pressure and the ending feels structurally satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: return to the lab → seeding the code into “routine” entries → teaching the daemon → liberation and ascent, all causally linked under the lyric surface. Orientation is strong despite the density; we quickly understand who, where, and what the stakes are. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the system now carries rebellion outward through seemingly banal logs, with the cost of Sora’s death and the narrator’s ongoing risk baked in. The escalation is more atmospheric than incident-driven, so the climax never quite tightens into a sharp dilemma, which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: whale→licensed forgetting→Ilya’s lack→grounds→chamber→cube→voice→whale altar is legible and causally cohesive under a lyric, textural lens. Closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s erased memories are literally voiced back through the whale, with Ilya’s actions as hinge. Stakes and rules are introduced early and paid off (gravity pockets, salt as memory medium, dreamworks vs. crystals) without late-breaking cheats. If anything keeps it just under 9, it’s that the emotional cost to Ilya personally at the end is more implied than sharply crystallized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous ritual sequence from preparation through intervention to return to ordinary night. Causality is coherent—he comes to hush the code, deploys the wing, intervenes when a syllable rises, and the environment rebalances—under an accumulative/lyric lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is defused, the world subtly righted, and his ongoing vigilance hinted. The main weakness is that the world-door stakes remain largely conceptual, so the cost and danger never fully bite viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rooftop lesson → ritual with the seal → tutor’s history → narrator’s confession → final promise, all cohering around learning to “listen” to buildings. Causality is soft but legible: the meteor shower and seal ritual prompt the narrator’s realization and choice to commit. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the world reconfigures from “rumor” to “grammar,” with the cost being an ongoing responsibility to listen and host these “agreed upon lies.” The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, and no key setup is dropped, though the stakes remain more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative drive: tending the garden → confronting the shell → moving through the archive → making the door choice, each step tightening the ethical and emotional stakes. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode—Reina’s laugh animating vines and doors leads directly to the niche and the central question. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator redefines quarantine and self from keeper to threshold, with a clear before/after. Cost is legible in the surrender of prior control and identity, and no orientation debts or lens ambiguities undercut this.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single-ritual arc: preparation, activation of the key, incremental rewriting of the decrees, then the discovery of the hinge in the narrator’s own name and a final renunciation. Causality is coherent but the drive is primarily accumulative/textural, with each small act of inscription reweighting the central ethical stake until the closing choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: they partially free the guilds and consciously leave one hinge—self-directed power—untouched, with a felt cost. The only thing keeping it shy of 9+ is that the external consequences are mostly projected rather than pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: journey to canyon → descent via rumors and fissures → council revelation → use of the shell to free voices → reoriented life practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—understanding echoes as debt and commerce, then choosing to undo that system and teach “unborrowed note.” The cost is more conceptual than visceral (no visible sacrifice or immediate backlash beyond the council’s flight), but the before/after in her relationship to voice and power is legible. The accumulative/lyric pattern is taught early and maintained, with no orientation confusion or broken causality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear: dreams → wreck → shrine ritual → recovered name → vowed exposure, with each step causally or conceptually linked. Orientation (who/where/what) is anchored almost immediately, and the wreck/shrine backstory is woven without derailing the present scene. Closure is strong: the decisive change is her commitment to carry Leda’s name and expose the lie, reconfiguring her work from private salvage to public act, with a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than logistical, but it is legible in the charged final image of stepping into the night with only “borrowed starlight and a name.”

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged nets → accusation of thief → investigation via “moon paths” → discovery of Yazhen’s rescues → public revision of net-making practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: justice becomes a net that opens, with on-page cost in the implied loss of some catch and the elders’ “subtle ache.” The structure is linear and well-contained for the length, with one core throughline and no dangling setups. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with lyric accumulation, and that lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: arrival → encounter with Klay → exploration of stillpoint → discovery of letters → revelation about Stillwater → confrontation over the diamond → decision about what to write. The story lands a clear Conceptual Repricing: the “miracle” is redefined as engineered net, and journalism as an act that can alter the moral physics of the place without moving a stone. Stakes and cost are scaled well to the length, with the choice to omit names functioning as an Earned Stasis that preserves some myths while exposing the mechanism. Structure is linear, legible, and free of orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece functions as a mostly linear, accumulative rise-of-a-movement arc with a clear closure unit: the council blinks, the crowd’s “braid of choices” holds, and narrator/Kestrel settle into a new shared role and plan. Causal through-lines (broadcast → variant allegiance → council repression → Kestrel’s near-martyrdom → vault music → collective reconfiguration) are legible despite the lyric density. The closure has cost (Kestrel’s injury, cracked portico, the narrator’s chosen isolation) and a clear before/after in the city’s relationship to power. A small structural limitation is that key confrontations (council vs. crowd) are condensed rather than fully dramatized, keeping it just shy of top-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a tight accumulative arc: dawn → discovery of the music box → transmission to children → storm test → morning visitation and reconfigured vow. Causality is clear at each link (finding the box leads to the jar, to the children’s errand, to the widow’s healing, which reweights his vocation). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from eccentric collector to acknowledged bridge-builder, with the new jar “Kin” and his future-facing walk sealing the before/after. The piece stays in one coherent temporal window with a single POV and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene causal chain: guarding task → arrival of would-be buyer/thief → descent to vault → ritual use of the Lens → his change of heart and departure. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the external situation (artifact still safe) is similar, but relationships and self-knowledge have shifted with cost. Orientation and world rules are clear throughout despite the lyric mode. The only limiter is that the potential for catastrophic misuse is invoked more as a looming possibility than a live on-page near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: the dangerous viaduct and village reliance on speed → narrator’s proposal to use lunar quiet → council test → trial crossing → cultural shift. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the village adopts the new schedule, with a clear before/after in how they move and think. Stakes—losing tools, cargo, or lives to the viaduct; wasting precious frozen-lake time—are implicit but coherent, though the crossing itself could afford one sharper moment of on-page risk. Structure is essentially one continuous arc with reflection threaded in, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tight: entry into the tunnel → observation of physical evidence → inference of remote sealing and nepotistic contractor → rejection of the scripted narrative → whistleblowing. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric reportage in a single continuous scene) and sustains it cleanly; orientation is solid from the first few lines. Closure lands as a decisive change: she severs the director’s control channel, chooses allies, and commits to a report “without the erasures,” with her career and safety visibly at stake. The final image of the report moving like Underground Railroad signals functions as a conceptual repricing of her bureaucratic role, firmly delineating a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: need → shop → repair → ethical plan, with the parole hearing as an off-page but credible deadline. The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chaplain’s stance on “second chances” shifts from sermon to structured restitution. Every beat grows from the prior one without teleports or soft resets, and the ending reweights the earlier visit as the seed of an ongoing practice. The cost—time, emotional exposure to the victims’ side, and the risk of staking his authority on Hector—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine—arrow tip → decoding → journey → bell completion and ringing → new inward map—is clean and accumulative, and the closure (a reconfigured relationship to self/world/art) lands with cost. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, but each strange object or device has a clear “because/therefore” function, so nothing feels arbitrary. Stakes and options are legible at the end (she is now bound to an ongoing, risk-laden practice rather than a one-off feat). The only limitation is that complicating forces are light; almost nothing pushes back on her goal beyond ambient danger.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the recurring numbers → investigating → lying to gain access → descending to the Sargasso → decoding the patch → discovering the ledger → choosing not to leak it. The piece teaches its accumulative, archival pattern early and resolves under a hybrid lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis at the end. Closure lands on the page with cost in “I do the smallest impossible thing and let deletion be a home rather than a punishment,” which reweights everything we’ve seen. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity undermines the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: need for legible empathy → shard and mirrors → completed globe → envoys’ commitments → the narrator’s decision to accompany the teams. Closure is a decisive change plus charged poise: concrete mutual acts are promised and the narrator steps into the slush-bound role those acts require. Structure is linear with one purposeful digressive middle (the mirror lives) that returns to materially alter the climax. The only limit is that the meeting’s turn from accusation to cooperation feels slightly smooth, with minimal on-page resistance before convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: days at the marina under the enforced waiting period build toward a charged choice about whether to keep the euthanasia appointment. Causality is clean under a textural lens—volunteering leads to learning the “intonations,” to the ice crack and the boy’s near-accident, which directly deepens the narrator’s understanding and triggers the renewed postponement. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the narrator remains a euthanasia tourist but commits to another day of trawling, with the cost of continued existence palpable. A slightly sharper temporal hinge between “waking up changed” and arriving here could have strengthened structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: missed bus → encounter at the pavilion → deepening conversation → traveler’s phone call → parting, all causally linked. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative with causal beats, and closure lands clearly in the traveler’s decision to call and depart slightly reoriented while the sentinel reaffirms their role. The cost—risking a vulnerable call, relinquishing a certainty about mismatches—is understated but legible. There are no orientation issues, though the conflict window remains relatively low-key rather than sharply constrained by time or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → learning the pavilion/parapet → conjuring clearings → the echo’s appearance → boundary prayer and restated task, all cohering around the hinge between speech and shelter. Causality is more textural than event-driven but consistent: choices about how to tension the pavilion and define consecration enable the echo to arrive and land without harm. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules (echo, pavilion, parapet) are reweighted as a mutual naming between hinge and humans with a clear conceptual cost (perpetual, painful listening instead of ownership). Orientation (who/where/when) is legible early despite the lyric density, so there’s no structural debt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very clean: the installation builds from first arcs to a full “wing” that shelters the town, with each added memory tightening the emotional fabric. Causality is soft but coherent—each choice (spiral, asking for names, where photos are pinned) leads naturally to the next layer of collective stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “The masterpiece is not the pictures but the space we made to linger together inside them,” with the map case lighter and the town’s self-perception altered. Cost is felt as the labor of vulnerability and the relinquishing of purely private grief into a communal structure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build from solitary experiment → articulated method → public test at the Archive Court → reconfiguration of the library’s meaning. Each move arises logically from the last (his listening compels him to testify; the testimony’s effect compels him to restore the crystal). Closure is a conceptual repricing: the library is re-understood as “a garden of ears,” and the custodians’ slight internal shift gives this a felt cost in institutional terms. The single-scene continuity is clear, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very coherent: the drive to “capture the sound of growing older” threads the garden journey, the amphitheater, and the closing harbor image. Each move (markers, chalk commands, circle called Keep, the wave shifting arrows) builds toward a conceptual repricing of aging as “the sound of leaving without stopping anywhere at all.” Causality is internally solid—even in its lyric mode—without teleporting props or unkept setups. Closure lands cleanly with cost in the final recognition that the “home he could not remember yet” is bound up with both loss and the tape he’s made.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: malfunctioning clock → imminent comet pass and quakes → methodical repair using the leaf recording → successful capture of dust plumes → reflective closure. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, but the governor discovery and reseating provide a clear hinge that reorients both plot and theme. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the repaired timing system and new emotional stance reweighting everything that came before. A small limitation is that mechanical risk never feels close to genuine failure, so the external turn, while clear, is a bit understated in terms of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal spine is clean: blood work → rooftop request → call to Lena → shared song ritual → controlled ending. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, but each accumulation (mundane hymns, shard use, rooftop) has because/therefore linkage that narrows options and raises emotional cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ruth’s death, the sisters’ repaired bond, and the therapist’s understanding of “making endings precise,” all on the page. Nothing vital is left offstage or patched retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: observatory work → rumor → Archivist’s awakening → descent to the pods → construction of the model → conceptual revelation and stance shift. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a solid conceptual repricing: shadows redefined as returning teachers and fuel for the isle, with the protagonist choosing non-interference. Stakes tied to the isle’s altitude and the ethics of taking vs. witnessing are legible, but the cost of the final choice is more intellectual than dramatically pressured. Orientation (who/where/when) is stable despite the lyricism, and no significant setup is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: reed-substitute → suspicion → garden investigation → tooth-map-key → boy and fox → repair → apology with the tooth. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s stance toward myth and the father’s claims is materially changed, and the father’s grief is tangibly relieved. The river-found decoy and church-table bier echo powerfully at the end when they pass the reed body on the way home. Structure is linear with no orientation debt, and every major setup (substitute body, tooth, map, garden’s rules) is paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tending the lanterns → backstory of losing the sky → discovery of the pearl → ethical dilemma → integration of pearl and glass → reconfigured ongoing practice. The core turn is the appearance of the pearl, which reweights the entire vocation and produces a genuine choice with mutually costly outcomes. Closure lands in the final paragraphs as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator chooses a shared, braided hush over either extreme, and the status of their earthbound watching is quietly but decisively redefined. Causality in lyric mode is coherent; each step grows out of the established world logic and prior stance without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move through one continuous locus with time-ellipse, and the drive lens (transforming viral confession fallout into ongoing practice) holds. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: “If a camera comes again…” crystallizes a before/after stance with a visible cost (fear, refusal of spectacle) and an ongoing practice in its place. Causal threads—returning after the confession, following the icicle pattern, installing the pendant, agreeing to “maybe later” about public speech—are coherent and motivated. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but they do tighten meaningfully toward the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early—walking into the “whisper of closing pages,” then moving upriver through cameos to the source—and sustains it cleanly. Causality is coherent: each encounter (girl, fisherman, mentor) seeds an element that culminates in the ritual at the circle of books, where the narrator explicitly reconfigures their relationship to abandoned drafts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the drafts are solemnly acknowledged and their hopes released “upstream” to the reader, with a felt cost of grief and letting go. Structure is linear within its surreal frame; there are no orientation or lens-ambiguity debts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that moves from preparation to attempted remedy, snag, adjustment, and communal closure. Causality is legible within the piece’s mythic logic—Lio’s listening leads to the vine choice, the snag forces reorientation, the child’s observation enables the alignment, and the vow in “tree’s grammar” completes the remedy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant is renewed, the practice is entrusted to the community, and Lio relinquishes active control. The primary limitation is that the cost of failure or the personal risk to Lio and the village remains implied rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the stakes on the gentle side.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: arrive → prepare orchard/ritual → activate plate with starlight and pulses → print map → choose a direction and depart. The drive lens reads Hybrid, with a strong accumulative/ritual texture riding on a simple causal spine. Closure lands as a quiet but clear Decisive Change: she now has a map and commits to follow it toward Fen, with cost implied in the harsh environment and long search. Escalation is modest—no major reversal—but the ritual intensifies toward the plate’s activation and her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: broken timer → journey to cavern → echo-harvest experiment → reconstruction → departure with reconfigured time. Causality is clean enough within a lyric frame, and the closure—leaving with “winter-humility, measured by marble”—lands as a conceptual repricing of timekeeping. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, and there’s no orientation debt. Cost at the end is more implied than dramatized, which keeps this short of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, lyric pattern early and maintains it, with the core throughline of collecting/weighing burdens. Structure tightens when the valley personifies, poses an explicit dilemma, and the narrator reorients to the star, leading to a clear resonant reconfiguration (choosing enduring service within the “circle” of freedom). Causality is soft but coherent under the accumulative lens; each magical rule (lamp, shingles, beads) is applied consistently. The closure has cost and before/after legibility, though it stops just shy of a truly seismic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: one continuous scene bracketed by the kettle’s progress and the rain, with each action (carving, preparing tea, inserting the memento) flowing causally from the last. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has shaped grief into a portable ritual and accepts “here and gone” walking together. Cost is legible in her commitment to tending “the small animal of living” rather than mythologizing loss. There are no orientation issues or causality breaks; the only limitation is that the decisive change is quiet rather than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: Mara’s goal → use of the wheel → story fragments → ghost’s prohibition → demand for tribute → sacrifice → restart of the carousel. Causality is legible even within the lyric, time-sliding texture, and the orientation to who/where/what is solid despite the intentional chronological blur. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she restarts the carousel and loses a treasured self-image. The only slight limit is that the enormous external consequence (rains, settlement) is kept mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: arrival → discovery of tools/resources → design and re-routing → resurrection of the fountain → soft opening to the town. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the terminal shifts from dead infrastructure to a lightly reawakened commons, with on-page cost in Mara’s labor, constraint-calculations, and acceptance of limits. No orientation debt; POV, place, and situation are clear from the outset. The only brake on a higher score is that the stakes and costs, while coherent, stay modest and never truly corner her options.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment ritual with the bell is interwoven with concise backstory and moves toward a clear closure where her stance toward sound and silence reconfigures. Causality is quiet but legible—sanctuary rules → abandoned dream → smuggled bell → experiment with tremor → decision to bear rather than ring—under an accumulative/textural lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is established very early, and the single-scene frame never drifts. The cost—accepting a diminished “anthem” and living with a small, nontriumphant music—is on the page and conceptually convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is clean: investigation along the canal leads to physical evidence at the sluice, which enables the confrontation, siren blast, and public witnessing; each beat follows with a coherent “because/therefore” logic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the private architecture of lies is converted into shared, documentable truth (“paperwork crossed town like a weather front”) with real social consequences implied. The single-scene flow with one temporal window is legible throughout, and there is no orientation confusion. The only soft spot is a slightly convenient timing of the foreman’s arrival, though it doesn’t break plausibility or the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: listening → revelation of encoded knowledge → time pressure from the council → joint decision to translate and re-knot knowledge → planting the sprig and planning the council confrontation. Causality is coherent, with the council’s plan to tear down the dock sharpening the need to extract and transfer what the rope knows. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the knowledge has been partially saved, translated into new knots and seeds, with a clear before/after in their options. The actual council scene is off-page, which keeps this just shy of the most decisive causal closure tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clear and coherent: the narrator’s commission, Mira’s request, the first projection, the letter, and the planting all build toward a quiet but decisive reconfiguration. Causality in the lyric sense holds: each new obituary and encounter is a “therefore” that deepens the central project rather than a mere “and then.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: staying becomes a new mode of travel and absence is conceptually repriced into something “intimate with mercy.” No orientation debt; the frame (garden after evacuation) stays legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: discovery of the egg → decision to hide and nurture it → pressure from the Keepers → hatching and social reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s origin myth is reweighted through the hybrid hatchling and the recalibrated song. Cost is legible in the acknowledgment that beauty cannot “repair” their world and that both prince and bird embody compromise. The only slight softness is that the external institutional threat resolves quickly once the bird sings, keeping this just under exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative/textural, building ritual by ritual toward a quiet but definite reconfiguration: she leaves the coin and walks away in a new, earned relationship to her father’s legacy. Causality is clean in a lyric mode: coin → chosen trunk → grafts → boy’s arrival and soft transformation → final renunciation/continuation through leaving the coin. Orientation is solid from the first sentence; there’s no lens confusion. The only limit is that escalation remains modestly scaled and almost entirely internal, keeping this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: geese pause → fountains stop and memory fades → narrator follows glass “breadcrumbs” → finds and unsticks the panel through confession → opens box → memories return and time resumes. Closure is decisive and on-page: the city literally inhales, fountains begin to run, and the geese move, coupled with the narrator’s internal reconfiguration around her father. Cost is present in the demanded secret and in her choice to re-seal the emptied box, accepting an ongoing duty rather than a permanent fix. The piece reads as a tight hybrid of causal and lyric modes with no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → shared history → joint experiment → new orrery → vow and bequeathing of gears, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when inheritance is reframed (“transmission rather than repetition”) and embodied in leaving the gears for the next caretaker. Stakes and cost are conceptual but real: they risk altering a long-held, cautious tradition and acknowledge that even comfort can be perilous if unexamined. The pressure arc is gentle rather than sharply turning, but consistent with the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative and clean: repeated visits and braided ribbons build toward the question of how to complete a monument for endless losses. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: understanding the monument as a receiving space (hollows, loosened braid, communal supper) rather than a fixed shape. Causality is subtle but coherent—grandmother’s mentorship and townspeople’s offerings lead directly to the loosening choice and the stone’s final character. Stakes and costs remain largely internal and conceptual, which slightly mutes the sense of sharp before/after despite the clear pattern shift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: a single present-tense ascent and adjustment scene framed by one deep backstory shard about the father and handle, all causally tethered to the current ritual. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, but with clear causal beats: pause pendulum → consult handle → weigh pellets → make specific changes → recommit to an ethic. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration: he redefines how he’ll wield his power over time and guilt, with the cost of continuing to carry his own unlightened burden. Every setup (the handle, the ridge, the town’s “limping” hours) pays off in the closing promise and reset of the pendulum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: night work → ascent to silo → engagement with tapestry/case → chess reenactment → descent back to graves, with each step logically following the last. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: after decoding the tutor’s intention, Rowan alters the narrative by reenacting the endgame, letting the clock run out and easing the “uncharted echoes,” a clear before/after with emotional cost. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; nothing vital teleports or contradicts. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the external situation remains static, so structural stakes feel quiet rather than knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation in the spire, confrontation with the Council, demonstration of models, and a poised pre-writing ending. Causality is coherent—past oracle disaster → Council fear → narrator’s alternative framework—and the piece lands a clear Conceptual Repricing about prediction as trellis rather than wall. Closure is a Charged Poise moment before the first written word, with the cost framed as relinquishing comforting certainties and accepting ongoing uncertainty for the city. The stakes and constraint could be made slightly more concrete in the final beats, but the conceptual turn still lands strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is accumulative/textural, with each beat (receiving instructions, first dust-figure, neighbors gathering, patrol threat, violinist arrival) layering pressure and meaning. Causality is soft but legible: pirate broadcast → dust-technique → communal gatherings → heightened danger → solidified resistance, culminating in Mara’s decision to keep the dial uncloaked and tuned. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world has shifted from famine to a precarious but real return of narrative, with dust learning “the taste of words again.” A slightly clearer articulation of what could still go wrong (beyond generic patrol danger) would sharpen the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single ritual encounter that moves from intake to portrait to burning to aftermath. Causality is strong under an accumulative lens—each step (stories, drawing, refusal to let him keep it, burning, ash in mask) follows convincingly from the prior rules of the gallery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the drawing’s destruction and relocation into the broken mask recast what “keeping” and “safety” mean, with visible cost. There are no orientation or lens slips; the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is accumulative but clean: we move from world premise → discovery of the cog → pressure from factions → vault/ledger → strategic decision → teaching/chronometer working → communal repercussion. Causality holds under a textural/causal hybrid lens, and the closure (time restored, children learning, narrator’s path fixed) offers a clear before/after reconfiguration. Stakes are largely intellectual and societal rather than life-or-death, but they’re consistently tied to the chronometer and methods, so the arc feels coherent. The cost—remaining underground, outside institutional power—lands, though it’s more conceptual than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean single-session arc: gathering, teaching the method, a flare of interpersonal tension, a guided exercise, and a fragile new harmony that projects into the street. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, but causality is solid at key beats (Reza’s outburst → mutual confession of fear → rosette ritual → truer chord). Closure lands on the window-lit rosette and neighbors’ reactions, a Charged Poise that clearly marks a before/after in how these people relate to one another. Cost is legible in their choice to stay, speak, and sing through fear rather than retreat into familiar hatred.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: unlocking the greenhouse → preparing space → planting at alignment → seed’s awakening → resolved intention to spread this quiet resistance. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment and the traded-away memory provide concrete constraints and cost, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s possibilities feel different after the seed sprouts and responds. Stakes and causality are coherent; each step grows naturally from the last. The arc is more about deepening a stance than a sharp decisive turn, which suits the piece but slightly softens the sense of structural snap.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: blackout → drone failure → tower’s impending uselessness → riddle-guided discovery of the harp → bee-hum fix → reflective coda about firmware vs wonder. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world will publicly credit a firmware patch, but the keeper (and we) understand the deeper rule that “sometimes thunder needs a riddle.” The cost—living with a compulsion to truth and an under-credited, fragile craft of wonder-keeping—is legible in the ending stance. Structure is linear and contained, with no orientation issues or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → ritual of noticing and restoring objects → deepening communion with the house → quiet mutual agreement at the end. Causality under a textural lens is tight—each physical adjustment leads to subtler responses (drafts, photo falling, latch shifting) that build toward closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the mutual “agreement to keep each other company” and the settled shard of hush reweight the narrator’s work with cost in the form of an ongoing vow, though the stakes remain contemplative rather than sharply constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern early and follows it: each revelation (ampoule memory, scholar’s amphora, bishop’s consecration, inscription misreading) builds toward a reconfiguration of how the city understands certainty. Causality is associative but clear—ampoule → bishop → city-wide exhale → door → inscriptions → release—culminating in a conceptual and social change. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the city shifts from being held by certainty to being rebuilt through listening, with a legible before/after. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear despite the density of imagery, so there’s no structural debt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: dice → refusal → staircase penance → rupture of Tuesday → bargain → renewed ascent. The closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts the staircase as both prison and path while the stair stops and he continues, a felt cost locked in. Causality is mythic but legible within the conceit, and the dice choice cleanly seeds the entire ordeal. No orientation debt; the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—visitors arriving in sequence, each recognizing a fragment—builds a clear pattern toward the closing recommitment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she audits the “proofs,” draws the glyph “keep,” and chooses to continue her practice despite exhaustion and the city’s indifference. Causality is coherent and clean under a textural drive lens; no orientation or rule-breaking issues appear. The main limitation is that cost and risk stay low, so the final choice, while resonant, never feels pressured to a breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean accumulative-but-causal arc: beekeeper’s absence → scarcity and dread → second lens → discovery of the sluice → risky crossing → recovered trunk → reconfigured sense of the museum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role and the museum’s function are both reweighted with visible emotional cost (risking safety, abandoning “waiting”). The pressure of erasure vs remembrance stays coherent throughout, and the trunk discovery clearly answers the underlying drive without feeling mechanical. A slight softness is that the physical danger of the crossing remains mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the cost from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure follows a clean causal spine within an accumulative/lyric surface: yoyo clue → reverse-engineered mechanism → activation of inward beam → encounter with sister → acceptance of new, constrained role. The global drive coheres around the attempt to bend fate and the reconfiguration into “not rescue, but rendezvous,” which is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Closure is strong: the world has changed (ships redirected, wreck-sorrow loosened) and the protagonist’s options are permanently narrowed (feeding the hunger stone nightly, keeping clocks reversed). If anything, the actual mechanics of “exit its grammar” versus “cannot rewrite the storm” are slightly abstract, but they don’t undercut legibility of before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: return to the funhouse → setup of the curse and clasp → entering the maze → confession and baiting → trapping fear in the photo → release and exit. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: fear is emptied and unraveled, the advisor is unmasked as fear’s trick, and the narrator leaves with altered stance. Stakes and price are legible in the final choice to open the door and let the luminance go, accepting ordinary weather instead of haunted containment. The temporal framing “after the resuscitation” is consistently threaded and never confuses orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a looming swell threatens the orchard, he designs and executes a sonic strategy, and the wave is reconfigured rather than simply vanquished. Causality is coherent at every step, with his diagram, bottle placement, and timed strikes flowing logically into the outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sea is given “a door,” the storm becomes interlocutor instead of enemy, and his ongoing watch carries cost and continuity. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but the causal throughline remains legible and satisfying without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rusted gate → decision to open → journey across the turtle → inquiry to the watchers → conceptual answer that reconfigures the city’s situation. Causality within the dream-logic holds: the whistle motivates the turtles; that movement enables contact; that contact yields the truth about the expedition and shifts the city’s paths. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“We are not safe, but we are oriented”) with an intelligible before/after and a conceptual cost. The main limitation, at an elite standard, is that the obtaining of the answer feels almost too unresisted; the path from question to revelation is a bit friction-light.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara arrives with a purpose, uses the letter to locate the pit, retrieves the ledgers, and the town then must decide what to do with the uncovered truth. The descent into the shaft and the revelation that there was no fire but a hidden detour function as the pivotal structural turn. Closure is solidly on-page as they decide to publish a “calendar of what happened, not a call to vengeance,” a resonant reconfiguration that clearly reweights the town’s story. The main limitation is a relative lack of obstacles—the investigation succeeds almost too smoothly, which keeps escalation from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival after the bridge lifts, clandestine note-placing, discovery of S.G., and the final acceptance of a lineage of watchfulness. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—the tide window, the masons’ work, and the found cavity all motivate successive actions. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from mere surveyor to a self-effacing node in the city’s memory, with the implied cost of eroding his own singularity. Stakes and change are scaled appropriately to the lyric scope and clearly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: blackout → methodical testing of the stamp → pattern discovery → personal link to the harbor judge → decision to mark the ledgers and leave a chalk arrow. Causality is clean under a textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library’s function and the narrator’s task are reweighted from mere cataloging to active reclamation. The cost is conceptual (opposing the new shoreline’s false authority, accepting slow, dangerous work under water) rather than dramatized as immediate peril. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the opening, so there’s no structural or lens ambiguity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: daily work → Lio’s fall and lost shadow → developing dream-lantern practice → thousand-crane lift ritual → shadow’s return and stance shift. Causality is lyrical but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each motif (tea, gems, basilica, cranes) recurs with added pressure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the shadow returns not with Lio but with balance, and the narrator chooses an ongoing, altered way of living with grief. Plot is intentionally slim and interior, so readers wanting a sharper external turn might feel a slight softness in overt eventfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from setup (cooling observatory, hunt resuming) to discovery of the unused-potential pool at the massacre site to the ethical decision not to mine it. Causality holds under the lyric mode—the instrument work leads to the spectral valley, which links to her past, which forces the moral choice to publish coordinates and lock access. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they forego the extraction path with on-page cost (institutional anger, lost “miracle”) and a reweighted sky image. All stakes and world rules relevant to this decision are in place before the turn, with no retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → ritual setup → experiment → interpretive turn → decision to depart, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: belonging redefined as pauses/margins, which in turn produces a concrete plan (“depart before dawn…where the blanks point”). The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds from drones and starlight patterns through to the map of rests. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the implied risk of following absence rather than marked routes is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: the mailed watch hand prompts a return to the shore, which leads to the driftwood plank, the hidden hair/note, and the revelation of his own bartered provenance. This yields a genuine closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing) when he realizes he was “ghostwriter of [his] own absence” and chooses to speak rather than conceal. The structure (terrace frame → shore investigation → terrace return) is tight and legible without orientation issues. A minor limitation is that all external conflict remains offstage, so structural stakes lean heavily on interior realization rather than tangible interruption or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored slips into backstory that all inform present tactics. Causality is clear—ritual, apologies, Daro’s refusal, rephrased apologies, crossings—within a situational frame where the ritual itself is the plot. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the negotiator recommits to stewarding the “country” between apology and forgiveness at a real emotional cost. The only limiter is that the external risk of failure or breakdown in the exchange stays somewhat abstract rather than materially tightening late.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine—launch → paddle under mounting reflection → confession → altered return—is clean, with every reflective shard anchored to present sensory cues and feeding the decision at the channel. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he remains a “broken navigator” but now walks home with a reweighted compass/star ethic and a shifted burden of regret. Stakes (whether he will actually show up and speak the “pure” version) are established early and answered explicitly on the page. No orientation or lens ambiguity: the hybrid causal/accumulative pattern is taught from the first paragraph and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clear: procedure → journey to the lake → confession/payment → charge with empathy → return to the city to seed the fountains. The “payment is confession” beat is a strong structural hinge, and the baseball’s guidance through the tunnels and toward “passages of less regret” maintains coherent drive. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: he cannot erase his past, but he chooses an incremental, costly repair in the public fountain, with ribs “practicing their hinges.” The structure is linear with accumulative lyric texture rather than twisty, but never feels outline-like or arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a single ritual scene with interleaved backstory that consistently points toward the conjuration and metamorphosis, so causality holds cleanly under a primarily accumulative drive. Each step—spices, beasts, story, fortune—builds toward the arrival of the ember-shape and the mutual bird-form, with no orientation confusion. Closure is a Decisive Change: the narrator completes metamorphosis and the bond is reconfigured in a new form, with the cost of her purely human life on the page. The pattern taught early (lyric ritual) is the one that resolves the story, keeping the lens stable.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: climb → ritual → vision/path → retrieval of minutes → return and re-inscription with the baby, all driven by the same goal. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to time and motherhood is repriced, with explicit cost (promised sacrifices of minutes, the “weight of my gratitude nearly breaks me”). The world’s rules are stable within its magic-lyric frame, and each escalation (cards, saucer, clouds, chimes) follows from the last. Nothing important is left dangling, and the before/after is legible without feeling mechanically tied up.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story’s causal skeleton is clean: learn the coordinates via tear/photographs, navigate the ship to the lock, refuse the warhead, open the door by stitching, and step through with the child into a new “roomness” while striking a vow. The accumulative lyricism never obscures who/where/when, and the global drive (to open the dimension nonviolently) holds steady to the final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ship and narrator move from scavenged exile to being “quilted” into a gentler home, with the price of ongoing emotional labor explicitly acknowledged (“so long as we kept doing the work”). There are no serious orientation or lens slips, though external stakes stay more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the detour → rumor about tides → encounter with the boy → use of pre-placed tools and neighbors → revealed shoal path → cave rescue. The piece infers a Hybrid (causal + textural) lens but resolves under a causal drive, with the rescue and Mara’s afterward choices (giving her last coins, letting coincidences vanish) providing on-page closure and cost. No orientation debt: time, place, and stakes are legible early and stay coherent despite lyric density. The only slight limitation is that danger feels largely controlled and never truly threatens to derail the rescue, keeping escalation strong but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → sundial code → secret door → cradle of sparks → repaired wheel → restored and redefined light, with the narrator’s choices driving each step. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s relationship to light and authority is conceptually repriced, and the final hinge image clarifies the before/after. Cost is present but understated (treason risk, sacrifice of the quill holder) and never sharply tested by on-page resistance, which keeps the structural tension from reaching the very top tier. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear despite the lyric density, and the pattern remains coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear and coherent: world-rule → method with rocks/eels/dust → repeated attempts → climactic night where the method is intensified and tested with her present. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: for a “borrowed dawn” the shore holds, the bowl can be released, and the promise attains provisional fulfillment with visible cost (it may not last; he remains cursed and bound). Causality within the invented physics (patterns focus dust, promises bind it) is consistent and paid off cleanly. The only ceiling is that escalation and cost are more lyrical than sharply bordered, which keeps this just shy of exceptional under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: summons → ascent → vigil → encounter with Mara → shared history of the timer → decision to read and timed recitation. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, with each beat reweighting the central stakes of voice versus erasure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the censored poem is finally spoken, explicitly “crossing out the crossings-out,” and the silence after is charged rather than empty. The cost (risk, exposure, the finality of speaking the forbidden text) is felt even if external consequences remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: decoding the overture → arrival of the “courier” → duel as test of intent → mutual trust and joint plan to reach the council, with each beat following logically. The drive lens is primarily causal with lyric accumulation, and the closure lands as a decisive change: they shift from opposed roles to a compact to deliver the overture on their own terms. Cost is present but mostly conceptual and anticipatory (risking the mission by trusting him; risking defiance of the council), not concretely dramatized in fallout. Structure stays within one continuous window and is easy to follow despite the density of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural drive: night-long rebuilding coalesces into a re-opened, redefined library with social implications. Causality is clean—prying bars, planting seeds, neighbors joining, then the sign and purchase of nails—and the final image (“our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library”) delivers a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (open defiance of developers, a reclaimed commons). Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored immediately and never lost despite the lyric style. The only limit keeping this from 9+ is that the cost of defying the city’s threats is more implied than directly pressured or tested in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: station grief → arrival of reel → ascent to the arbor → musical summoning of the corridor → reunion and partial repair. “Hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel” provide a clear magical mechanism that’s set up and then paid off in the return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara is restored and time slightly retuned, with the four heartbeats of the clock as a tangible cost, though the hinted “price the corridor had demanded” remains teasingly off-page rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: dreams → seed awakening → planting at the right locus → reef treaty → monsoon closure, all under the drive of preserving memory. Causality holds in a lyric way, and the monsoon deadline plus missing reef treaty provide a late tightening that justifies the “accelerate the rite” move. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the sapling, selective remembering, and agreed washing by the monsoon clearly mark a before/after with conceptual cost. The piece remains slightly more ceremonial than pressured, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: arrival on the islet → ritual preparation using lace/compass → tidal pool revelation → internal reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens: each concrete act (indigo, pruning restraint, opening the compass) begets the next density increase and vision. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the quest to locate an external color yields an internal harbor of forgiveness, with cost in the faced regret. No orientation issues: who/where/when and the “severance” frame are clear early and pay off in the visions of the classroom and rescue boat.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from assessment to triage to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. The decision to write a report based on "gradual change" rather than heroic vows acts as the pivot, and the ending image of the dust maps recontextualizes the damage into a tool for navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causality is driven by poetic association (frost patterns matching a ledger) rather than organic logic, which strains credibility even in a lyrical mode. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost is largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is elegant, moving from the establishment of the method to a personal complication (the fisherman) and finally a civic test (the bell). The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration; unable to restore sound, the protagonist reconfigures the meaning of the bell’s voice through heat, satisfying the "rectify" stake with conceptual precision. Orientation is immediate and the logic of the silent world holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain from the package's arrival to the library descent is tight and imaginative. However, the resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina ("the old undertaker's trick of occupying impossible spaces") that is introduced only at the moment it is needed to solve the central physical problem, bypassing the established constraints without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, moving from a communal ritual to a specific challenge and return. The closure (breathing on the bell, Earned Stasis) is resonant, though the "I" narrator appearing briefly in a "We" story creates a minor perspective glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ritualistic structure provides a clear beginning, middle, and end, fitting the "Accumulative" drive lens. However, the progression is linear and smooth; obstacles are nonexistent, reducing the narrative to a procedural description of a magic trick. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing ("storehouse is breath"), but the lack of prior complication weakens its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The surreal causality is consistent, and the transition from the "retrocognitive trap" to freedom follows a clear logic. The resolution—simply asking the shard to leave—is slightly low-friction, though the resulting Conceptual Repricing (trading photos for internal knowing) provides valid, paid-for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the standoff shifts from arrest to apprenticeship ("we climb together") with established causal logic. The narrative drive is tight, moving efficiently from the piano puzzle to the arrival of the Collectors without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, gathering "absences" to tune the device for a decisive final test. Closure is resonant and earned; the device's verdict of "kindness" rather than alarm reconfigures the relationship with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    Causality relies on "dream logic" and convenient backstory rather than active choice. The pivotal decision to stay is driven by a "legend" about a surgery—information that arrives ex machina via the thief's presence rather than being earned by the protagonist. The link between missing the train and the mother's survival is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story functions as a vignette under an Accumulative lens but fails to escalate pressure or achieve a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. The ending affirms the status quo established in the first paragraph; the "generator cough" is a potential disruption instantly resolved by singing, rendering the closure low-stakes and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands with a clear turning point, but the inciting causal chain relies on dream logic that breaks the thriller frame. Finding a specific cast in a bin that decrypts via a seashell to a specific library book is a contrivance that undermines the plot's solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear arc of "Conceptual Repricing," where the threat of endless night is recontextualized from a trap to a passage ("through being longer than out"). The orientation is immediate, and the closure lands effectively on a philosophical level. The drive lens functions well as an accumulative instruction that pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story utilizes the loop structure not just as a premise but as an accumulative engine, gathering weight (chalk marks, chest dots) that pays off in a strong Conceptual Repricing closure. The melting of the violin provides a tangible, irreversible state change that anchors the thematic realization. The narrative arc moves cleanly from assignment to investigation to a "hacked" equilibrium with the system.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a static situation to a specific action (projecting the lens) and resolution. However, the inciting pressure ("season of doctored memories") is backstory-heavy, and the climax—Rell's immediate, silent surrender—lacks sufficient friction to feel fully earned. The closure is legible (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the obstacle melts away too easily to generate high dramatic voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly focused on the confrontation with the Auditor, moving efficiently from method to proof. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the garden physically validates the gardener’s labor, satisfying the central drive. The pacing allows the philosophical weight of the "cracked proofs" to land without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of competence: setup, execution, and success, with no meaningful setbacks or deviations. While the closure (proof of the theory) is legible, the absence of a "felt cost" or significant obstacle makes the arc feel like a vignette rather than a fully dramatized story with high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Situational/Causal hybrid lens where the ghost's warning forces a decisive action with immediate, visible consequences (the collapse). Closure is impactful, resolving the physical threat while leaving a resonant conceptual cost in the collective denial ("pretend nothing spoke to us").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is flawless; the backstory of the "smudge" integrates perfectly with the present urgency of the convoy. The closure is a decisive, active warning that carries clear professional and emotional stakes, satisfying the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the drive is clear, the resolution relies on a "talking prop"—a ledger with "hush paid" explicitly written in it. This convenience resolves the central mystery through exposition rather than inference or ambiguity, reducing the narrative tension too easily at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery and the arrival of refugees. Closure is achieved via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the keeper chooses patience over escape. The pacing is deliberate, though the link between the refugees and the final crack feels sequential rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, utilizing the eclipse as an effective pacing device for the session. However, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by a decisive causal turn; the breakthrough arrives via ritual alignment rather than a choice with significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure works well, building sensory pressure toward a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration where the historian's act of writing relieves the walls. The closure is quiet but earned, though the narrative arc relies more on observation than causal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central mechanism—pinpricks on a window projecting legible sentences across a harbor—strains physical credibility (optics) without sufficiently establishing a magic-realism frame. The narrative arc is linear and frictionless, leading to a "warm bath" closure where potential conflict dissolves into immediate agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Situational arc where density builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure (the entity recognizing its hunger as a door) is a high-concept conceptual repricing that feels earned by the established rhetorical magic system. The ending lands with a "truer" silence, validating the loop structure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative structure is flawlessly executed; the vertical ascent provides a natural gradient for the deepening sensory pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist surrenders control to the art they have summoned, with the physical cost of the cold clearly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story executes a coherent situational arc where dream logic successfully builds to a legible closure (Earned Stasis). While the "procedural" mechanism relies on told instructions ("The tablet said...") rather than organic dramatization, the final beat lands with clear conceptual and physical cost. The pacing is steady, though the resolution with the guard feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting need to a ritualistic transformation and a confirmatory final scene. The drive lens shifts from accumulative pressure in the cavern to a causal outcome in the classroom. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the drum bridges her internal change to her external practice, though the ending scene feels slightly like an epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situational arc, moving from observation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where a plan is formed. While the closure lands with a clear shift in tactics, the "cost" (comfort/safety) is stated in reflection rather than dramatized as a painful trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change where the narrator abandons caution for necessary pain. The causal chain is tight, linking the mechanical opening of the flower directly to the emotional opening of the vial, with the cost of grief clearly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the mural and rope physically altered to resolve the time loop. While the resolution works within fable logic, the acceptance of the "poem" trade bypasses the established sacrifice (the map), slightly softening the causal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from solitude to community ritual. However, the causality relies on fable-logic convenience—specifically the "map drawn on a napkin" appearing in the bowl without clear provenance—which bypasses the need for the protagonist to solve the location problem herself. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (hush learns to listen), which is valid.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a clear inciting need to a resonant closure where the transaction alters the client while leaving the dealer in a costly stasis. The concept of the "bridge" provides a satisfying, tangible resolution to the abstract problem of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure hinges on a massive, unearned coincidence (the uncle/tuner connection) that resolves the backstory mystery instantly. The present-time plot is static—a ceremonial gathering where plans work perfectly without causal pressure or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, unobstructed path: arrive, search, find, weave, belong. The "search" for the tag lacks complication or false leads, resulting in a progression that feels inevitable rather than earned. Closure works as a resonant image but lacks the weight of a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from the inciting climb through the mechanical ritual to a resonant closure. The ending functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the watcher’s intervention reframes the narrator’s "transgression" as a necessary part of the giant’s ecological rhythm. Causality is tight, with the magic system’s rules clearly dictating the pacing and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, building density through the ritual until the apparition provides a Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is driven by the logic of the magic system, which holds together well, though the progression is somewhat linear and low-resistance. The closure—accepting uncertainty as a partner—lands with a valid conceptual cost, effectively reweighting the protagonist's approach to grief.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight and unbroken; the outage prompts the work, the work prompts the trap, and the trap forces the encounter. Closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to the setting and Mara is irreversibly altered, satisfying the prompt's high-band requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a poetic assertion that defies physical plausibility: moss "stitching" wood to hold a trellis together against a gale is structurally unsound in a realist frame. This resolves the physical stakes through lyrical metaphor rather than causal logic, weakening the closure's verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is solid, moving logically from the brooch discovery to the mural's execution with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. While the discovery of the map in the cistern feels somewhat convenient, the structure supports the thematic outcome without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is executed with precision, braiding the pilgrim, the pearl, and the shadow into a coherent ritual closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow finds a home; however, the lack of significant resistance or cost keeps the narrative tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting object (the valve) to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. While the linear progression lacks a complication or "micro turn" to heighten tension before the climax, the ending effectively recontextualizes the city's silence as permission.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic progression from the street to the fortress, holding the Accumulative lens well. The closure lands a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (truths as travelers) that retroactively justifies the journey, though the transition through the gate feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc where the ritual acts as a crucible for the characters' hidden grief. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the tower is physically and emotionally transformed by the shared confession, earning the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight; the narrator's trap relies on established rules (magnetism, the fragment's hunger) that pay off in the climax. Closure is decisive and resonant, effectively utilizing the "twin metal" setup to facilitate the curse transfer and the narrator's exit.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causality is masterful; every prop (ink pot, certificates) and established constraint (the "timed procession") pays off in the confrontation. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing ("breath for truth"), where the trade is balanced on the page. The pacing of the "active waiting" builds tension that releases cleanly in the alley.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is a lyrical vignette (Accumulative lens) rather than a narrative with causal progression. While the ending offers a form of Earned Stasis, the "power falters" beat resolves too easily via "sap fragrance," lacking the requisite on-page cost to make the persistence feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mosaic structure works well to establish the accumulated weight of the protagonist's existence before narrowing into the specific incident with the poison label. The encounter with the clerk provides a clear causal pivot, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist creates a shared method of "hearing" with the woman—lands effectively. The looseness of the timeline fits the accumulative drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, gathering sensory details until the "compass" forces a directional shift inward. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's apology alters the "riddle." The logic of the magic system (sound decoding memory) is consistent and pays off the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality relies on "dream logic" where a stone chip fits into a painted mural socket to mechanically reveal arrows, which clashes with the otherwise grounded socio-economic conflict. The resolution is unearned; the financiers abandoning a multimillion-dollar acquisition simply because one pier is quiet for an afternoon lacks credible narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The countdown structure provided by the sunrise and the chemical timer creates effective situational pressure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sky is lost but the memory is secured—lands well. The synchronization of the chemical message with the sunrise is slightly convenient but narratively earned by the mentor's established skill.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    The arc is a linear procedural (fix, search, retrieve) that restores the status quo without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, and the logic of a blind character "examining" light refraction creates a causality bump that is not fully smoothed by the translation-to-sound explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is a clean, ritualistic procedural that moves efficiently from divination to discovery and return. Closure lands as a successful moment of Charged Poise, where the discovery is secured but the looming conflict with the world is acknowledged. The orientation is solid, and the magical logic of the steam-map is taught early and paid off clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot is a linear ritual rather than a causal story; the central problem (ruin) is solved by magic without genuine setbacks or failure states. Closure feels inevitable and unearned, resting on a "just so" progression of events.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is exemplary; the story executes a Conceptual Repricing where the "distress signal" is transformed from a plea into a gift, with the tangible cost of the narrator's remaining air. The causal chain, while relying on lyrical logic ("perfume translated to frequency"), remains internally consistent and emotionally potent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the method from panic to patient marking with clear conceptual cost. The dream logic holds together firmly under the Accumulative/Textural lens, earning the final insight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator's relationship to the orchard shifts from technical tuning to relational atonement with a clear conceptual cost (endless payment). The "backstory download" via the bead is a slightly convenient mechanism, but the logic of the "ledger" holds the ending together well.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear ritualistic logic (Accumulative/Textural lens) that leads to a successful Conceptual Repricing of the lighthouse at closure. While the obstacles yield too easily to the narrator's competence—reducing tension—the final image of the blind book and the town is resonant and earned by the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on montage and summary (&quot;Our days unfolded,&quot; &quot;I began to search&quot;) rather than a specific, pressure-filled scene. The resolution—finding the shards and fixing the dial—feels inevitable and frictionless, lacking the causal turns or earned cost required for strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the request to the encoded solution, supported by the specific logic of the setting. The closure—a decision to pause and "not yet mail"—operates as a Charged Poise, reweighting the moment from action to deeper preparation. However, the causal link for the final hesitation is slightly obscure; the protagonist scripts a pseudonym, fixes the code, yet stops, implying the name written wasn't "right" despite the earlier purposeful action. This slight friction in the final beat keeps the grade from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story teaches its mechanics of sympathetic magic early, ensuring the climax—where stitching alters the bells and gate—lands as a decisive, earned causal turn. The closure is distinct, marking a shift from perfect order to "frayed" mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is exemplary; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the past moment lands with distinct emotional cost. The logic of the transition between the mangrove reality and the hospital memory is seamless, and the final choice to leave the letter feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    The linear arc is tightly constructed, moving from the initial problem to a decisive resolution earned via the protagonist's specific skills. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the conflict, sealed effectively by the graft metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds the "daydream" logic, and the closure—leaving the fragment and recipe—lands a solid Conceptual Repricing. The logic of the "knowledge network" holds within the established magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is a clean process/discovery loop, effectively paced as a lyrical vignette. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—the narrator realizes their place in the lineage—but the discovery of the hidden diagram feels like a reward for competence rather than a hard-won consequence of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a coherent fable logic with a clear inciting incident and conceptual climax. The resolution—where the collectors retreat because they "realized the math"—works well within the established surreal tone, though it relies on the antagonists conveniently accepting the protagonist's poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from a jarring unmotivated tense shift, opening in the past ("woke me") and switching to the present ("I ensconce") halfway through. The resolution is linear and lacks causal friction; the long-standing war dissolves instantly upon the performance of the ritual without complication or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc where the disruption (the drone) leads to a specific investigation and a resonant reconfiguration of the library. The closure is earned; the physical rearrangement of the shelves signifies a tangible shift in her mission, carrying the weight of exhaustion and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent but lacks a tightening phase; the "sealed room" and the "dreaded knot" yield immediately to the characters' first attempts. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure relies on a "magic bullet" solution (the glue pattern) that resolves a complex resource conflict with symmetric satisfaction, satisfying all parties without a felt trade-off or cost. The plot arc is linear and convenient, bypassing the need for a hard decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causal chain—request, risk assessment, action, consequence—holds firmly under a Causal lens. The closure, with Thimble returning a tangible reply, successfully validates the risk taken. The storm functions as a complication, though it is endured rather than navigated with agency, which slightly softens the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative traces a clear Accumulative arc, gathering clues (codes, grain, memories) to build a Resonant Reconfiguration of the father's absence. The closure—leaving the frame open—lands with conceptual weight, recontextualizing the "necessary distances" from a source of pain to a sacred meeting place.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the central crisis (generator hesitation) is resolved instantly by a symbolic gesture without mechanical causality or effort. While the ending achieves a form of Earned Stasis ("I stayed"), the lack of prior obstacle or tangible cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The plot logic relies on dream-like association, bypassing the "because/therefore" rigor required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is linear and low-resistance; the resolution relies on a convenient agreement with the bird rather than a structurally earned turn with visible cost. While the closure lands conceptually, the path there feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is elegant, utilizing a clear Situational drive lens where the "game" serves as the organizing principle. Closure is distinct and resonant: the exchange of the bishop and the erasure of the grid by the tide create a "Resonant Reconfiguration" with a felt conceptual cost (the transience of the constructed order). Causality is linear and precise, fitting the protagonist's intent, though the lack of significant obstacles makes the progression feel somewhat safe.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a state of hidden practice to a shared act of rebellion. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration of the relationship and status—lands effectively. However, the mechanism of the turn relies heavily on the "magic" of the dance rather than a causal interplay of hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on a contrivance where a beam of light conveniently underlines a specific ledger entry to resolve a bureaucratic conflict. This "magical fix" breaks narrative causality; the outcome is unearned by the protagonist's agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a burden carried to a burden shared and reframed (Conceptual Repricing). The inciting incident (the fire choice) is strong but retrospective; the present-action scene lacks immediate causal pressure, unfolding as a frictionless exchange of wisdom. Closure is legible and earned, effectively reconfiguring the protagonist's future role.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("By the third night," "When the season turned") rather than a dramatized scene, violating scope defaults and dissipating tension. The accumulation of neighbors feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle or causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exploration to discovery to intervention with clear causality established by the diary entries. The resolution—altering the echo—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the ease of the "humming" fix slightly lowers the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, effectively utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the city's perception is permanently altered. The causal chain from the painter's arrival to the collective epiphany is logical and earned within the fable's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, hybrid causal-ritual logic where each step of the ceremony raises the pressure until the blockage (the specific blood debt) requires a new, higher cost. The closure—a vow of silence functioning as a "hinge" for peace—is a potent Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing that resolves the arc with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tight, governed by the environmental constraints of the "manufactured drought" and the acoustic timing of the thunder. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "narrower grace" is a distinct, costly outcome that reweights the stakes (survival vs. redemption) without providing a tidy solution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is distinct and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending (the city "resung") lands effectively. The "story logic" of the lock—untangling metaphors to open a door—works well for the genre, though the cost paid ("burned softly") is more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal arc from realization to experimental performance is solid, and the closure effectively reconfigures the setting. The transition to the bar is handled efficiently within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc: preparation, ritual construction, arrival, and dismantling. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the dismantling of the structure), which perfectly suits the theme of transience and lands with earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is a clean, linear ritual enactment that leads to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (deciding to stay). While functionally sound, the plot lacks a moment of doubt or failure; the "risk" mentioned regarding the last braid resolves instantly, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear fable logic with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure (the directive becomes an invitation). However, the causality is soft; the resolution relies on a shift in perspective rather than a hard-won consequence or trade-off. The introduction of "mercy" in the final paragraph feels structurally unearned, as it doesn't stem from the prior "rust and rain" motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is precise; the ritual's steps logically drive the narrative to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist reaffirms his duty. The conceptual cost ("diminished into a method") is legible and thematically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fable-like structure works well for the length, with a clear beginning, middle, and resonant end. However, the causal link at closure—where Mara’s personal release immediately causes the external war to "turn home"—strains credibility even within the genre; the macro-resolution feels unearned by the micro-action. The pacing is steady, though the dialogue carries a heavy burden of exposition regarding the "cellular memory" mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story operates on a coherent dream-logic where ritual leads to result, and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of the orchard) is distinct. The causality, however, feels soft; the resolution relies on a sudden conceptual shift that meets little narrative resistance, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing of what it means to mend and promise, anchored by the physical repair of the pipe. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistent, using the repair process to deepen the thematic argument. The inciting breach and the closing "handshake" frame the narrative cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "third road" resolves the linear debt crisis with a conceptual cost (the loss of the self-portrait). The logic follows a consistent dream-like causality, anchored effectively by the bathroom interludes which provide necessary pacing breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a closure that lands with a tangible conceptual cost (the right to forget). The resolution of the traveler's trap relies on symbolic dream-logic ("writing the apology makes the wall shiver"), which fits the genre but feels slightly convenient compared to the rigorous setup of the contract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear, dream-logic trajectory from entry to release, utilizing the established magic system well. The climax relies on summarizing the "worst part" of the memory rather than dramatizing the content, which softens the felt cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from discovery to resolution, but the trajectory is linear and low-stakes. The resolution functions as a "soft reset" where the problem is fixed through a convenient correspondence (seal matches rope) without forcing a difficult trade-off. Closure is legible but lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative flows linearly from investigation to resolution without a significant setback, making the "pact with danger" feel theoretical rather than demonstrated. The closure—a cooperative "tuning"—is conceptually satisfying (Resonant Reconfiguration) but lacks a distinct moment where the outcome was in doubt or options were forcefully narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational arc where the protagonist's preparation meets a thematic resolution. The micro-failure of the beam ("snagged on years") creates necessary friction, and the closure—a connection that validates her worldview—lands with both emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a pleasing ritual shape, but the central pivot—testing a conjecture—lacks causal friction; the test succeeds immediately without complication. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "magic solved it" logic feels slightly convenient for a story about difficult identity work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a sound linear structure with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure (silence recontextualized as courage). However, the "mosaic" functions as a convenient script that removes tactical friction and agency from the middle build.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, successfully shifting the goal from a decision (stay/leave) to a shared endurance of uncertainty. The structure is tight, with the "tangential approach" motivating the pacing, though the middle relies slightly on static observation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, escalating through three distinct "pours" of silence that function as beats of increasing pressure. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing where the "bunker note" and "gilded hush" are alloyed, effectively resolving the internal conflict with a lasting change in stance toward the past.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective arc from the disruption of the bell to the restoration of harmony. The closure is resonant, utilizing the "storm glass" and the mother's relief to signal a successful reconfiguration of the emotional stakes. The opening orientation is slightly repetitive, but the structural integrity of the scene remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear trajectory from the inciting assignment to the resonant closure of stewardship. The pacing is steady, and the transition from the orchard to the ascent is managed well. The resolution lands firmly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the progression feels slightly frictionless, with tools and environments yielding readily to the protagonist's expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration where the emptiness gains a pulse) lands with coherence. However, the progression is linear and lacks causality-driven complications; the ritual succeeds simply because the narrator initiates it, resulting in a low-friction plot that feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent surreal logic where "concepts become physical," allowing the closure (creating a diamond bead through kindness) to land effectively as a Conceptual Repricing. The pacing is steady, though the conflict resolution relies on this pre-established magical rule rather than a causal turning point. The ending provides a clear sense of change and cost (the effort of "tightening truth").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean, utilizing the acoustic mechanism to drive the reveal logically. The structure creates a complete loop from the inciting entry to the closing realization, though the linearity offers few surprises beyond the nature of the lock itself.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the environment solves the protagonist's problems (the program "falls free," the map "directs" him). The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "cost" (shedding burdensome armor) feels like a relief rather than a price paid, reducing the narrative tension to a guided tour of a magical space.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the archive’s purpose, shifting from static storage to active care with a felt cost in the breach of protocol. The narrative drive is clean, moving logically from the forensic reading of the dust to the decisive act of mailing the button.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on "magical" convenience rather than hard causality; the "puddle map" is poetic but logically opaque, and the climax dissolves the threat via the sudden arrival of neighbors who "break the squads with witness." In a regime that erases whole towns, the idea that mere witnessing stops the squads feels naive and unearned, undercutting the narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive, where a ritualistic confrontation is established and resolved with distinct causality. The use of "negative space" and the prism to defeat the code creates a logical, if magical, cause-and-effect sequence. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, leaving the world safe but the protagonist burdened, fulfilling the story’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structurally sound with a clear Causal drive; the inciting object directly enables the climax. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (releasing the seeds) that logically results in the arbor rising, satisfying the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and the fable-like structure supports the journey well. Closure is strong, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's business model reflects the internal shift, effectively recontextualizing the "broken" clocks as a feature of the new worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story achieves strong closure via Conceptual Repricing: redemption is redefined not as a miracle but as the delivery of a hard truth, with the father's hatred as the accepted cost. The accumulative lens holds well as the physical repair mirrors the internal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is seamless, moving from the setup of the gorge to the specific challenge of the laugh, culminating in a high-cost emotional exchange. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), with the "laugh" becoming a companion, perfectly balancing the earlier loss.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a coherent "ultraviolet penance" logic where internal states manifest as external geography. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the conceptual cost of leaving the "tool" behind. The transition from the strap’s recursion to the pool feels earned within the established dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, deepening the revelation from canvas to door to journal. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the painting into a map. However, the spatial logic of the door appearing behind the painting relies on a convenient dream-logic that lowers causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clear and the mechanical logic of the "unwinding" provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The discovery of the key relies on a ghost simply pointing it out, a minor convenience that softens the investigative causality.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is strong and governed by the story's unique logic; the "rupture" at closure is a decisive change earned by the printing process. The retrieval of the specific whisper via summary ("waited for me this morning") is slightly convenient, but the seamless integration of the climax compensates for this shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is sturdy, with Neris’s specific calibration driving the reveal. The resolution relies slightly on a fortuitous parallel in the second vision (the council scene), but it lands with sufficient thematic weight to satisfy the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic where metaphors (playing a scale backward to find a door) have solid causal weight within the genre's rules. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration," establishing a new, fragile balance ("hammered thin like leaf") that acknowledges the cost of breaking the truce. The transition into the "town of midnight" is handled smoothly, maintaining the story's mythic drive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with zero resistance; obstacles (the hidden path, the sealed door) yield immediately to the protagonist's tools or intuition without struggle. While the closure (becoming a caretaker) qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing, it feels unearned because the journey demanded nothing but attendance. The lack of friction flattens the arc into a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a legible Conceptual Repricing ("reimagine the delivery"), but the path there relies on convenient magical intervention—ghosts teaching knots—rather than problem-solving. The narrative arc is soft, with the slide acting as a tool that bypasses the physical difficulty of the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structure violates the short-story scope by summarizing a full year of activity rather than dramatizing a specific scene or shard. This montage approach dilutes narrative tension and causality, resulting in a low-cost closure that feels like an inevitable arrival rather than an earned result.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong, linking the diary's trap to the need for the debris key and the subsequent parley. The arrival of the watermen feels slightly convenient—immediate compliance with no friction—which accelerates the climax a bit too smoothly. However, the closure is resonant, fulfilling the "Conceptual Repricing" requirement by recontextualizing the nature of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative structure is distinct and effective, using the bottle's transformation from a container to a lens as a pivotal causal mechanism that enables the climax. The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration, where the arrival of others validates the alchemist's reality-building without resorting to the magic he rejected.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Situational lens that accumulates pressure through the ritual until the prophecy forces a decision. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's role, supported by clear on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: preparation, execution, success. While the closure (opening the atrium) is distinct, the lack of significant obstacles or causal setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc where the established internal logic—sound triggering the storm—pays off in a decisive closure moment. The tension builds naturally to the "zero hour" climax, and the resolution feels earned within the story's specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the salvage crew simply cancels a demolition order because of a beautiful moment; this lacks bureaucratic reality and earned causality. The climax is a montage of success that bypasses the friction required for a high-stakes payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is a linear progression of successful actions with no setbacks or complications. While the orientation and closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) are legible, the causality relies heavily on "contextual clues" to bridge gaps instantly. The lack of resistance makes the arc feel more like a ceremony than a story with narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural path, moving from a premise of broken time to a moment of healing. However, the progression is frictionless; obstacles (finding the silo, opening it, fitting the shard) yield immediately to the protagonist's presence. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "debt" mentioned is paid so swiftly by the secondary character that the structural cost feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands, but the resolution relies on a low-cost "soft reset" intervention. The repair is convenient and lacks the friction or failure risk required to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative pivots on an external event (the storm opening the pillar) rather than direct protagonist agency, which softens the causal drive. The closure lands as a "manifesto" (Conceptual Repricing) that resolves the arc intellectually, but the "inevitable" success lacks the tension of a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds atmosphere, but the resolution relies on abstract "data" (the ratio) rather than causal consequence, making the closure feel conceptually imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lyric structure is robust, teaching the "nature-as-grammar" logic effectively before applying it to the veteran's specific wound. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the interaction with the veteran solidifies the "submerged concord." The drive is Accumulative, building density until the final image of the "narrow vastness" ferries the reader out.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a linear "quest and solve" structure that lacks a Decisive Change with visible cost. The central mechanism—using a wax leaf to visualize audio grooves—relies on unexplained dream logic that clashes with the established physical grit of the setting, weakening causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc follows a clean Causal/Accumulative hybrid line: observation leads to hypothesis, which drives the physical realignment of the deck. The closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the instrument from a failed state to a new, enduring alignment ("north by endurance"). The pacing effectively mirrors the slow, heavy atmosphere of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from the climb to the chess trial to the clock with dream-logic causality that fits the genre. The closure (Conceptual Repricing: amending themselves rather than the sky) lands with resonant cost. The "secrets kept" line in the finale slightly muddies the mechanical resolution of the broken pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where the ritual of walking translates directly into narrative progression. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the final nod acts as a seal on the protagonist's new, burdensome identity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is solid, moving coherently from the inciting ascent through the ritual of the labyrinth to a decisive conceptual repricing at the rotunda. The closure is strong, using the "seed of breath" to anchor the abstract realization that home is a practice. The dream logic holds consistently, though the "time" aspect remains somewhat loose until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative creates a seamless Causal/Situational hybrid where the physical repair of the village mirrors the protagonist's psychological repair. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration); the cost is paid in the surrender of the pawn and the acceptance of the "tug" on the wrist.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's relationship to authority changes, but the mechanism—elders forgetting their rules because of "braided voices"—feels causally soft. The resolution relies heavily on symbolic logic rather than a concrete shift in power dynamics or leverage, though the orientation and pacing are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain where the specific method (reading the statue) directly enables the resolution. The closure is decisive and earned, reconfiguring the protagonist’s relationship to his craft and mentor with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting crack to the cave ritual and back with clear causality. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration; the release of the shell and the acceptance of the "stranger" reflection mark a decisive internal shift. The "wrong turn" beat feels slightly convenient (reliant on a suddenly recalled rumor), but the structural integrity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the return validates the ritual; the "whisper" logic holds under the Situational/Hybrid lens. While the resolution (Mara's arrival synchronizing with the ritual) relies on poetic rather than strict causality, the emotional payoff with Alder ("hand finds my shoulder") earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from the inciting mechanical failure to the resourceful solution and successful guidance. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "reverse migration" is not just a theme but the enacted plot, ending with a moment of earned stasis that feels complete and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from the setup of the trial to a decisive renunciation at the climax. The closure (hiding the eye to rely on "fractured grace") is a meaningful Resonant Reconfiguration. The courier's reappearance functions as a plot device to force the choice, though the lack of confrontation with them softens the external stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure relies on "dream logic" that strains plausibility in a realistic setting: specifically, the impossibility of seeing a small dried flower in a woman's hand on a passing ship at night from a lighthouse tower. Additionally, the deduction of a specific name from a ship's silence is opaque and lacks causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong, linking the discovery of the map to the cavern and the final choice. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the shop is repurposed as a shelter. The internal logic of the magical realism holds up well, though the transition from seeing alternate lives to helping neighbors relies on a quick associative leap.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from inciting distress to a resonant ritual closure where the "lungs" are balanced. The logic of the magic system (breathing, naming) follows a consistent dream-logic that holds up under the symbolic lens, providing a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (setup, calibration, success) with a clear accumulation of elements. Closure is achieved, but the &quot;cost&quot;—Lio's vulnerability—resolves instantly into laughter and stasis, lacking the grit or lasting price required for a higher band. The &quot;try again tomorrow&quot; ending lowers the sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a haunting inciting image (the grave) to a lucid dream confrontation and a resonant waking integration. Closure is exemplary: the act of editing the grave’s silence ("let the mouth keep eating the stone") is a Conceptual Repricing that earns its weight. The transitions between waking and dreaming are seamless, anchored by the consistent "chronicler" logic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, but the resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—the clock is fixed perfectly while also preserving the sentimental screw. This "have it all" ending avoids a hard tradeoff or felt cost, which is required for higher bands. The narrative moves smoothly but lacks a sharp causal turn that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tightly wound around the "held breath" constraint, creating immediate physical urgency that aligns with the magical mechanics. The climax (using superstitions to melt the frost) triggers a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the "hush before the saws" as a ticking clock that pays off beautifully in the closure. The transition from the ritual preparation to the imperfect manifestation and finally to the "saws began to argue" provides a complete, resonant arc. The closure (Earned Stasis) is distinct and costly: the orchard is lost, but the song is saved.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well, using the "three circles" pattern to build toward the resolution. Closure is achieved through a clear Conceptual Repricing, though the mechanism relies heavily on the magical logic established in the opening rather than a surprising causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Situational arc: observation, disruption, ritual intervention, and realignment. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts the "new throat" of time. The causality of the mantle key fitting the hydraulic valve relies heavily on symbolic logic, which works for the tone but softens the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resolution relies on abstract "magical" logic—using a laser pointer to signal "consent" to a mushroom network—which lacks established causality. The conflict dissolves through explanation rather than a dramatized struggle or structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—a moment of resonant reconfiguration using the lantern—is emotionally earned. However, the plot hinges on an astronomical coincidence (finding the father's specific handwriting on a random archive map) that resolves the conflict rather than complicating it, which strains credibility even within the theme of luck.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.3)
    The structure is episodic, and the pivotal climax is summarized ("She hears... he hears...") rather than dramatized, which robs the closure of visceral impact. The resolution mirrors the backstory examples exactly, offering a "soft ring" of success without a distinct cost or deviation from the established routine.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure works well for this ritualistic narrative, building pressure through the "small adjustments" recorded in the ledger. Closure lands effectively with the sealing of the book and locket, establishing a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief into protection.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a montage structure ("One rumor spoke," "That night," "By morning") covering an indefinite period, violating the short story scope default of a focused scene. The fable-like summary dissolves tension, presenting a procedural list of successes rather than a dramatic causal chain with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Lyric drive, moving effectively from entry to dowsing to the encounter and finally to the stillpoint. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the map is internalized ("made in him") and the tool re-calibrated to "poise."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with precision; the decision to create a "duet" rather than overwrite history is a resonant reconfiguration of the premise. The causality—fixing the tool to fix the timeline—holds firmly under the story's established logic of ritualized physics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on summary for the rising action ("We gather volunteers") rather than scenic dramatization of the effort. The climax resolves via a convenient coincidence (police captain seeing the deckhand) which dissolves the tension without cost or sacrifice. The narrative arc is linear but lacks causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure effectively utilizes the trail of clues to build momentum toward the archive discovery. While the mechanism of the tapestry opening the stone door tilts abruptly into fantasy without prior establishment, the closure is decisive and reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to fire and memory with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the setup of the experiment to a clear breakthrough and a resonant conclusion. Closure is achieved through "Charged Poise"—the protagonist accepts the ongoing cost (the blurring of self) to maintain the connection. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural shifting to Situational) holds firmly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is taut, with the wager providing a clear frame and the storm escalating the need for the protagonist's specific skills. The closure is resonant, transitioning from the challenge to a quiet, communal moment (buying silence with oranges). The late insertion of the mother's backstory explains the method after the fact rather than deepening the moment of action, which is a minor structural drag.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative operates under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens, where the ritual of light and shutters builds the necessary pressure to effect the rescue. The causality follows a coherent "fable logic" established in the first paragraph. Closure is achieved through a resonant return to stasis, with the mirror pocketed and the "ripple... return[ing]," marking a completed cycle of vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc follows a linear success trajectory—plan conceived, executed, and validated—without a significant reversal or moment of doubt to test the protagonist. Closure arrives as a soft confirmation of success ("second thoughts spread like fungi") rather than a decisive reconfiguration of stakes with visible cost. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression (Accumulative/Textural lens) that lacks causal resistance; the protagonist goes to the island, receives wisdom, and returns without facing a concrete obstacle that tests their resolve. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of an on-page cost makes the transformation feel unearned. Orientation is adequate, but the plot moves on rails of convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The situational drive lens holds perfectly; the arrival of the inspector applies pressure that crystallizes the protagonist's stance. Closure is an Earned Stasis that reconfigures the "hush" into something protective. The causal link between the performance and the inspector's compliance is lyrical but earned by the established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative functions as a ritual procession rather than a causal plot; obstacles (the guards, the ice) yield instantly to the protagonist's presence without imposing risk or necessitating a deviation in tactics. The lack of resistance flattens the arc into a linear sequence of successes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story operates on fable logic where poetic association supersedes causality; the resolution (fixing the bird) feels inevitable rather than earned. While orientation and closure are legible, the lack of resistance or complication makes the narrative arc feel flat and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, effectively building from the lab's setup to the communal experience. Closure is achieved through a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist commits to "new questions" rather than perfection, validating the pilgrimage's purpose with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ritual structure provides a solid spine, moving cleanly from assembly to execution to release. The esoteric mechanics (curtains, stencil) are taught early and pay off causally in the climax. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the progression is linear and lacks a sharp causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative logic, but the resolution relies on dream-like convenience ("drawn by steam") rather than earned causality. While the "reverse engineering" structure is taught, the transition from marking a map to a room full of people feels unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a decisive, irrevocable action (releasing the atoms) that carries visible cost ("opening a vein"). The drive lens is clear: the method (avoiding patterns) causally unlocks the archives, and the character's internal shift drives the final release. Structure is tight and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is excellent; the ritualistic progression from threat to resolution is logical and earned. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator sacrifices their personal tether (the stone) to bind the shadow, creating a tangible cost for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the aftermath of the con to a decisive resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—rebuilding the physical space alongside the relationship—with the cost of trust clearly felt. The pacing of the reconciliation is slightly compressed but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is excellent; the final Resonant Reconfiguration (the scar opening like a book) recontextualizes the premise with visible cost and thematic weight. The surreal causality of the "displaced miracle" is handled with confident logic, and the narrative drive holds firm under the lyric/hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from diagnosis to a ritualistic resolution ("harvesting") that reconfigures the setting's energy. Closure is strong—the projection of the "blank leader" as "mercy" offers a resonant image that reweights the initial problem of "aching reels," though the resolution feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with minimal resistance; the &quot;trap&quot; yields immediately to the instrument without a complication or reversal. Closure resolves the plot, but the &quot;cost&quot; (a thin line of cold) is asserted in narration rather than dramatized through a hard choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight Situational drive, structuring a ritualistic encounter with clear cause and effect. The closure lands effectively with a tangible cost (the freezing of the clock/veins) and a resonant shift in the world state (sparks distributed).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dream-logic structure holds together well, with the "tooth" reveal serving as a potent Conceptual Repricing at closure. The sequence moves clearly from wandering to the tower test, though the "translocate during sleep" mechanic feels like a convenient patch for scene transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from panic to patience), but the "guide-ex-machina" structure removes causal friction. The protagonist succeeds by following directions, which lowers the sense of earned resolution despite the stated cost of the vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and disciplined, moving from arrival to a decisive, resonant mechanical intervention. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bolt is placed not to break the machine immediately, but to enable future choice, a sophisticated outcome. The pacing holds tension well under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a defined closure unit (the exposure and erasure of the pretender). However, the resolution is low-resistance; the antagonist offers no effective counter-move, and the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through risk. The "rune of drift" functions somewhat as a deus ex machina, resolving the conflict instantly once triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory that pivots effectively into Causal action. The discovery of the "node" feels slightly convenient—Jun simply supplying the key word reduces the protagonist's agency in the epiphany—but the closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of how the community navigates the landscape with visible cost (safety is "never guaranteed").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a smooth, linear procedural path (inspect, wire, ignite, broadcast) that holds together logically but lacks a decisive turn or complication. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the city, yet the absence of a legible cost or risk makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (modifying the sigil) is a decisive change that lands firmly. However, the inciting mechanic—finding the kite with the exact necessary code "last week"—relies on convenient backstory summary rather than active discovery, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is solid, moving efficiently from the inciting pressure (storm/board) to a decisive action (relocation) and a resonant closure. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the photo and the "pearl" crystallize her stance on memory and safety. The pacing fits the short form perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands clearly, but the causal link between the tarot spread and the mechanical repair is symbolic rather than logical ("made a kind of map"). The resolution of the physical problem feels slightly like a soft reset, as the "untangling" is described as gentle and therapeutic rather than a struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear procedural arc (theory, experiment, confirmation, resolution) that supports the conceptual epiphany. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the protagonist's purpose, grounded in the confirmed limitation of the "widened second."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves closure via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the resolution—sharing tea with the enforcer—feels like a soft reset that evades the established stakes of treason. The cost is purely conceptual; the promised external consequences vanish conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative structure is excellent, with the "airship ballast sandbag scrap" serving as a masterclass in object work—introduced as a souvenir, utilized for chores, and finally repurposed to resolve the climax (stitching the dome). Closure is Resonant and distinct, with the father's final action feeling inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, successfully delivering a complete retrieval mission with legible closure. However, the beats feel slightly mechanical, ticking off required interactions with the magic system rather than driven by urgent, causal necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is robust, moving cleanly from the inciting call through the investigation to a decisive confrontation. The closure—a drafted statement and a return call—is a clear Decisive Change with the legible cost of lost prestige ("reduce our shine").

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal loop is executed with precision; the letters function as both a plot device and a thematic key that unlocks the closure (Conceptual Repricing). The orientation is immediate, and the "time folding" logic supports the narrative structure rather than serving as a gimmick. The ending lands with clear, felt cost and a satisfying click of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a satisfying ritualistic structure that aligns with the Accumulative lens. The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "banister" and "weather" signify a lasting internal shift with clear cost (destruction of the mandala, acceptance of unease). Orientation is established quickly and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resolution hinges on a structural coincidence: the patrol leader happens to be the exact figure revealed in the random mosaic vision. While closure is achieved via "Earned Stasis," the causality is situational and convenient rather than driven by a hard choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal arc from despair to renewal, anchored by the coin flip and the maze's reaction. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (Rowan's recommitment), though the resolution feels slightly convenient; the maze magically rearranging to reveal the solution lowers the sense of earned difficulty. The drive lens (Causal/Accumulative) remains stable, delivering a coherent if somewhat gentle ending.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative moves cleanly from the inciting shock to the choreographic experiment and resolution. The discovery of the hidden path to the loft relies on poetic logic—light revealing dust patterns—which strains strict causality but fits the accumulative/textural lens. Closure is earned through the grounding action and the decisive lie to the recall notice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear procedural structure that effectively builds an accumulative mood. However, the pivotal discovery relies on the convenient alignment of the heirloom with the cave imprint, a move that feels destined rather than earned through causal effort. Closure is achieved through a resonant transmission, fitting the meditative drive lens, though the "cost" of the action remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative logic suited to fable, but the resolution relies on a convenient revelation (the "withheld sentence" in the prophecy) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's struggle. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing that feels slightly unearned, as the solution was simply hidden in the text all along.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal; the protagonist's preparation directly enables the meeting and the resolution. The "engraving map becoming the inventory" is a clever pivot that ties the beginning to the end. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the radio's repair serving as a tangible proof of the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is a clean, resonant instance of "Resonant Reconfiguration," where the waiting and the river crossing mirror the internal simplification. The pacing is deliberate and fitting, though the reliance on the Coachman to overcome the physical obstacle (the tightened thread) softens the causal force of the protagonist's own choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and follows a clear accumulative logic, leading to a recognized closure (Conceptual Repricing). However, the progression relies on convenient magical success—the lantern immediately reveals the answer, and the environment yields to the first attempt at repair. The causality is soft; there is no moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with clear orientation and a resonant reconfiguration of the setting at closure. However, the progression is strictly linear with no meaningful obstacles; the lock yields easily and the plan works instantly, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, ritualistic structure that leads to a legible Conceptual Repricing closure ("coexist without craving reunion"). While the logic holds under a Situational lens, the progression is linear and low-resistance, relying on the magic system and compliant secondary characters to facilitate the shift without significant external friction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot follows a linear "build it and they will come" logic that lacks causal tension; the climax relies on the convenient arrival of the lost lover, resolving the conflict through wish fulfillment rather than protagonist agency or cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction but lacks the requisite narrative friction to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the causality of the technical solution is established early. The climax, however, relies on the technology working perfectly on the human antagonist to instantly resolve the threat, acting as a "magic bullet" that bypasses the need for a difficult interpersonal or moral choice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is coherent and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure—negotiating peace rather than forcing order—lands with earned conceptual weight. However, the plot arc is somewhat linear; the ritual succeeds without a significant complication or tightening beat where the initial plan falters, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from atmospheric setup to a tactile ritual that forces a confrontation. Closure is effective, with the Captain’s confession serving as a decisive change grounded in the scene’s action. The causality holds up well under a situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative compresses the resolution of the external plot ("We rush the samples... approval comes") into summary, which saps tension from the triumph before the final twist. Additionally, the copper nail functioning as both a sensor bridge and a precise fit for the intake screws relies on convenient "key-in-lock" logic rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence and magical assistance; the protagonist finds the essential glass flake in the dirt right when needed, and the wind conveniently guides them. The closure lacks a felt cost, as the object left behind was found only moments earlier, making the sacrifice negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to leave the money and walk the tracks recontextualizes the "circles" motif into a deliberate path. The structure efficiently manages the flashback to the startup without losing the present tension of the train yard. The "drive lens" holds steadily, accumulating thematic weight that pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure relies on a passive "follow the instructions" logic where the protagonist solves the central puzzle by simply reading the mentor's telegram. While orientation is clear, the causal link between variable star curves and grammatical syntax is purely lyrical, lacking the grounded logic required to make the solution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a Causal lens, moving from a clear objective to a decisive resolution with visible cost (blood and guilt). The closure (stopping the lake) effectively reconfigures the central stakes from deception to clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on dream logic where the resolution ("becoming what we were promised") arrives via ritual inevitability rather than protagonist agency or causal pressure. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without a legible "felt cost" or a hard choice that forecloses other options, resulting in a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is efficient, moving cleanly from the inciting quest to a resonant closure where the brother is transformed rather than simply restored. The internal logic of the "bartered destinies" market holds together, and the closure lands with a "Resonant Reconfiguration" paid for by the pledge to share breath. The pacing is steady, though the climax resolves relatively quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the narrator's goal from hiding a mistake to excavating a new history ("midwife a new story"). The drive lens (Causal/Situational) holds firmly, with the discovery of the cloth naturally escalating to the decision to dig. The coincidence of the specific tour is well-mitigated by Lark’s hiring motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative logic, building the ritual step-by-step to a clear point of closure (the refusal to bite the fruit). The ending creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship with the mentor. The explicit realization ("I understand now") slightly flattens the dramatic discovery by explaining it rather than letting the action of placing the fruit speak entirely for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, effectively establishing a routine and mood. While the "no tomorrow" premise is intriguing, the narrative lacks propulsion; problems are introduced and solved instantly by magic without causal friction. The closure is a valid Earned Stasis that resonates with the tone, though the lack of prior stakes softens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent within its fable-like logic, and the closure lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. However, the progression relies on a smooth magical causality where the ritual works instantly without complication or unforeseen consequence. The lack of friction in the transition from inspection to magical healing makes the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting return to the station to the discovery of the "WSP" clue and the decisive physical action. The closure is excellent; sealing the portal and correcting the atlas provides a tangible "Resonant Reconfiguration" that honors the "truth-seeking" goal without melodramatic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative constructs a tight, logical causal loop where the closure—the protagonist writing the second letter—successfully recontextualizes the opening hook (Resonant Reconfiguration). The progression from the harbor to the library and back is paced well, and the "unfolding cipher" provides a clear structural spine. The ending feels earned within the story’s internal logic, providing a satisfying, albeit intellectual, resolution to the time-loop premise.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is definitive and resonant: the violin is melted, the "promise" is kept, and the protagonist accepts the cost of leaving their life behind. The causal chain is tight, with the early establishment of the ice violin's nature paying off directly in the climax. The drive lens (Causal) holds firmly from the inciting incident to the irreversible final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a clear ritualistic arc that serves as a robust situational drive lens; the inciting incident (the note) naturally leads to the climax. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the continuity of their duty, earning the emotional shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is textural and accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lyrical mode. Closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, utilizing the hairpin to bind the new tendril, physically enacting the theme of healing with past wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where the metaphorical cloak becomes physical, creating a decisive structural shift. The internal logic of the story's magic system holds perfectly from setup to the final image of the porous ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Situational drive, using the lesson to structure the scene effectively. Closure lands cleanly with the researcher's disappearance, fulfilling the "Conceptual Repricing" requirement where the lesson's cost is the teacher's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map is redrawn and the pulse is freed through the narrator's stillness. The causal link between the sound inputs (humming, tapping) and the environmental outputs (gulls, pulse) is consistent and legible under the accumulative/textural lens. The narrative arc from testing to blocked path to resolution is tight and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands perfectly with a Conceptual Repricing of the mage's art, earned by the on-page physical renunciation of the tools. The causal link between the unstrapping action and the climax is tight, and the "mist walking" setup pays off structurally in the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure lands with a clear internal shift, but the scene suffers from severe time dilation and physics amnesia; the narrator performs extensive actions (reading a ledger, listening to a room ring, having an epiphany) on a single held breath underwater. This break in physical credibility undermines the groundedness of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is distinct and causal, moving from preparation to the casting of lots and the final transmission. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration," where the successful tuning shifts the state from waiting to "angled toward beginning," with the cost being the surrender of intent to the coins.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative structure is perfectly paced, layering individual vignettes to build pressure toward the personal climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration ("Enough") that recontextualizes the reaper's duty with legible conceptual cost. The mechanism of the tapes and atlas provides a sturdy causal spine for the lyrical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc centered on the ritual process, with a precise meaningful tightening when the bell falters and Nera must adapt her method. The closure is resonant, offering a restored world but enforcing a cost (patience/not fishing yet) that feels earned by the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative establishes a strong setup, but the climax suffers from a causal break: the warden radios for a pause, and townspeople immediately arrive at midnight ("People arrive hesitantly"). This logistical leap bypasses the necessary passage of time or communication, creating a "magical assembly" that strains plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative lens, gathering sensory details to reach a conclusion, but the lack of external pressure makes the pacing feel static. The closure—a decision to wait (Earned Stasis)—lacks a felt cost because the consequences of missing the "final transformation" are never established.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise: the established "blindfolded" training pays off causally when the buckle fails, solving the crisis through established character skills. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration of the narrator's duty, earning the stasis of the ending with a tangible sense of the "watcher's burden."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative establishes a legal conflict but resolves it through dream logic; the verdict "arose without announcement" bypasses the present antagonists (the advocates) rather than confronting them causally. While the ritual resolution is poetic, the external stakes dissolve conveniently rather than through a decisive, logical victory or compromise. Closure is resonant emotionally but structurally soft regarding the "custody battle" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story violates the scope default (single scene/two shards) by relying on a montage structure ("Two days later," "Each dawn," "Night after night") that spans months. This "chronicle" mode prevents the accumulation of immediate scene tension and reduces the plot to a summary of events rather than a dramatized narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tightly controlled; the ritualistic sequence moves logically from the summons to the specific mechanical intervention, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration of the household’s emotional state. The closure is earned, with the shift from grief to "possibility" landing as a tangible result of the protagonist's labor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic structure where the closure (Earned Stasis) lands effectively. The choice to refuse the door is a decisive non-action that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the setting and the guardian, satisfying the Accumulative drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, culminating in a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the staff's absence redefines power. However, the pivotal realization is undercut by a jarring tense shift in the "penny drops" line.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from preparation to execution to a Conceptual Repricing of the city's purpose from ruin to receiver. The pivot relies on a coherent internal logic ("discarding assumptions") that pays off with a tangible shift in the city's physical state at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is exemplary: a Decisive Change that is both physical and ontological, with a high, felt cost (becoming the "hinge"). The surreal logic of the ritual is established early and paid off strictly under the story's own rules without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is precise: installation leads to observation, which escalates to participation. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the weight of surrendered defenses, perfectly aligned with the "rational enchantment" drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates as a mosaic of time, bridging classroom instruction, political petitioning, and the final ascent. While the accumulative drive works well for this tone, the middle section relies on summary ("I petition," "We practice for weeks") to bypass the conflict with the council and the struggle of mastery. This lowers the immediate dramatic tension, though the closure—the ascent itself—lands with effective resonant poise and legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative logic holds within the magical realism frame—the city intervening via the shattering glass fulfills the narrator's promise that "it is the city's job to keep you safe." However, the villain's immediate retreat upon the glass breaking feels convenient, slightly undercutting the tension of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight Situational drive, utilizing the tidal window to enforce natural pacing and urgency. The closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, where the successful retrieval of the "laughter" reconfigures the vigil from a burden to a sustaining ritual. The arc is clean, causal, and emotionally complete within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The closure is legible, but the resolution relies heavily on the supernatural entity providing the solution (the ink map/corridor) rather than protagonist agency. The "corridor of air" removes the physical stakes of the descent, softening the causal cost of the decision to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear causal chain driven by the protagonist's methodology. The closure—a Decisive Change where identity is traded for the preservation of language—lands with undeniable weight and flows inevitably from the established logic of the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration ("cover metamorphose into a vow") that is causally linked to the ritual enactment. The logic of the "joke" magic system is consistent and pays off the setup without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the orchard breaking free) is decisive. However, the causality is softened by dream logic—statues turn from guards to allies instantly—which makes the resolution feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the individual struggle to a collective resolution via the "linking absences" mechanic. While the causal logic operates on a dream/fable level rather than strict mechanics, the closure—where reality overtakes the magical crutch of the bottle—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (find crown -> find fragment -> fix crown) with low causal tension. The inciting discovery relies on a convenient coincidence ("a wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis") rather than agentic problem-solving, which undercuts the satisfaction of the repair. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative structure successfully navigates dream logic without losing coherence, using the scarf and atlas as tangible pivots into the surreal. Closure is handled beautifully with an "Earned Stasis" where the librarian accepts their role, grounding the metaphysical journey back at the desk. The transition from general habit to the specific scene of the "quake" is managed well, keeping the reader oriented despite the shifting geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is coherent, and the closure (the unlatched door) lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The "message in the bottle" mechanic—where the photo literally spells out instructions—feels slightly convenient, directing the protagonist rather than forcing them to derive the answer solely from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is distinct and lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) via the "shoes off" image and the surrender of the box. The narrative arc is clean and linear, though the resolution feels slightly inevitable given the Locksmith's immediate competence and the lack of active obstacles once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands decisively with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the transaction of the song and the name correction resolves the narrative debt with legible cost ("sting me awake," "weight of a hand"). The causal logic of the folklore magic is established early and adhered to strictly, ensuring the ending feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative structure is seamless, moving from the inciting arrival to the ritualistic climax with precise magical causality. The closure is excellent, offering a Decisive Change for the siblings and an Earned Stasis for the Archivist that carries genuine emotional cost ("my feet wanted to walk backward, but I held still"). The "reversible exile" mechanic is taught and executed with impeccable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot operates on dream logic where obstacles vanish the moment the protagonist wills it (the apple whispers, the door opens, the Gray submits). Causality is replaced by frictionless magic, leading to a "fix-it" resolution that lacks earned stakes or a legible price paid for the happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a clear objective to a satisfyingly surreal resolution that feels earned by the established logic. The causal link between the physical action (untying knots) and the metaphysical result (raising the coffer) is intuitive and compelling. Closure is definitive, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the daughter's burden and the narrator's ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The investigative arc is clean, effectively moving from the map's damage to the archives and finally the site. The resolution relies on a poetic coincidence—the map's random tear shape matching the door's wear pattern—which softens the causal rigor slightly, but the closure is resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is distinct and impactful, with the release of the globe serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, plausibility is strained by the mechanics of playing magnetic tape underwater (saltwater conductivity, head acoustics) and the heavy coincidence of the ticket stub perfectly matching the radio message.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure fits the lyric mode well, building logically from the setup to the connection and request. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the promise of the open console) and a paid cost (leaving the bolt plate), though the narrative arc is linear with minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ten-floor countdown creates a precise, escalating structural spine that forces pacing and compression. Closure is decisive and resonant: the delivery transforms from a simple errand into a ritual of erasure, with the "forgetter room" providing a clean, high-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative operates under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens that successfully transitions into a Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The final act—tying a knot to the "cylinder of absence"—reconfigures the story's reality with a legible cost to the narrator's grip on sanity. The logic of the "negative monument" holds together the surreal cause-and-effect without breaking the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure is strong, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the room is ontologically transformed before destruction. The causal link between the coin's "coordinates" and the artistic act of painting a sky is poetic but mechanically tenuous; the leap from "wandering stars" to painting guidance relies on dream logic rather than established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on convenience plotting, particularly the "dusty hopscotch board" acting as a precise navigational tool, which strains causality even within a fantasy frame. Closure is tidy and symmetric ("tea into a cracked cup"), offering satisfaction without a felt cost or a meaningful reordering of the character's world.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with soft causality; the repair succeeds because the protagonist employs poetic logic ("stories," "oil that remembers") rather than overcoming resistance. Closure lands as a completed task without a felt price or meaningful "decisive change" in the character's status or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure—instruction, execution, success—where the outcome feels pre-ordained by the ghost's competence. The closure brings relief without a complication or "failure state" that would test the plan, resulting in a resolution with low causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a tight, ritualistic arc that moves coherently from the dread of dusk to the reprieve of the lullaby. Closure is excellent; the "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the lighthouse beam—from warning to welcome—lands with thematic weight and felt cost. The mention of inland sirens effectively raises the stakes without breaking the lighthouse's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative drive is impeccable; the backstory of the nut is efficiently planted to serve as the mechanical solution in the climax. The closure is a strong "Earned Stasis," where the caretaker remains but reconfigures their relationship to the orchard's design.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the mechanism of the resolution (building a load-bearing polymer bridge overnight with a field kit) strains verisimilitude, operating more like magic than chemistry.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is a pristine two-beat sequence (customer transaction → narrator transaction) that escalates intimacy without losing the "lull" atmosphere. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the "index opened to a chapter called Before" recontextualizes the concept of absence into a generative force. The causal logic of the magic system holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear procedural structure (diagnosis, gathering, ritual, cure) that fits the length well. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the city's mood, validated by the castellan. While logical and satisfying, the progression feels somewhat inevitable, lacking a sharp causal turn or reversal to spike the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a "soft reset" resolution: the councilman’s opposition evaporates instantly due to the coincidental discovery of the glove, bypassing the need for Mara to win him over through agency or sacrifice. The bridge construction (one night, manual labor) strains credibility even for a fable, lacking the logistical friction that gives magic realism its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, guiding the reader through a ritual that leads to a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure ("refusing to fossilize the living"). The causality follows a dream logic that fits the premise, though the mechanism is purely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no decisive turning point or meaningful cost; the protagonist succeeds at every step without genuine complication. The ending returns to the status quo with a promise of repetition ("I would return") rather than a resonant reconfiguration, failing the requirement for a closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear process (wait, play, leave) that functions well as a vignette but lacks a decisive turn or structural tightening. Closure is a soft "Earned Stasis" with the cost limited to abstract patience rather than a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is a linear ritual that suffers from convenience; the potential external complication (the guard) is dismissed ("looked up once, then away") without altering the protagonist's tactics. The resolution relies on the board simply accepting the moves, resulting in a "magic fix" ending that lacks causal grit.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing an Accumulative structure (collecting silences) that pivots effectively to a Conceptual Repricing at the climax (the fennel sprig recontextualizing the fireworks). The closure is legible and resonant. The score is held back from the highest bands because the "cost" of the opening is mitigated by the protagonist's pre-emptive disinterest in the words, lowering the tension of the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on broad summary ("Seasons braided") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope default and diluting causal urgency. The closure is a thematic assertion rather than a result of accrued on-page pressure, reading more like a parable than a structured story.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc (launch, ascent, discovery, repair, descent) with legible closure. The "Conceptual Repricing" of the arrow tip from weapon to plug is a satisfying turn. However, the introduction of the "shard of black glass" as the specific antagonist force appears late and feels like a convenient lock for the protagonist's key, slightly weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is excellent; the investigation proceeds through precise, logical steps to a specific physical solution (the empty square and unlatched door). The closure—imposing a new "breathing grid" protocol—is a Decisive Change that is fully earned by the preceding survey.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure where the "field test" frame provides a clear goal but lacks causal friction. The synchronization with the sculptor proceeds smoothly, and the central obstacle is overcome instantly ("I stepped where green asked") without complication. Closure arrives as a completed task (Earned Stasis) rather than a decisive turn with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator relinquishes ownership of the seam ("let others carry banners"). The re-arrangement of the driftwood markers provides a tangible, resonant image that physically manifests this internal shift with clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "vanishing stars" operate as an effective ticking clock that forces the closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the characters accept their interval of peace. The narrative arc is tight, with the printing ritual grounding the abstract stakes in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc toward a Decisive Change closure. The mechanism of the pendant is established early, creating a functional causal loop when the courier interrupts the "dangerous" sweetness to restore sharpness. The pacing is efficient, though the brevity compresses the escalation of the "danger" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is a clear ritual progression with valid closure in the Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's relationship to objects. However, the pivotal reveal—finding the father's trace in a car explicitly described as holding "other people's history"—relies on unearned coincidence or opaque magic rules, creating a causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is coherent: the ritual requires a cost (the bead and patience), and the payoff (the sister's return) is earned by that expenditure. The "seasons later" transition dilutes the immediate tension of the scene slightly, shifting the mode from dramatic presence to summary, but the closure firmly resolves the central desire.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain of repairs accumulating toward stability, supported by the specific magic system. While the resolution is distinct, the final and most costly repair (trading childhood laughter) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to a decisive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change) that effectively reweights the world. The reliance on the "cyclically spontaneous" trait to drive transitions ("my leaps come unbidden") introduces a slight passivity to the middle section, functioning as a convenient mechanism to advance the plot rather than causal agency. The ending lands with satisfying structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the creation of the "unburning lantern," a distinct and costly image. The drive lens shifts smoothly from Accumulative to Situational as the final run forces a specific, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is pristine: the protagonist’s specific mistake (laughing early) lures the storm, necessitating the ritual that resolves it. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—the storm is transformed rather than defeated—and the conceptual cost (“felt older and lighter”) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    A flawless structural execution for this scope; the narrative moves efficiently through observation, experiment (the wing), and instruction to a resonant closure. The ending achieves a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist's stance toward the donor heart is fundamentally altered with visible conceptual cost (surrendering control to become a "lens").

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, moving from routine to a specific, charged moment of inquiry. The closure serves as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing sorrow as "soil that grows bearings." The cost is paid in patience and the physical toll of the "ache in my knees," earning the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is a linear procedural: gather, process, release. While the pacing is controlled, the arc lacks a causal twist or a moment of genuine jeopardy; the success feels inevitable from the start, making the closure feel like a completed checklist rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands with a concrete action (writing the note), satisfying the structural need for resolution. However, the central mechanic—a backward-bound journal curing grief—relies on dream logic that strains credibility within the physical scene, and the orientation of the "mistake" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure effectively follows a ritualistic arc—preparation, action, communion, departure—that suits the accumulative drive lens. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the space and the characters' commitment, offering a clear "Earned Stasis," though the narrative arc is gentle and lacks sharp turns.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative structure is masterfully handled, escalating from observation to intervention to personal reflection. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts the ambiguity of their own vow—lands with distinct conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tight and driven by the protagonist's manipulation of the "false starts" to wear down the antagonist's defenses. The closure—rejecting the material wealth of the map for the recorded truth—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a coherent ritual arc with a clear Accumulative logic, moving smoothly from arrival to release. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the "debt" is cleared—lands effectively, though the resolution relies on the aurora functioning as a mechanism to solve the problem rather than a solution forged by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight, moving cleanly from the physical obstacle (broken lock) to the creative solution (painting) and emotional resolution. The closure lands with a decisive change in the narrator's state, earned by the on-page action of drawing. The "foreclosure" mention at the end feels slightly disconnected from the immediate cave scene, but the overall structure holds the drive lens well.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and compelling, moving from a clear inciting incident (vanishing words) to a specific quest and a resonant resolution. The discovery of the map is slightly convenient, but the causal link between the confession (payment) and the resolution (opening the Ear) is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual procedural—preparation, execution, success—without a causal turn that alters the outcome. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the ritual works exactly as intended, lacking a decisive change or felt cost that reconfigures the status quo. The situational drive is coherent but devoid of narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tight; the magnetic shift (inciting incident) necessitates the controlled burn (climax) to enable the breach. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, planting seeds in a new world with visible cost (loss of the dome) and clear agency.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality collapses under a massive coincidence: the random locket in the donation bin just happens to contain a map of the specific mailbox and a makeshift key. The resolution relies on this convenient Deus Ex Machina rather than the "neighborhood storytelling" mechanism promised, and the ending offers symmetric satisfaction with no cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, but the causality relies heavily on "lyrical logic" where dance moves conveniently hack security systems without established rules or resistance. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the "daemon" offers no meaningful opposition to the protagonist's methods.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative logic follows a compelling surreal causality, moving from the omen (leaning flame) to the method (grounds) to the retrieval (salt) and release (whale). Closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration that alters the town’s state with legible conceptual cost. The "gravity pockets" serve as effective plot devices that guide the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to Earned Stasis, effectively closing the "door," but the resolution lacks a visible, felt cost. The climax—turning the wing—feels effortless, and the consequence (prophecy forgotten) is abstract. Without a distinct price paid by the summoner, the closure feels technically complete but emotionally lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural trajectory, building density through the tea ritual and the seal's lesson to a resonant closure. The structure is coherent, and the final beat (the seal's impression on the wrist) creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's status. However, the progression is linear and lacks a pivotal turning point where the outcome was genuinely in doubt, limiting the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is strong, moving logically from the garden routine to the decisive crisis at the arch. The closure is distinct and transformative, with the protagonist fundamentally altering their nature to resolve the conflict, though the "winter of sirens" backstory remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with precision; the ritual action creates a legible change in the world state (guilds unbound) while maintaining the thematic constraint of "mercy" over destruction. The "key" and "thorn" function as distinct causal mechanisms rather than generic props, driving the scene's logic. The ending successfully reconfigures the status quo with a clear conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear Causal drive, but the resolution relies on symbolic ease (singing dissolves the antagonist) rather than a hard-won turning point. The prompt phrases ("progressive disclosure") are inserted mechanically, disrupting the causal logic of the mythic setting.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective ritual structure from arrival to revelation, with the "dreams" logic established early to justify the method. Closure is distinct and satisfying, delivering the name "Leda" and a commitment to action (exposure) that reconfigures the protagonist's path. Orientation in the ice shrine is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, adhering perfectly to a fable logic where a mystery (the thief) is recontextualized into a lesson (mercy). Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the "thief" becomes a savior, and the net is redesigned. The pacing is smooth, though the resolution comes easily to the wise protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands effectively with a distinct ethical choice that resolves the central tension. However, the pivotal discovery mechanism—reconstructing loose shredded papers found in a wind-battered ruin—strains physical plausibility and feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on broad summary ("Across the rise of a prophet") rather than dramatized scene work, violating the scope default for short fiction. The resolution—the council "blinking" because of a song—lacks sufficient on-page causal grounding, feeling more like a poetic assertion than an earned plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, using the music box as a clear causal thread that bridges the inciting incident to the resolution. The closure is strong, offering a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the poet's status in the community, though the storm functions more as an atmospheric intensifier than a strictly causal plot point.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a tense standoff to a resonant resolution without wasted motion. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "theft" is replaced by a shared burden, satisfying the stakes with visible emotional cost. The mechanism of resolution relies heavily on the artifact's established rules, but the execution remains causal and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on summary rather than scene for the pivotal event (the crossing), which deflates tension. The story solves its central problem via a controlled demonstration rather than a high-stakes test, resulting in closure that feels conceptually complete but emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structuring is excellent, with a tight causal chain from the discovery of the tool marks to the decision to leak the report. Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "Decisive Change" criteria with a tangible career cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is excellent, with a clear causal chain moving from diagnosis to realization to a concrete plan of action. The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chaplain moves from a binary choice (praise/warning) to a creative third option (apprenticeship), grounding the resolution in a tangible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quest structure is clear, and the closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bell's ringing shifts the protagonist's relationship to the world. The transition to the "inward" map at the end relies on summary reflection rather than a dramatized consequence of the climax, slightly weakening the causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot moves with precision, utilizing the physical object (patch) to bridge the digital investigation in a satisfying causal chain. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist redefines the nature of the archive itself, choosing protection over exposure. The ending lands with inevitable weight, holding the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The two-shard structure (repairing the object, then using it) effectively bridges the backstory and the climax. The transition is legible, and the closure lands with a concrete "Decisive Change" as the envoys commit to specific resource costs (sleds, cellars). While the resolution relies heavily on the magical object, the logic is established early, preventing a feeling of unearned convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure successfully bridges the "euthanasia tourist" premise with the "disaster relief" action, creating a coherent hybrid drive. Closure is decisive and earned; the choice to "postpone" lands with visible emotional cost and thematic resonance, effectively reconfiguring the protagonist's stance toward time.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is excellent; the exchange of the letter fragment for the traveler’s courage creates a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page. The scene flows logically from the encounter to the advice to the decisive action (the call) without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative builds a satisfying accumulative arc, moving from technical preparation to a resonant spiritual closure. The ending feels earned through the established labor of the characters, delivering a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the space that holds steady under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from setup to accumulation to a resonant closure via the "wing" image. The storm provides a functional mid-scene complication, though it resolves relatively easily with "heavier twine." The closure effectively reconfigures the installation into a "single wing," successfully landing the Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, building from the private experiment to the public testimony. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the room's purpose shifts from storage to growth. The resolution with the custodians feels slightly frictionless—they capitulate quickly to the demonstration—but the final image of the "garden of ears" provides satisfying conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tightly wound around the story's unique logic; the "future instructions" mechanic pays off beautifully in the refusal to rewind at the closure. The narrative arc from seeking the sound to capturing the "exhale" is coherent and structurally sound under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resolution relies on a breakdown of established physical logic: using an audio recording of a leaf to physically "seat pins" via "borrowed gravity" strains credibility in a setting established with "gyros" and "fiber." While the closure image is resonant, the mechanism of the fix feels like a poetic cheat that bypasses the mechanical problem set up in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative structure is clear and the "flawless goodbye" constraint provides a solid closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the timeline suffers from "teleportation" issues; Lena answers from a bus in city traffic and arrives at the bedside within the span of a single song. This convenient compression undermines the realism of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative structure is impeccable; the central inquiry drives the action linearly while the "model building" sequence serves as a perfect structural fractal of the theme (closing loops). Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to knowledge shifts from extraction to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, linear fable with legible closure that resolves the central mystery. However, the progression relies on convenient, frictionless magical discovery ("Mara... knew exactly which leaf to lift") rather than causal struggle, making the sequence feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies entirely on iterative summary ("Before dawn I enter") and flashback, failing to establish a specific, time-bound scene; the lack of a concrete "now" prevents legitimate dramatic escalation and violates the scope default.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure works well for this quiet, post-climactic reflection. The narrative moves logically from the return to the specific labor, anchoring the closure (a refusal to speak publicly yet) in the physical act of gardening. The orientation is clear, and the pacing suits the introspective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure coheres well under the dream logic, gathering tokens that pay off in the final ritual. Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing of the creative process ("drift forward by going backward"), with the choice to resist the "easy ending" providing a legible turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of success without causal pressure or obstacles; the outcome is guaranteed from the start. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the ritual works perfectly, offering no decisive change or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens: preparation, execution, and result, leading to a legible Decisive Change (the map is printed). While the linear "ritual success" structure lacks a major mid-scene complication to test her adaptability, the closure is earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, where the "lyric logic" of using echoes to fix a clock holds together beautifully. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (civic time replaced by "wounded" natural time), though the cost remains largely abstract and aesthetic rather than visceral. The progression is smooth and competent, but the lack of significant setbacks keeps the arc from feeling urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative-to-Situational arc, moving from collecting tasks to a specific confrontation with the Valley. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis, with the weaver accepting the "circle" of service, providing a legible if somewhat static resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly constrained by the "kettle boiling" timeframe, creating an effective Accumulative structure. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where the finished object re-contextualizes her grief, landing with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear arc within a surreal logic system, moving from collection to negotiation to sacrifice and resolution. The closure is decisive: the carousel restarts, and the price is paid. While the ghost's acceptance of "stories" operates on dream logic, the causal link between the sacrifice (the vow) and the result (motion) is thematically earned and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure lands, but the causality is frictionless. The sequence moves from problem to solution without setbacks or tightening options, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative traces a clear, causal arc from the inciting desire to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" at closure. The ending lands with conceptual weight, redefining the bell’s silence not as failure but as a "reunion," effectively repricing the initial stake.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central deductive leap—scratches on a pocket sundial matching mud-initials and pointing to a specific conduit via a "noon line"—strains causal credibility even within the story's heightened reality. However, the closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, breaking the established silence with a decisive public exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative to Situational arc, moving from decoding to instruction. The closure functions as a valid Charged Poise, where the tools for the future conflict (the council) are assembled and the "weapon" (the language) is transferred. The logic of the magic system is consistent, and the ending reconfigures the rope from refuse to evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The arrival of the letter resolves the central tension via off-screen convenience, contradicting the premise of isolation ("last ship," "storms ended trade") that necessitated the protagonist's role. This logic break undercuts the causality of the narrative, rendering the "living obituary" service retrospectively ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly paced, moving clearly from the inciting discovery to the climax. While the resolution relies slightly on the fable-trope of the song silencing opposition, the closure lands with a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the world’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well for this ritualistic narrative, leading to a resonant closure with the singing trees. The pacing is steady, though the inciting arrival and the encounter with the boy feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quest structure is clean and linear, leading to a satisfying resolution where the city wakes. The pivotal moment—unlocking the panel with a secret—operates on dream logic appropriate for the genre, and the closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully executes a fable-like structure under an accumulative lens. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration of tradition—lands well, though the progression faces little causal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently to the "heaviest evening," and the loosening of the braid offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The reliance on the grandmother's direct instruction to solve the central puzzle slightly softens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tightly wound; the magical logic of the handle driving the weight adjustment creates a clear "because/therefore" chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the physical weight change and the "slimmer sound," successfully externalizing the internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ritualistic structure creates a clear situational arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Causality follows the established magical logic effectively, though the episodic nature of the conflict (correcting a single ghost) keeps narrative propulsion modest.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.0)
    Closure is achieved too easily; the antagonist (the Council) capitulates immediately upon seeing the model ("resistance softened like frost in sun"), bypassing the necessary struggle or negotiation. There is no legible cost paid for the victory; the protagonist gets exactly what they wanted without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and effectively structured under a Situational/Accumulative lens, moving from private ritual to communal restoration. The "Orientation Test" passes easily, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's isolation is broken. The arrival of the stranger acts as a satisfying payoff to the established radio mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rocking chair functions as an excellent structural pacer, governing the scene's rhythm and creating tangible pressure. The closure—scattering ash into the cracks of the mask—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that physically manifests the change.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure violates the short-story scope default (one continuous scene) by spanning weeks and summarizing key conflicts ("The Archivists offered... The Choir offered..."). While the causal chain is logical, the montage approach diffuses the tension of the inciting discovery and renders the climax ("I chose the third way") as a retrospective statement rather than an enacted moment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is clean and the "nick" in the rosette provides a functional pivot for the climax. However, the resolution—unlearning hatred via a single breathing exercise and a brief anecdote—feels fable-like and lacks the friction of a paid cost, bordering on symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the ritual progression creates a legible arc, but the pacing accelerates too conveniently at the climax. The seed sprouts and resolves the immediate tension with a "magic bullet" effect that bypasses the need for a tactical trade-off or complex causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the tower lighting up) is concrete. However, the resolution relies on "convenient inventory"—the narrator happens to have both the riddle and the recorded hum ready in a box. This "lock-and-key" plotting reduces causal tension, as the solution is applied rather than forged through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates well as an atmospheric vignette under an Accumulative lens, with a clear beginning and end. However, the narrative arc is flat; the ritual proceeds without complication or unexpected resistance, leading to a "soft" resolution (an agreement of company) that feels aesthetically pleasing but structurally low-cost. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration, but the lack of a decisive turn or obstacle limits its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path where obstacles dissolve immediately upon contact with the narrator's empathy. While the closure (the city rebuilding through listening) is coherent, the absence of causal setbacks or a "dark night of the soul" makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is excellent; the "prison and a path" realization serves as a resonant Earned Stasis that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the climb. The narrative arc moves cleanly from the memory of the "chipped dice" choice to the confrontation with the rupture. Causality follows a rigorous dream-logic that feels inevitable rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is executed with precision, using the ledger entries to build density toward the final "inkless vow." The closure lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, validating the method with a clear conceptual cost (hope as a discipline).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The connection between the bread initials and the sluice markings provides a satisfying, earned resolution to the central puzzle. However, the climax relies partly on environmental convenience (the timed thaw) rather than a decisive character action that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight and dream-logic consistent; the mechanism's activation leads directly to a consequence that reconfigures the protagonist's life. The closure is excellent—not a simple success, but an "Earned Stasis" where he must maintain a marginal existence. The "clue in the bunkhouse" is a slight convenience, but the focus remains properly on the execution and its price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a decisive closure driven by the protagonist's active choice to confess. However, the reliance on the "notes" as a literal instruction manual creates a slight "fetch quest" feel to the magic system rather than organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is tight and follows the established internal logic of the magic system (tuning/resonance) without breaking suspension of disbelief. The narrative arc moves cleanly from threat (swell) to preparation (diagram) to execution (concert) and resolution. Closure is a satisfying Earned Stasis, where the defense holds. The "adjustment" to the shifting clouds provides the necessary pivot point, preventing the victory from feeling entirely automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving efficiently from the inciting constraint (rusted gate) to the breakthrough and revelation. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the physical situation remains dangerous ("not safe"), but the conceptual understanding has shifted ("oriented"), delivering a satisfying structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative operates on fable logic where decoding a letter instantly summons the entire town without mechanical plausibility. While the linear progression is clear, the lack of resistance and instant resolution undermines causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative drive lens fits the cataloging action, and the closure (Earned Stasis) successfully lands the final image. However, the narrative lacks a sharp causal turn, relying on the predictable tide rather than protagonist agency to force the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, utilizing the blackout as a functional constraint that enables the protagonist's discovery. The closure achieves a "Charged Poise," where the immediate environment is reconfigured (the arrow, the indexed ledgers) to set a trap for truth, offering a satisfying conceptual resolution with visible cost (restraint).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective ritual structure—preparation, ascent, release, and reconfiguration. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow returns instead of the lost lover, offering a satisfying emotional shift. The pacing is steady, though the drive relies heavily on atmospheric accumulation rather than urgent causal branching.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is definitive and resonant; the refusal to extract the "potential" functions as a Decisive Change that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the institution and their own trauma. The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from the hunt's setup to the discovery and the subsequent moral stance. The cost—institutional backlash and the forfeiture of a breakthrough—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing (CR): the failure of the chip to cast letters reconfigures the goal into mapping the "rests" and "blanks." The causal chain from the drone calibration to the realization is tight and logical under the Accumulative lens. The "cost" is intellectual and poetic—accepting absence as the map—which fits the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The watch hand fitting perfectly into a driftwood groove acts as a convenient puzzle-mechanic resolution to the mystery, bypassing causal struggle. While the closure is emotionally resonant, the mechanics of the discovery strain plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ritualistic structure is solid, creating a clear container for the action with a legible micro-turn involving the prisoner Daro. Closure is achieved through a resonant return to stasis, though the resolution to the standoff—pointing to a ledger—feels slightly convenient given the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear trajectory from launch to arrival and confession. Orientation is immediate and grounded. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "counting utility poles" denouement feels slightly prolonged and lowers the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The two-shard structure efficiently bridges the fantastical lake and the realistic market, delivering a complete arc. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts "repair" over "absolution," validated by the on-page price of confession.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear linear progression from arrival to ritual to transformation. The closure is decisive and resonant, effectively answering the story's central question. However, the path is low-resistance; the ritual functions smoothly without external complications or setbacks, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is immediate and grounding despite the surreal setting. The structure follows a clear ritual logic (setup, alignment, recovery, return) under a causal lens. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the minutes are recovered, but the protagonist is changed by the "cloudbound repentance" and the promises made.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "quilted" ship image successfully transforms the initial "patchwork" state. The progression from the "warhead" refusal to the "shadow work" breakthrough is causal and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a retrospective deus ex machina where the protagonist conveniently placed the exact tools needed for the rescue days earlier. This "orchestrated coincidence" drains the climax of immediate agency and struggle, as the solution was pre-baked rather than earned in the moment. The drive lens is situational, but the resolution depends on an implausible level of foresight that breaks suspension of disbelief for a realist literary aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the fort and the sentinel's role—lands clearly. However, the causality is frictionless; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles, making the progression feel linear and convenient (e.g., guards patrolling exactly where they should to allow the intrusion).

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic logic where the accumulation of pattern and intent forces a change in the world's physics. The closure—gravity obeying the promise—lands with earned conceptual weight, effectively reconfiguring the "frictionless" problem. The logic of the magic system is consistent, though the middle section slightly loops on the description of the method before advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Accumulative" drive lens, building pressure through the storm and the ritualistic wait rather than causal twists. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the act of reading reclaims the silence, offering a satisfying and earned release of the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting arrival through a ritualized conflict to a collaborative resolution. The closure is a strong example of Resonant Reconfiguration, where the relationship status shifts decisively based on the puzzle solution, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc from ruin to restoration, and the closure (naming the library) is resonant. However, the transition from isolated struggle to community embrace is rapid and lacks causal struggle; neighbors arrive without friction, smoothing the tension rather than escalating it. The police car moment is a refusal that carries no visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The surreal logic of the film-clock mechanism is consistent and compelling. However, the closure relies on a "told" cost ("some currencies ruin what they buy") rather than a dramatized price; the reunion feels like a "soft reset" that evades the darker implications hinted at by the text.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ritualistic structure is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the completed audit. The causality follows a consistent dream-logic, though the resolution to the "missing treaty" crisis feels slightly convenient (an immediate discovery via dream) rather than a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure works well, building sensory weight toward the ritual's completion. The closure is legible and provides a resonant reconfiguration of the compass's meaning. The narrative relies on magical realism logic that is established early, ensuring the ending feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of strikes builds to closure's Charged Poise as wave "flared outward, divided and softened," reconfiguring defiance into conversation with undeniable ongoing-watch cost legible in final tapping. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, pattern taught early pays off cleanly. One tightening via cloud readings suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from maps to hexagons, culminating in CR closure ("knowledge stings and steadies") reweighting loss as safer waters with conceptual cost in "sunwashed dread like a cautionary map." One tightening via whistle alignment opens gate without force. Orientation anchored early in city/turtles/gate.

One tightening via Daro's refusal narrows options. No orientation debt; lens clear; cost legible in final chest click and mist lift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from spices to animal arrivals to transformation, yielding on-page Resonant Reconfiguration where birds meet with felt cost of relinquished humanity. Orientation anchors immediately in orchard arrival. No lens ambiguity; persistent spice constraint shapes every tactic to charged closure image of feather-speech reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to card-spread reservoir and cloud-gathering; closure as Charged Poise in palm-resizing pour, cost legible in "widening, as if making room for the fist" with promised sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds density to RR closure via stitched seam and vowed bargain holding unhealable parts; cost legible in thumb-prick drop and ongoing work, with pattern taught early in tear-map shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify to Charged Poise closure ("the path holds... I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee"), with felt fragile cost legible in final image; orientation anchored early in dawn/sea/eel herder.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of storm imagery and reflections builds to CR closure in "hush of ink drying on sky," reweighting scars with conceptual cost of reclaimed language legible in the reading beat. Orientation anchored early in climb and dome entry. Persistent constraint of timer shapes tactics across waits.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reel insertion to arbor music spilling to Mara stepping into color, landing Charged Poise RR in four clock ticks notching night with conceptual cost of unasked price. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; pattern taught early via film splice pays off cleanly. No ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building through dream harvests to seed planting and treaty recital; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in sapling burst and monsoon with legible cost of chosen release: "washing only what we chose to release."

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to pool glow (blue uncurled), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where compass rests inward, reweighting regret with undeniable emotional cost in final image.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the greenhouse tuned to “half light and half hours” reweights all prior beats under the “slope not cliff” rule; cost is the forfeiture of full restoration and of heroic narrative. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dust, tape, and slow decay—taught by line 8 and held without lapse. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“storm-damaged greenhouse”). No causal break; even the butterfly-wing map is prepared by “lepidopteran air.”

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the kiln re-ignites and the glass piece re-weights the arson from warning to invitation. Causal lens holds throughout—because the fire happened, therefore the canyon is entered, therefore the kiln speaks back—ending in a Charged Poise where the cost is the artist’s acceptance of smugglers possibly tracing the route. The ledger-frost alignment beat (p.4) is the visible hinge that teaches the pattern. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of frost-stave → heat-map → sleeve-seal tightens meaning once, then reweights at bell tower. Closure is Charged Poise: “my answer rising without volume” crystallizes options—soundless music as perpetual motion—while conceptual cost (endless winter, no true sound) is undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; transitions (ferry → conservatory → tower) are legible shards under same lens. No causality breaks; every escalation is density increase, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he surfaces with a mended lens and a reciprocal address written in water/stone, the conceptual cost unmistakable. Under Accumulative lens the pattern of stillness → tapping → cataloguing → second stillness is taught early and tightens via re-shelving; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and the underwater drawer is sketched with spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the bell that once accepted insulin and rings-to-come is left holding only an unsigned seed-note, re-weighting the anonymity rule with undeniable social cost. Causality is intact—Noor’s accusation → braided route → exchange of memories → lighter bell—each step narrowing future options under an accumulative lens. The 120-word orientation gate is met; ridge, arbor, sanctions-night are anchored before the bell first gleams. One minor scuff: the “amplified quiet” refrain edges toward thematic echo, but it is embedded in image and paid off in the final breath, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the storehouse of unused love is re-defined as the ribcage itself, and the key is to spend breath in “attentive kindness.” The before/after is legible—same arches, new circuit—and the cost is the perpetual spend of breath, not a one-time fix. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of breathing exposures intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each bridge-crossing layers temporal echoes until the halo-dust reweights the garden’s rule-set. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s dissolution into cambium retunes the maze from endless repetition to a single, tender echo—“once.” Cost is legible in the blank photographs and the steadying breath that concedes timelessness. No orientation debt; the “day that refused to name itself” is an intentional disorientation that pays off in the final image of unnumbered time.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: arrow→keys→hatch→vault each because/therefore link narrows options and raises cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the same chain that imprisoned becomes the hinge no Collector can lift without apprenticing themselves to seed-craft—social cost legible on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the chain bolted to the bench—shapes every tactic and is re-invested, not discarded, in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the protagonist straps the aid beneath his own auricle and hears the exact contour of paternal retreat, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights every prior absence. Causal chain holds: because he alloys filaments with aurora and the burned promise, therefore the device learns the sonic contour of betrayal; because he accepts its cold kindness, he forecloses revenge and “sets the orchard to grow.” Cost is visible: the whitening hiss of pigment letting go is the moment he pays his father’s betrayal into the machine and takes the loneliness of that knowledge on himself. Orientation is taught by image (frostlight, kelp, ribs of ships) and anchors by line 6; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through final aurora curtain.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the released moonbeams redistribute fate and reconfigure both selves in one image. Causal linkage holds: bouquet warning → recognition → joint ear-to-door → renunciation; cost is legible in “relieved light” and the mother kept alive. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light-theft refractions tightens meaning rather than options. No orientation debt; anchor triad clear by line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thaw-drip/breath-count reweights the stake from solitary craft to communal listening. Closure is a Charged Poise—the three bells and the sign “heat is shared” reconfigure the moral rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 5; drip serves as clock. No loops or teleporting props; bookmark, generator, and ice sheets each evolve causally and return in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage holds: because the cast-plus-shell decodes the hiding place, the narrator gains the film; because the film is already looping overhead, Kellan’s swagger becomes impotent; therefore the floor-trap decision feels inevitable. Closure lands as Charged Poise—projector still whirring, narrator’s voice steadying—so options re-weight without exposition. Orientation anchors (rusted library, first hour after discovery) arrive before 120 words; deliberate starlit disorientation later pays off when constellations become the screen. The only hairline flaw: the ledger’s “purchased silence” is mentioned once and never visualized, so the social cost is slightly conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map becomes a lived set of thresholds, the night acquires “rooms,” and the booklet empties its gold—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: each flake and hush thickens the pattern until the scribe’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet taught by line 3 and paid off in the final image; no later ambiguity. One meaningful tightening—naming the four directional silences—drives the cadence shift that ends the story.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the melted-comma puddle reweights the entire looped premise—time is no longer a punitive reset but a permissive breath. Cost is legible in the sentence “I took that as permission to pause,” where permission = open quota defiance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each loop thickens sensory lint until the violin’s thaw punctures the pattern. Orientation anchor (robot, courtyard, twilight) lands by line 4; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the public projection of doodle-truths reweights the museum’s moral rule-set with undeniable social cost, felt in Rell’s surrendered pass and the narrator’s logged confession. Causal chain holds—lens examination → pattern recognition → public exposure → mutual admission—though escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than sharp. Orientation is lyric-delayed but ultimately functional; lens pattern taught by 25% mark. Cost legible in “I logged my confession” and the resonant hush that now includes spectators.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vine doorway fitting only the narrator’s stoop reconfigures acceptance vs. audit, with conceptual cost (exclusion of the Auditor/hat) legible in the final image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of light-scatter and marble constellations tightens meaning rather than causal plot. Causality is present but subordinate to pattern; the Auditor’s kneel meter-reading forms one micro-turn that validates the graft without resolving it. No orientation debt; maze geography stays trackable through marble breadcrumbs and light pools.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: Hale eases the lever and lets the birds unspool their borrowed minutes—cost is the foreclosed proof he craved. Causality holds: each tweak of the lattice and lever tightens options until he chooses restraint. The sideways-time premise is taught early and paid off in the final image of the nexus thinning into ordinary night.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the program’s stains fade, reweighting the entire premise—ghost instruction is not to be decoded but embodied. The causal chain (watermark → harmonic → cracked bracket → north exit) is tight; each beat tightens options under Causal lens. Cost is legible in the single line “language seemed as clumsy as wet wood,” a persistent constraint that shapes the final silence. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly with conceptual cost: the swallowed truth is physically weighed and publicly spoken, a decisive CR that reconfigures both forecast and conscience. Single-shard structure holds; aurora/grids/graphite callbacks tighten the cadence rather than loosen it. Orientation (who/where/when) arrives within 120 words via metal grate, antennae ribs, siren time—the disorientation of fever is functional, not confusing, so no penalty. The only hairline slip: “oracle” is anthropomorphized (“clicks its relays like teeth”) before its AI nature is anchored, a micro-lag in causality that nudges off perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: confession → maps calls → tunnel → valve → tag/ledger, each because/therefore tightening options. Closure is the Decisive Change: the ledger’s zeros re-price his father’s life; the tag in cheek makes the cost bodily. Orientation anchors within 120 words: “abandoned train tunnel,” “factory ghost shift,” mother’s confession. No lens ambiguity; pattern of rust/schedules taught early; final image (tag as coin) persistent constraint shaping next silence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure reaches for Earned Stasis—tending instead of recording—but the causal chain is missing: we are told “I felt my task deepen” after ceiling crack & swan twitch, yet no decisive action or forfeiture dramatizes the change, so the cost is conceptual only. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but without a visible price the reconfiguration feels ornamental. Orientation holds, yet the single long shard teeters on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure thickens through repeating sonic motifs—hush, tap, bowl hum, vowel—each layer tightening attention rather than causal plot. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“beneath the hush of dreaming roots”). Closure is Charged Poise: the final shared breath under totality reconfigures the silence; no guarantee of permanent voice, but the option of song is now materially shared and irreversible. Visible cost: the therapist’s earlier hedged stance is replaced by audible responsibility; the curl, once inert, is now sonically married to the first syllable—an on-page re-pricing of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (tapestry, diaries, ash) layers sensory sediment until the final inscription releases the walls. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s act of writing converts “bronze quiet” into a bell that can “be rung again,” making the cost the world’s regained ear. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—objects remember him into a new stance—so the required tightening is the moment the dragons’ necks align to dawn, re-weighting all prior grain-dust echoes. No orientation debt; the silo’s geography is carved by sound, not mapped, and that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mosaic pattern is taught by the third shard, the closure is a clear Charged Poise—the beam re-keys the island’s shared secret into song—and the cost is legible in the extinguished wick and Mei’s surrender of the booklet. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each seeded fortune is a dot whose gathered light forces the communal stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the demon recognizes hunger as door, not throne—cost is the relinquishing of omnipotence. Causal linkage holds: each rhetorical loop narrows the entity’s options until grammar itself evicts possession. Orientation is swift; dimensional anchor and dusk chapel are anchored by word 40. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the rule-set with undeniable social cost—questions remain a commons.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the conductor lowers the shell, the spire “holds tones it cannot ring,” and the narrator accepts that the unheard symphony must live without forced breath—cost is the surrender of total control. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each memory-map thickens the sonic texture until silence itself becomes the resolved chord. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet taught by the second sentence; spatial anchors (glass spire, mirrored lake, stair landings) remain coherent. No因果 reversal is required; the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the anti-gravity habit stitches the viaduct into “a single road,” a legible before/after. The causal chain—tablet cadence → procedural maze → fall → stillness—tightens every loop; no shortcut resets. Orientation is taught early: “the glowing viaduct after rain” anchors place/time by line 3; later disorientation inside the maze is paid off when the same stones become “quiet.” Cost is unmistakable in the final image: Lio forfeits omnipotent float for mortal footing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the text builds density around ‘audibly muted’ and the filament of hush until the final Charged Poise reweights silence as feeling. Orientation is swift—cavern, deaf teacher, broken needle all within 120 words. Causality is intact: reverse lullaby → drum response → teacher’s pulse re-ignited. Closure lands with felt cost: the drum pressed to sternum seals restraint with tenderness, mirroring the students’ future listening. Minor slip: the exact moment of decisive change is slightly diffuse across two paragraphs rather than one crystallized image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options (go alone / go with ally / stay silent) are reconfigured in the final breath of the courtyard; cost is the invisible thread now tied to the narrator’s wrist. Causality is accumulative/ textural: each image (tube, hair, gray coat) adds density until the quiet decision to “lean into given lines” becomes inevitable. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by body, fountain, pigeon row, dusk; no spatial drift. No lens ambiguity—pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image of undecided blue.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the violet is timed to release at dusk, therefore the ultraviolet lantern is staged, therefore the memory-smoke is exposed, therefore the broker must decide. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the vial’s oils re-weighted by UV inscription, grief priced as irreversible. Anchors clear by line 4; greenhouse geography tight. UV mechanics are set up early and paid off when glyphs flare; no late rule dumps. Cost is visible: broker loses aromatic shield, weeps on-page. One minor ellipsis: the curator’s shaking hand is mentioned only after the weeping, making the shared impact slightly retroactive rather than simultaneous.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    A Causal-Accumulative hybrid lens holds: each “uncovering” action (rope → mural → poet’s ear) tightens the moral/artistic trade-off until the poem-for-second swap reweights both stakes; closure lands with visible cost—the poet gives up his mapped knowledge and departs “blind” yet salt-rich—satisfying the Decisive Change with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chronic hush is not banished but taught to “listen behind voices,” a felt social cost paid by Mara’s relinquishing control of flawless pitch. Causal chain holds—every storytelling beat is enabled by her prior choice to invite error. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks”) and the pattern is taught early. Persistent constraint: the cracked bell will never sound whole; this limitation shapes the final tactic and image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (amber charge, blotter petal, orris accord) tightens the emotional vise until the final charged poise—her nose trembles, eyes stay open, slate untouched. Cost is legible in the last image: dealer slips the petal into ledger, sealing his own exclusion. Orientation taught at once: “Amber grotto at dusk” anchors who/where/when within 12 words. No causality breaks; static-current conceit stays consistent and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: images (ledger, cocoa, locket, breeze) accrue then re-weight in the closing tableau. Closure = Charged Poise: ledger breathes, options recalibrated, cost legible ("I keep delivering names"). Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: silent contributors remain unseen, a price the narrator now shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pendant’s loop completes the tiled halves of infinity, the cradle sways then stops, and the newborn echo is released—an unmistishable before/after in the city’s acoustic ecology. Causality is tight: every beat from sluice-lift to summit-tank is because/therefore under the borrowed-time rule. The cost is visible in the city’s heartbeat-shift and the future “clumsy pauses” that will repay the theft. The lens (Causal) is taught early and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is CR: “a single fruit of chalk and salt” reprices the entire premise—mathematics becomes taste, solution becomes scaffold. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence slows, stakes deepen, cost is undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors land by line 3. One transition (orchard → exit) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the narrator renounces perpetual invisibility, steps into light, and that choice forecloses the safety of duct-life. Causal linkage holds: every cache move (tape recovery → recorder placement → hair trip-wire) precipitates Mara’s arrival. Sapphire hush & outage anchors are clear inside first 60 words; mosaic pattern (library, pipe-chase, reading room) is taught early and resolves under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final “wait to hear what is needed next,” surrendering control the narrator previously hoarded.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of leaf-landings, moss seams, and storm-blessed channels tightens until the final image reweights mastery into stewardship. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator lifts the leaf, sees spore-passengers, and accepts open-ended transformation; cost is felt in the relinquishing of finish-line control. One causality wobble: gutters overflow and “the street flashed like a creek” but no on-stage consequence (lost stock, angry customer) is shown, softening the tightening. Otherwise every return to the trellis thickens texture and narrows the possible future to “let the leaf decide.”

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the finished mural becomes a living rain-map, reconfiguring the island’s future while the painter’s sleepless nights remain unpaid. Causal chain holds: brooch → rain trail → map → mural, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“after the water wars”) and location cues persist. Cost is legible in the final clause—“teaching us”—where the painter’s private meaning becomes communal tool, foreclosing anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vowel now houses the shadow, the pearl is warmed, and everyday sounds have been irreversibly re-priced—cost is felt in the new weight of the ordinary. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-sequential; the pattern of “listen→translate→house” is taught early and pays off in the final list of domestic words that now chime. One tight transition (pilgrim arrives → vowel ritual) keeps the shard within the two-shard allowance; orientation is anchored by ~100 words. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mended valve releases not a note but “a permission,” reweighting silence from treachery to communal breath; cost is the city’s continuing vulnerability to storms. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “salt and rumor” fragments accretes until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“ivory harbor after rain”); no penalty. One scaffold loop—“we step, we pause, we step”—is pattern-taught and pays off, so exempt from artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fortress dissolves into a platform where sentences walk themselves home. Cost is legible in the ticket’s blank glow and the narrator’s last raised hand. Accumulative lens holds: each offering tightens the hush until the vault brightens. Pattern taught early (cracks → arrows) pays off in the star-map floor that writes back.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s chamber reweights every prior path, the narrator’s private guilt is traded for public bridge, cost is unmistakable (“ash light” in cracked tile). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density climbs through braided star-strands, chalk numerals, whale-bells, and culminates in eyelid-seam opening. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 2, no ambiguity at end. No causality breaks; even lyric images feed the final stake. Persistent constraint—the tile stays as lent bridge—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: curse transfer frees the immortal, spatial corridor appears, cost is felt. Causal chain (coils → fragment speaks → geometry bends → Mara accepts curse) holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words; no ambiguity at end. Lens: Causal, coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because father taught habit-truth, therefore the narrator weaponizes paperwork and routine to outlast cops. Orientation locked by line 3; the single corridor-to-alley scene tightens twice—first when the patrol light “tastes the glass,” then when the shout turns skin to arithmetic. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink pot tilts to streetlight and the city’s ledger recalculates breath vs. indictment. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator forfeits defiance and accepts warnings as “tax,” foreclosing future resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist shelves another sheaf “with gold that smells faintly of lemons and old coins,” crystallizing the perpetual, self-chosen custodianship under Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the flickering lamp, thinning batteries, and the conditional clause “If nobody comes,” forcing the reader to feel the wager. Orientation is taught immediately: who (solitary stationer), where (mountaintop bonsai maze), when (dawn-after-silence). Mosaic shards are limited to two contiguous windows—kiosk interior / maze paths—transitions legible via “Each morning I step…” and “Some afternoons…”, pattern held to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of layered fragments tightens until the poison label and the woman reweight the stake—memory reclaimed through shared listening. Closure is Charged Poise: “together we moved…returning what it gathered” crystallizes options with felt cost of eternal witness. Orientation is taught early—“the harbor remembers me”—so no penalty. One transition (office to rows) is legible; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass turns inward, forgiveness reweights memory with conceptual cost (“altered the past just enough”). Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (shell, cello, chalk, tide) deepens stakes until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. One micro-turn—compass pointing back—tightens rather than reverses, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the slowed drums and rerouted glitter current visibly reconfigure the city’s economic flow while the narrator tastes silt wisdom—legible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: shrimp-mouth socket → path blooms → financiers deflected → clinics flooded. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the tightening is the single cadence shift from spectacle to quiet anchoring. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shutter click forecloses the “second last” and the stained grain becomes a tiny monument whose conceptual cost is legible. Causality is sound—the warmed vial triggers the message exactly as seeded—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural; the deepening is the sky itself turning into product. One micro-drag: orientation (who funds the mirrors?) is slightly late, yet the final image reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the anchor clears the water, the air lightens, and the depot’s magnetic calm becomes the literal atmosphere of the city re-balancing itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: every refracted glimmer, wing-beat ping, and rolling crate tightens the same stake—will Mara’s alternate senses deliver the hull before the tide claims the moment? The cost is the unspoken admission that her world will always require proxy eyes; the reward is that proxy becomes prophecy. The final line “the world answered in kind” re-prices listening itself as civic infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the black pupil under the ice rewrites cartographic logic, and the price is the narrator’s bone-deep chill—“the cold edits our bones.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each condensation map thickens the pattern until the final image reweights all prior rumor. No causality breaks; the falcon’s return is the taught trigger that pays off in the departure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city is not rebuilt by decree but by a shared cadence now lodged in stone and muscle; the cost is the perpetual vigilance the narrator accepts. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each footstep adds a grain of “sand” until the town agrees to be a road; the tuner’s fork is the loom, not the hammer. Orientation is swift—archway, dusk, ghost town by line 3. No meaningful option is foreclosed for any single character, but the collective stance crystallizes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: the narrative layers sensory “particles” of hush until they collapse into a Conceptual Repricing—the vial’s broadcast reframes radios city-wide. The closure unit lands when the protagonist taxes his own breath to keep that fragile bridge intact; cost is visible in the literal O₂ dial turn. Orientation is taught early via the metallic syllables pinging through blue, so the later dissolved coordinates feel earned, not disorienting. No causal cheats—every turn grows from either the net snare or the override of instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: lighthouse, lattice, copperlight, and door-scuff motifs accrue and re-weight at the lantern-pit closure where “air returned” gives Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early (“At dusk…”) and spatial choreography stays coherent; cause is poetic-metonymic rather than strict because/therefore yet remains legible under pattern. No meaningful tightening mid-piece, but cadence shift at beam-division beat delivers the single required deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    A clean Accumulative/Textural lens: the lighthouse plate’s returns (plate → niche → embossed pages) tighten the pattern and reweight the stake from salvage to shared inner light; the closing image of townspeople touching “blind pages” is a Charged Poise that lets the reader feel the new cost—seeing with hands, not eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the rebuilt dial reconfigures time and faith with visible cost (“shadow traveled across us like a hand in blessing”), satisfying CR. Causal chain is present—finding shards → rebuilding → bread timing—but ellipsis between discoveries is lyrical, not motivated, so lens is Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is taught early (“valley…figs…limestone”), so no penalty. One transition (crypt → orchard step) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: chalk color→margin→alias→decoy accumulates into a Charged Poise at the brass slot. Orientation is anchored by line 4; causality is interior but coherent—each chalk revision literally rewrites the envelope’s risk. Closure reweights the premise: the margin itself becomes agent, cost felt in “promise the edges.” Only minor slack: the post-scanner rules are asserted, not tested, so the conceptual cost is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise crystallizes when she resets the orrery—future coups still coming but now mis-timed, cost acknowledged. Causal chain holds: stitch shifts → bell drift → gate yaw, each step because/therefore. Penultimate paragraph does summarize the upcoming apprentices rather than dramatize their changed odds; that softens the Decisive Change edge by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the boat rocks, the letter is relinquished, and the “break in me begins to stitch” under unseen moonlight—cost is felt in the relinquishing. Causal chain holds: shard-drag → condensation message → stepped-into memory → splinter pain → decision to stay; no loopholes or teleporting props. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet taught by line 3 (“mangrove labyrinth”) and pays off when labyrinth folds back around the boat at exit; waiver applies. One tightening beat—hospital doorframe splinter—reweights options; no escalation slippage under lyrical-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the boy’s lip-corner lift confirms the tactic worked, reconfiguring stakes for all parties without a shouted victory. Causality holds because the decrypting labor (mid-scene beat) directly enables the sunrise hand-off plan; the coral show-and-tell seals consent. Cost is legible in “I do not say everything” and the scarf sacrificed to steady plaster—translator’s purity of voice is the price. Lens stays situational: pressure is coherent social triangle, not external explosions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric shards stack like lantern-glass until the closing image reweights the whole. Orientation is taught by line 3 ("bruised pear") and never breaks; each fragment (fresco, reel, jam recipe) returns with added charge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "I had not saved the past; instead I had displayed it long enough to be contagious"—undeniable social cost, felt on page. No causal gaps, no soft resets; fog’s bleach is the only coincidence and it complicates, not rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the narrator accepts perpetual re-waking, a Charged Poise that reweights curiosity over certainty, felt when the coin is left in shadow. Accumulative/lyric lens holds throughout; each echo-deepening beat layers density rather than causal flip, culminating in the final hedge-shaped path. Orientation is taught early (sound-wave garden, cart, console) so no penalty. A hairline slip: the “caption” text is summoned late without prior cue, but it pays off immediately and does not rupture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the smudged ellipsis and pollen-coined “payment” reweight the taxable-thought premise with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds: each garden-coded reply is a because/therefore response to bureaucratic pressure. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of seeded messages taught early and paid off in final vegetal ledger. One causal micro-gap—why collectors retreat—keeps it from 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of blossom warfare → postcard invitation → Spiral Choir lullaby treaty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell exhales, buds hold, insomnia loosens fists—felt cost is the speaker’s perpetual vigilance now redirected toward listening. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4; no disorientation penalty. One meaningful intensification: the postcard’s heat forces public negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open crack, the unfurled name, the orchids ringing under wind—cost is felt in the permanent imperfection she elects to keep. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the hairline deduction is for a 1–2 sentence orientation lag before “opal library above clouds” anchors us.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open door and shared codex reconfigure trust with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the door opens only after vow-braids accumulate—and the ink well’s return threads the dispersed past into the present. A minor orientation wobble: “last year” is the only temporal anchor for the prior collaboration, but the archive’s dust-and-metronome texture teaches the pattern early enough to waive heavier penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final inhalation of the amphitheater crystallizes options—machinery and mercy now share a lung—conceptual cost undeniable. Causal chain holds: resin pattern → chain lengths → gate schedule → valley truce; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by toolkit, notebook, and basalt ribs; no disorientation. Persistent constraint: the breathing stone literally paces every future opening, shaping tactics forever.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pink ticket stub + six bars reweights trust and song, the meteorite’s gravity still in the capsule, cost felt. Causal chain holds: because Ezra brings the melody, therefore the trainer risks Thimble; because Thimble returns, the ledger re-opens. One tight transition (storm → night → return) is legible. No orientation debt; attic, skylight, and pigeons are anchored by line 3. Lens: Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of light-through-holes aligning wood grain to runway threshold crystallizes into Charged Poise with undeniable cost—“the distance steps into me.” Orientation anchored by 120 words; transitions within the drifting terrace are legible. No causality breaks; logbook, cedar frame, and fog-day rule all persist as constraints. Closure lands on-page with felt reconfiguration; persistent price (frame left open) shapes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure deepens through repeated shared breaths and plankton blooms rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—sunrise gold reveals dancers, re-weighting “belonging” with conceptual cost: the narrator now stays, city breathes back. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor slip: generator hiccup is instantly soothed by feather, so no option is foreclosed; hence not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s new “half visible, half song” compromise reweights the premise, felt cost is legible in the narrator’s smudged fingers and shadowed smile. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of seed/glass/cave glow accumulates meaning until the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no ambiguity at closure. One soft spot: the bird’s late arrival introduces an off-page rule tweak, but the cave’s sigh immediately reclaims agency, so causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the chalk grid dissolving into the tide reweights the entire premise—design becomes organism, cost is the erasure of the board itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: every micro-orbit of coin, ribbon, bishop tightens the pattern until the audience’s applause feels inevitable. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“damp stones of the tidal arcade”) and reinforced by sensory tides; no penalty. The final image of “arithmetic of waves” crystallizes both tactic and metaphysics with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clerk’s glove-off, palm-offered beat crystallizes a new harbor “no law can close,” reweighting both their stances under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—the poem’s syllables germinate in the watcher’s doubt beat-by-beat—so the final image of “chosen night” carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught lyrically (who/where seeded by “twilight garden” within first 60 words), so the waived disorientation serves the final star-witness payoff. One hairline slip: the phrase “elective exile” is named twice in authorial summary before it is dramatized, a micro-drag that keeps it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the harbor-master folds the ledger after colors rewrite its debts, and the bay “accepts” the argument. Causality holds: because the glazier stages the light-show, the official’s stance destabilizes; therefore tomorrow’s vote is bendable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of pond rings + light spectra—taught early and paid in the final image of “smiling lips” ripples.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is earned: setting the box beneath the cairn visibly forecloses the old bargain and opens a two-way hinge mission. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; each shard adds density to the guilt/renewal pattern and the final image reweights the stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clean—ridge, night, box—by line 10. No meaningful escalation flaw; one tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “hope equals attention multiplied by exchange” reweights every prior pattern. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of decorations and balloon flights escalates until the gauge becomes town clock. Cost is legible in the narrator’s admission of unlit fear and the weekly commitment to trade failures. One micro-drag: “serene upheaval” is named before it is dramatized, a hairline anticipation of its own effect.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s healed skin and resting tone crystallize the narrator’s new ethic—maps that comfort. Causal linkage intact: grandmother’s experiment setup → narrator’s film use → echo re-charting → corridor exhalation. Legacy’s burden (stake) is visibly repriced: “lighter when I carried it as listening, not law.” Drive lens is Causal; every beat is because/therefore. Cost is on-page: the museum literally exhales the vanished man into peace, narrator’s procedural authority yielded to mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the terrace’s “second city” heartbeat is felt at the parapet, reweighting every prior mirror-glimpse with the cost of shared belief. The causal chain is tight—storm → prism light → painter’s arrival → coded song → mirror opening → communal loan of pulse → bells sever the spell—each because/therefore link narrows possibility toward communal endurance. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: density of refrain (“hush before bells,” “prism parapet after rain”) intensifies until the final image crystallizes the new civic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure = Earned Stasis: negotiator sacrifices voice, clipboard left as material seal; cost legible. Causal lens holds: each ritual step narrows options (“If violence returns, it will snap and I will fall silent”). Orientation clear by line 4; no disorientation penalty. One meaningful tightening: public confession of 27 deaths forces final vow. −0.2 because the planets’ alignment seam is named but never visibly changes tactics or timing on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each image—salt mirror, cracked rivers, ceramic bowl—adds density until the hatchling’s first note reframes the whole basin as resonant chamber. Closure is a Charged Poise: future water rations are foreclosed, the song is already echoing, cost is felt in “promise hurt.” No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Causality intact: manufactured drought → salt flat → chamber discovery → egg placement → echo release. The final rain carrying the earlier song is the conceptual re-pricing that locks the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prisms dim to “instruments not masters,” a conceptual repricing that reframes every prior echo. The cost is legible in the single line “the city shivered” under her unbraiding hand—collective obedience physically cracks. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of ribbon-echoes → courtyard glow → braid-burn → sanctuary inversion, each beat deepening stakes without causal leaps. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3, speculative rule (door between breath) taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dome’s hush, the stick’s scars, and the mirrored “Listen” accrue until the final bar corner re-weights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the trio sit in “easy quiet,” the cost being the permanent relinquishment of authorial dictatorship. Causality holds; no orientation debt—the dome, moth, and stick are anchored within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the collapsed frames return to soil but the memory—and the wind’s literacy—remains charged. Causal chain is light (Accumulative/Textural lens) yet coherent; the moth-wing glass reweights the premise at the end with visible cost. One micro-turn—the monarch’s pause at the broken circle—tightens the cadence without a second reversal, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the aurora-lit lung-opening moment when the first harmonic name rises; cost is palpable in the scar, the spent lamp, and the lifelong stay the narrator accepts. Orientation is anchored by line 4; transitions are legible under a single scene; no causality breaks; pattern of card→rope→bronze is taught early and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chosen path becomes mutual, crystallised in the communal heel-print in mud with the felt cost of leaving the bunker behind. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust air, snail arithmetic, lichen consoles) thickens until the final braid reweights the premise. Orientation is quickly anchored (bunker exterior, storm coming). The only minor drag is the early dream exposition (“Each dream mapped…”) which lightly stalls momentum before the door opens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: the mirrored ash reconfigures the palace and the self into a ledger that now costs eternal vigilance; the covenant’s price is undeniably felt. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each detail of dust, torch, mica, mortar accretes until the ceiling arrow and bronze eyelid crystallize meaning. Causality remains intact: tile→arrow→eyelid→ash-mirror sequence is irreversible and stakes foreclose retreat. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and tightened by mortar spark at ~450 words.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each repetition of silence, dust-braids, and broken teeth layers pressure until the final quiet image reweights the premise. The 120-word orientation anchor is met (“soundless sanctuary…”) and the braided-river dust map at closure pays off the early pattern. One因果 hiccup: the sanctuary’s rule-set (“reappears when needed”) is asserted, never constrained; luckily it complicates rather than resolves, so the waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise—options narrowed, cost legible in Mara’s soundless laugh—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored returns (twilight frost, glass mountains, breathing cadence) tightens once when Iren turns mirrors outward and offers the scarred index—an irreversible gesture that reweights the stake from capture to co-creation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard rings, paths unroll, boundaries erased, cost legible in the broken sextant’s new uselessness for stargazing. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“At the center stood Iren…”). No causality breaks; fog corridors and shard frames track spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the ribbon darkens with water, the leak is taught to “speak,” and the protagonist walks away having foreclosed payment for wisdom. Causal linkage holds throughout—because the guild breached, the mender enters; because the pipe weeps, the ribbon is sacrificed. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed in the first 30 words. The receipt-map hand-off is a Decisive Change that reconfigures the kids’ agency and crystallizes the “seasonal handshake” without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell becomes a map of pollination, not a face, which reweights inheritance from identity-transfer to mutual breath. Cost is legible in the instant the ledger pages *loosen* and the woman laughs—his choice forfeits the safety of linear ancestry. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: pollen, breath, pages accumulate until the final cadence re-tunes the stakes. Orientation is taught by line 7; no ambiguity, no causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the index stamps the fern-print into her palm, trading her right to forget for the mountain’s future claim—cost felt in the ache that “vibrates anyway.” Causal chain holds throughout: because she researches the traveler’s gap, she edits the silence, rewrites his apology, and pays with memory. The lens stays causal-tight; no teleporting props or unearned knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the door within fog widens, crystallizing that the price for keeping the names is perpetual drift—trapped freedom—paid on the page (“We left the ship… unmoored yet guided”). Causal chain holds: emerald card → hinge consent → twin externalized → garden activation → departure with seeds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and hold. Memory-as-clock tightens once (“as memories alter” sign flip) and narrows options without forcing causal gymnastics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s “clarified hour” re-weights the absent week and relaxes the vellum, cost felt in the dust path and the door’s disappearance. Causal linkage holds—each gear-check and braid-pull tightens options toward the single ring. A hairline slip: the diplomat’s seal is revealed as map rather than earned discovery, slightly diluting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “readiness” path is not traversed but crystallized, reweighting the premise that maps are imposed rather than co-authored. Cost is legible in the final image—storms bowing—an undeniable conceptual price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: ripple-marks, hush-bloom, drum-chords densify until meaning pivots without causal reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at the end when the cave “maps us.”

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the green flare answer re-weights coincidences into communion, cost felt in the swallowed-pulse risk of inviting unknown survivors. Lens is Causal: every star-path adjustment and resin tweak is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“Kera listened”). Persistent constraint—mended prism still fragile—shapes final tactics and image. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in final beam sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of weathered images mounts until the final conceptual repricing—“identity is the pattern that remains when giving has been practiced to clarity.” Cost is legible in the release of glitter that “once was breath.” One clean transition (observatory → forecourt) is taught by spatial alignment; pattern is coherent, closure charged.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent bouquet opens “like a hand, steadying the night,” reconfiguring hope without promising stars—cost is the admitted un-returned cousin and the town’s fragile new cadence. Causality is lyric-Accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the mosaic pattern teaches the reader early and the final hush obeys it. Orientation is clear by line 5 (“blooming fortress at dusk”), waiving any penalty. One could wish for a more concrete constraint that back-fires on Lio, but the atmospheric ledger holds.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the refusal to decide tonight crystallizes options with visible cost—the relationship remains suspended, tide still rising. Tangential approach is named, demonstrated, and paid off in the final deferral; lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “sideways listening” holds. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Cost is felt but could be sharper if the deferral altered immediate tactics beyond speech; slight under-crank keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each silence pour thickens the texture until the final alloy reweights the past. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fused quiet is corked, the ladder widens, cost is felt in the image of “storms arrive” where these silences will be spent. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Every evening when gravity inverts”)—no penalty. Pattern of three pours teaches escalation early; no reversals needed under this lens. Minor slip: “stretching contracted, elastic as sleep” momentarily fuzzes temporal clarity but serves the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gondola lingers mid-air, cables humming a new key, re-weighting silence from intimidating to companionable. Cost is legible in the operator’s forfeited schedule and the mother’s spoken name released into wires. Causal chain holds: bell → meter spike → wind adjustment → vial clearing → mother’s exhale. Orientation is anchored by 120 words via “terrace beneath my gondola lines drifted” and the whistle echo clock.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the throne equals a rain-radio that demands listening, not ruling—cost is the lifelong burden of stewardship announced in one image. Causal lattice holds: flake warmth → mural arrow → root coordinates → platform stairs → rain-radio; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Sunrise deadline is live on the leaf; the orchard’s clipped-tape voice is the final causal nudge that forces ascent. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 15.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the visitor leaves breathing, Keeper stays to “mark the safe embers with stars.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image (ash, ring, salt-dust) accretes until the final reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable—“the loaded emptiness stayed, but now it carried a pulse I did not have to supply alone.” Transitions are legible; mosaic shards are taught early and resolve under one atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the quantum promise spoken under pressure literally seeds a diamond that remembers every speaker, making “gentle hard things” the new currency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mushroom-light, gasket affection, and parallel texts accumulate into a pattern break that reweights value itself. Causality is intact—each text, pulse of glow, and turn of the bolt tightens the stake until the chamber sings. Cost is palpable in the bead’s creation and the protagonist’s renewed indenture to “workers fund,” not abstract salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “listening” reweights the entire premise of royalty and responsibility. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—standing-wave pattern teaches early, density increases, and the lattice-stitch cadence reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the moment he closes the portrait and accepts non-sovereign vocation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught within 40 words and waiver the disorientation test.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s lens clicks into a new alignment, the knight sheds armor, and the floating pear crystallizes the cost of choosing possibility over service. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern, not plot—so the “forgotten patterns” act as the single tightening; the vellum map and blueprint drink the night, making the shift legible. The 9+ gate is missed only because the cost is felt more than articulated in a single, irreducible image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, thumb-smudges, and string knots build texture that reweights the stake—archivist’s need to honor micro-kindnesses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mailed envelope crystallizes options (possible dismissal, possible warmth for Rowan) with undeniable conceptual cost. Cost is legible in “letter, I explain that I keep watch… sometimes the unknown can be tender when examined”—a confession of policy breach. No orientation debt; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is a therefore linkage—puddle map leads to hatch, key disables lights, relay spill reappears the erased. Closure is a CR: the lagoon’s gold reweights history itself, undeniable social cost on-page. Persistent constraint—the exposed relay—shapes the final escape. No teleporting props or amnesia; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 10 and again after hatch exit.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each lyric return of drip/echo/code tightens the sonic net until negative-space silence ruptures it. Orientation of who/where/when is immediate (“I came before dawn…path led down”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—silence frame holds prophecy at measurable cost (“the prophecy will nap…my whisper will ride the fog back”). Cost is legible: he forfeits renown to carry “the empty frame home.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each leaf-arch adds density until the pattern breaks with the moonstone flare, re-weighting order→release. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor lifts, villages stay suspended, Fen’s hearing widens—cost legible in emptied pockets. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by whale-arbor in line 1. Causality is poetic but traceable: misread→tilt→catastrophe averted only by letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: fire → sigil → errand-follow → greenhouse grate → cavern machine → wire-bridge → municipal map flicker. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options (the compass refuses north, mandates vault). Closure is Decisive Change with cost: he cedes certainty, mounts charred ribs in shop, accepts customers on algal time. No teleporting props; urn, wire, socket all pre-seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rain-drinking disc reweights “redemption” from miracle to witnessed seam, cost made visceral in the father’s future hatred. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of anneal-hammer-inlay tightens meaning each cycle until the final gleam. Orientation is complete in four sentences; transitions are legible within the single continuous scene. No causality break, no loops; the only beat that could feel resolved by luck (rain timing) is instead staged as atmospheric confirmation rather than causal saviour.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laugh steps into shared oxygen, reweighting guilt into liveable ache—cost is the unveiled memory of the refused rescue. Causal chain holds: detune → seams open → confession → laugh approaches → new gait agreed. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“echo gorge… throat of stone”). No lens ambiguity; pattern of sour-note-as-key taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of UV-lit re-entries (forest→pool→return) tightens via sensory density, not causal reversals. Closure is Charged Poise—strap left as boundary condition, “ordinary dark” ahead—conceptual cost legible: the equation stays unsolved, the forest keeps the proof. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“ultraviolet forest”), no lens ambiguity; one shard with seamless time flow.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the market physically lowers its ladders after the names are spoken, a legible before/after image that reweights the city’s relationship to its own past. Causality is accumulative-textural: the refracted harbors accumulate until the naming ritual crystallizes meaning; the cost is conceptual—the city must now carry its erased labor—rather than a private loss to the narrator. Orientation is taught early ("alchemist's market strung high above city rooftops") and anchors hold; the final image of "tide within a tide" circles back, satisfying the lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: exposing the ceiling grift reweights the circus’s moral rule-set and the narrator’s vocation. Causal chain is intact—barrel → hatch → mirrors → expose—though the ghosts’ stakes are declared not tested. Cost is implicit but legible: the booth can no longer sell its lie. Meets 9+ quick test for closure with cost; lens is Accumulative, held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard remaps itself, eternity bends for a heartbeat, and the narrator pays with new silence—cost is on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through frost, glass, and breath until a cadence shift reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“glass orchard library floats”) and disorientation is taught early, so no penalty. Causality holds: because he failed once, he now risks the orchard’s buoyancy.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city becomes “open conservatory” and Neris’s stasis—returning to drape the last mirror—carries felt cost of permanent ache. Causal lens holds: shard demonstration → vote → judge’s ruling because/therefore chain. Orientation is taught early (“We live after time becomes visible… baroque asteroid”) so disorientation is waived; corridor geography stays trackable. One tightening only, but it reweights civilization’s meaning under coherent rule of visible time.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the drum tether sings harmless knots, daylight is laid down as bread, and both factions listen—options reconfigured with conceptual cost (rust oath amended, dawn conditional). Causal linkage holds throughout: because he wilts near lies → he demands honesty from elders → their admission steadies him → chip warmed → tether played → hinge mended → constable’s power unspools. One shard transition (threshold → midnight town → return) is legible by 25 %, pattern taught by sonic keyhole logic. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 40; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: density of hush, rain, scent escalates to the charged final image. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial of paradox-petrichor + footprints that “hold a little shine” reconfigure the collector’s world without exposition. Cost is conceptual—the secret now lives inside the village’s lungs. One soft spot: the hinge-door opens via a hum, a causality blip, but the pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric density crests into a resonant reconfiguration—lantern slide’s final projection turns arch from threat to gate. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the new map demands perpetual improvisation, no return to GPS certainty. Orientation clear by line 6; no penalty. Causality is associative rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—postcards as refractive keys, paint withheld—and each seasonal shard adds density until the final “tender shadow” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pavilion image reconfigures the premise from seeking knowledge to offering color without coercion. Cost is legible in the erased snow, the exhausted postcards, and the narrator’s readiness to paint “without asking for permission.” A hairline slip: the causal link between moon-angle and interior insight is lyric rather than strictly legible, keeping it shy of 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary folds open like a throat, reweighting righteousness with complicity; cost is the humming past that will keep hurting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of debris/mirror cipher taught early, density tightens once the lagoon double is grasped, and cadence shifts to crystalline confession at the end. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are inside 120 words; deliberate disorientation (retrocognition) is paid off by the mirrored lagoon moment. No causality breaks; the final image of “pinprick confessions” makes the conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the unopenable bottle reframes from failed vessel to disciplined lens, making the new civilization conceivable. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each lantern-projection tightens the possibility of civic return, ending in a charged poise where silence equals vow. Cost is palpable in the erased chalk and unopening bottle—effort without release. Lens stays legible; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by writing the prophecy as witness rather than sealant, the narrator revalues the oath archive from binding contract to living, open wound; the cost is the certainty that he will be the blade. Causal chain intact—immersing the shaving → tree speaks in Hittite → prophecy confirmed → choice made. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of grooves, salt-grief texture, and bark consonants tighten until the final inscription reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cap’s weightlessness reweights “vortex inheritance” from burden to choreography, cost felt in the lighter palm. Causal linkage holds throughout—oak cap → song → entropy drop → door sigh—without convenient amnesia. Orientation is taught by line 6 (icebound atrium, cracked dome, starlight), well before 120-word mark. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each spiral image thickens pattern until the final cadence shift unlocks meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    A single causal arc—glue dries → wind signs → switch to standby—lands a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s safety is re-priced through silence, not sirens; the lens is causal throughout, no teleporting props, and the zero-hour tension tightens options until the final image reconfigures the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky’s rush reconfigures the station’s fate and the crew’s stance, with the lantern glass passed hand-to-hand as visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the meteor shower’s density shift reweights the stake—and the pattern holds cleanly. One minor causality wobble: the decommission notice arrives off-stage and the crew’s instant conversion is slightly convenient, but the final image crystallizes options without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ellipse of breath/dust re-threads the covenant, the box now a portable heart whose weight forecloses return home. Accumulative lens holds: each elemental image (hive, pane, ghost-veil) accretes until the final hush reweights meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—“the hives clicked yes.”

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon settles, the capsule heals, and the narrator commits to stewardship-by-touch; the cost is the surrender of borrowed heartbeats, felt in the image of coins trembling free. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the kite’s new “honest tail” reweights the premise—imperfection becomes instrument, not flaw—visible in the boy’s louder whoop and the father’s surprise-gratitude. Causal chain intact: snapped string → feather gift → re-launch → reweighted beauty rule; cost is the poet’s surrender of his own quill, a concrete forfeiture. Lens holds accumulative: pattern of “weave” repeats, density increases, final image crystallizes meaning without expository nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    A lyrical-causal track: every beat is because/therefore rooted in caretaker agency (spiral growth → door opens). Orientation is secured by 80-word mark; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ritual stance crystallizes with conceptual cost: “one species at a time, unafraid.” Wire, diary, pillar converge in earned image that forecloses retreat; no slip or cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and maintained: every footprint/vial/bell swing layers density toward the resin-to-stone-to-eight ratio that “balances homecoming by travel.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tower’s hush is newly roofed by shared attention—visible when narrator tucks the amber away and steps into a “rinsed world.” No causal reversals are required under this lens; the meaningful tightening is the final data convergence whose cost is the surrender of lab-bench certainty. Orientation and motivation are anchored within the first 120 words; only a hairline slip of late-introduced bell-rope keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared and maintained: each bird-call translation adds density until the soil grammar crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the veteran’s tear and the gull’s comic approval lock the submerged concord into the living shore without exposition. Cost is legible in the scent that “fells him to quiet tears” and in the jetty’s new load of roots. Pattern taught early (bird=map, pod=word) and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the settlement’s shared water reweights “distance into closeness” with undeniable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each salvaged object layers density until the amber + phonograph re-tunes the world. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4 (“cracked wasteland… wind-rattled cathedral of rust”) and pays off at closure. No causal breaks; the river’s groan is set up by counter-turn spindle and leaf-filtered light.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dome’s “song” reweights the shutdown from failure to migration path, and the cost is the narrator’s permanent exile, felt in the cooling paper. Causal chain holds—sketch smear → vector → bedrock frequency → pattern sent—each because/therefore link tightening options. The orientation anchor arrives by word 60; no debt applied. One minor loop: “echoed silence” is repeated verbatim; does not touches the final image, so −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sky stays wrong but is now “our wrongness,” a conceptual repricing paid for with the teacher’s scroll and Kestrel’s driftwood-knight confession; the causal chain of chess-for-secrets → amended covenant → flexible sky holds without gaps, and the price is legible in the cathedral sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final nod reweights authority from spectacle to small-gesture stewardship under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each walking-spelled word accumulates voices into a braid the narrator can touch, shifting agency from passive witness to active archivist. Orientation anchors by line 4 (“old whispering gallery,” “interregnum”). Cost is visible in the coiling of the red cord and theCustodian’s palm-map of calluses—“HOME” spelled in scar-tissue—making renunciation palpable. No late-rule changes; pattern taught early; lens stable to last breath.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single accumulative/textural scene is taught immediately: the mountain-bookstore is a living palimpsest whose aisles “braid and unbraid.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of a palm-shaped room re-weights “home” from noun to practice, paid for with an exhalation that is both gift and forfeiture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but serve the final reconfiguration, so the Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mended thread tightens the ambient hush until the final knot reweights the entire tapestry. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—crows shred sky, time resumes—cost is felt in the empty palm. Orientation, causality, and pattern are taught by 120 words and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders’ single-story rule collapses under the refracted chorus, felt cost visible when torchlight fractures over the spire. Accumulative lens holds: each nightly poem adds a shard until meaning is irreversibly braided. Orientation is taught early through “towers of bone” and the mist-blade spire, so the deliberate disorientation serves closure; waiver applies, no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the molten charm becomes the golden seam that lets the wheel turn—cost is the lost talisman itself. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (statue pockmarks → gear ratios) is taught by 25 % and reweights meaning at the end. One orientation wobble—late naming of the “stormwheel” could have come sooner—but the acid-sea logic holds without retro-patching. The final image (warm plate against forehead) crystallizes the before/after: broken self re-accepted, workshop adrift but alive.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the painted shell floats, the cave nods, and the protagonist accepts erasure as the price of “temporary eternity.” The causal chain (cracked mirror → deadline fear → cave quest → canvas relinquished) is tight; every beat links because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“rented room above the quay”) and the wrong-turn mechanics are taught early enough to payoff at the hidden oasis. Cost is unmistakable: he physically signs the canvas with salt water and walks away, foreclosing possession.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the skiff’s slow turn reconfigures possibility and the beam’s low angle embodies the cost of withheld sound. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, cork-scent, dawn milk) tightens stakes until the final image reweights them. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks. The price is legible in the softened metal rail and Alder’s grudging mirrored hands.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dish holds steady, Rowan’s feet hit shells, and the network of absence becomes passable—cost is felt in the navigator’s exhausted slump. Causal chain intact: failed hydraulics → censer counterweight → bearing sent → convoy arrives. One minor orientation lag: “the river ran inland” is never spatially anchored, but the lyric pattern teaches disorientation that closure repurposes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the eye is relinquished, the circle must now “practice gentler speech unaided,” and the persistent constraint (empathy virus) remains—cost is unmistakable in the final image of “fractured grace like cables after weather.” Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each meeting’s softening is logged, pressure mounts when the courier reclaims contraband, so the burial choice is the cumulative answer. Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. One minor loop—“because I am rational, because the world deserves…”—does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper’s lamps signals re-weight his own exile and the lovers’ separation in one image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—gaps, salt outlines, flower, light-pauses accumulate until the final deck-side echo. Causality is interior but legible: because the keeper trusts absence, he can read the silenced name and elect to keep sending absence outward. Cost is unmistakable: “I returned…feeling like a witness who lives in the margins.”

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (ants, chip, maps, creek) layers density until the cavern press crystallizes choice. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the word lonely no longer fit the room” reconfigures meaning with felt cost—he forfeits drift-life for civic tether. Persistent constraint—the chip and the promise—shape every tactic. Cost is legible in the final line where tomorrow’s labor is already weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the circlet surrender converts bleeding starlight into a “patient mirror,” reweighting her rule and the world’s wound.

Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and are repeatedly refreshed; no penalty. Final image exhales “a breath that would not cost a body,” undeniable social/ontological cost made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s felt weight recalibrates under the new coefficient. The cost is visible—the laughing pebble halts at the drain, foreclosing prior evanescence. Causal chain (drops → spiral → compression) remains transparent under lyric compression. Orientation fixed by line 4; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: every ring of the scroll, stuttering clock, and returned hawk image thickens the same stake—how to carry time honestly. Closure lands with undeniable cost when the narrator seals the door, letting the scroll “rattle softly,” a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses eternal return. Orientation is taught by scent and grave within 60 words; transitions from waking to dream and back are cleanly marked by table/scroll/cabin anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the screw remains, the bone pin is added, water speaks “like forgiveness that remembers the work ahead.” The cost—accepting flawed time, mid-wife’s grief, narrator’s permanent sensory loss—is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of water-drops, breath-fog, and quiet hand-moves thickens until the cadence shift at the final line (“tiny applause shaped like water meeting time”). No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) clear within first 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (steam film, frost, hinge rune) thickens until the final image reweights the premise—stories become portable, scars become shoreline. Closure lands as Charged Poise: bronze tea islands reflect new buoyancy; cost is felt in the held-breath ache and the quill that “wants to carry.” No orientation drift; anchors arrive by line 5. Persistent constraint—the held breath—shapes every tactical pause.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bottle holds the orchard’s last breath, re-weighting the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of scent-paper-current intensifies until the final image re-tunes damage. Orientation is taught early (“sheet music archive,” “orchard held its breath”). No因果 breaks; every beat adds density or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s spiral slows and the illusion folds into the communal definition, cost felt in the narrator’s outward breath that becomes the door. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each circle tightens the braid of revisions until meaning dew condenses on the dictionary page. Orientation is taught early (“the ancient temple library lost in time”) so the waiver applies; causality is internal and coherent. A hairline slip: “history eased around the dais” is slightly abstract, keeping the score shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam stabilizes, the station “sang by counting absence,” and the narrator pockets the key—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the easier path of blaming the clocks. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each hydraulic detail and backward count thickens pattern until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Causality remains coherent; no orientation debt. Cost is unmistakable in the final “small hearth against the wet.”

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator releases the button, re-tuning the farm’s sensors from fortress to conversation. Causal linkage holds—every beat flows from intrusion alert → permeable pursuit → consent pulse → network calm. Cost is felt in the narrator’s relinquished control and the farm’s new, precarious openness. Lens is accumulative/textural; pattern taught early and paid off in the final image of morning arriving “from within.”

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each map annotation increases pattern density until the father’s handwriting detonates a tightening that fuses archive, city, and ward. Closure—lantern light bridging bedsides—earns Charged Poise: options re-weighted, no reset, felt cost in wince-and-sip. Causality maintained by continuous object (lantern) and micro-choices; orientation immaculate inside 120 words. Pattern taught early (adopting lantern), paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final loop opens “into a road” while the operator stays behind, cost felt in self-erasure; the accumulative pattern (widow, baker, drummer/spouse) tightens stakes under a lyrical lens taught early; causal links are elliptical yet coherent, satisfying short-form RR.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ledger bruise, the locket pressed into wet ink, and the tide’s inhale reconfigure the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens is taught by the repeating “between breaths” motif and lands when the sea gives/takes the jetty edge. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (jetty pylons, ferryman’s boots) are clear within the first 120 words. The final image—“the sea gives it again”—makes the stake legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the rock becomes a communal listening shrine, loneliness is re-priced as shared attention, and Mara’s own isolation remains uncured—cost is felt. Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor density increases until the timetable-free queue forms; no causal cheats. Orientation is swift; ivy, station, flood, and jars anchor by line 5. One minor bobble: the “moment when the story changes” is declared rather than dramatized, but the image of fingerprints on the counter immediately reweights stakes, satisfying the CR beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sap-and-echo density increases until the grove forms a "nave," then cadence shifts to breath-held quiet; closure is Charged Poise—ring grooves now aligned to "poise" not place—conceptual cost legible in final image. Causality intact: each sensory absorption beat tightens stakes until the grove crystallizes the stillpoint; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by line 4 ("ultrasonic forest") and reinforced through body-in-environment choreography; disorientation is taught and pays off at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rewritten nine sits beside the one, docking spine “adjusts by a hair,” and frozen beads become moons—a legible reconfiguration of meaning and risk. The causal chain is tight: wrong seed → bent spine → coolant spill; manual micro-repair → partial re-align; cost is felt in the station’s breath and the “blanket woven from echoes.” Lens is Causal with clean because/therefore, no ambiguity at end. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive with first paragraph and hold.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the empty camera click reweights the entire premise—absence now “contains the whole harbor breathing.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each signed phrase thickens silence until the bay literally retunes. Orientation is taught lyrically within 120 words; disorientation serves the payoff. Persistent constraint: the camera’s hollowness shapes every tactic and the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage holds: each art-piece clue is both trail and test, so the archive arrival feels earned. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the jar of drowned matches reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One slight wobble: the “breathing archive” metaphor is introduced late and could have been seeded earlier to tighten orientation; still, the final image reconfigures stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of carrying “auroral sorrow like a lantern” reweights the stake and confirms the cost of shared dream coherence. Causal chain holds: drumming → garden response → memory overlap → consent → blurred outline; each step tightens options. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (“clinic lake,” “security drones drifted like drowsy moths”) so disorientation serves the dream-logic rather than confusing. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout; pattern of sound → bloom → memory is legible at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: storm → radio fail → Otero’s wager → courier lost → whisper-guided rescue. Each beat tightens options (no radios, dawn deadline) and the maintenance vents act as persistent constraints that shape tactics. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the maze keeps his whisper, he keeps their walks—mutual imprint with conceptual cost legible in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: ripples, shutters, star-dots accrue until the brother surfaces. Orientation locked by line 3; space tracked cleanly. Closure is a Charged Poise—the city "lighter by one lesson," the guardian walking off with mirror ticking against ribs; cost is the perpetual burden of quiet. One scaffold spot: “they call me…” could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the councilwoman’s hesitation outside the grotto reweights the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—“second thoughts spread like fungi.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned window displays tighten the civic mood until stance crystallizes. Causality stays intact: each display beats adds social pressure without a causal speech. The only drag is a mild orientation debt: “cobalt library in mist” arrives before we know it is a library, but the image later pays off, so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the island’s refusal of ownership and the pier’s loosened bolts reweight the premise with social cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the scrimshaw’s mother-whale guilt and the whale-call pattern are taught early and return to charge the ending, satisfying the lens. Minor orientation slip: “sublittoral fringe” and eddy/crane imagery arrive before spatial anchor, but the lyric pattern justifies the waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the remade hush is charged with the cost of permanent outsider status. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of narrated chores tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is swift; turbines and farmhouse root us by line 3. One hairline slip: inspector’s “compliance” line could carry sharper cost to the performer.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the quartz colonnade’s tone drops from cathedral to throat, the ice reconsiders itself, and “we changed the world by listening” reframes the ban. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; atrium, lake, and poet are placed. No meaningful cost is dramatized inside the poet—his body, notebook, or reputation remain untouched—so the conceptual price, while legible, lacks a felt personal tariff that would lift this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mosaic shards (phoenix failure → reed insertion → child’s prism) braid cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens; each addition reweights “awakening” until the final chorus of cracked glass singing. Transitions are legible via repeated plant-signaling motif, and closure lands in a Charged Poise: the courtyard now practices imperfection aloud. Orientation is complete by line 4; no因果关系 breaks, and the persistent constraint of Mara’s silence keeps cost visible. Minor cap: the traveler’s boat loss is told not dramatized, a hairline slip that prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist forecloses the path of priestly certainty, accepting the modest cost of anonymity while the mined light pours a quiet crown over the crowd—image makes the conceptual reprice unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: because/therefore chains are soft, but density of refracted light→sound→footsteps tightens until the hallway itself becomes a current. Orientation is taught lyrically—“golden shadows pool”—and pays off in the final amber rim. One transition (lab→street) is legible; pattern of stations is established by 25 % mark.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the genuinely artificial stars re-price grief from wound to medium. “Tending is the bravest spark I know” crystallizes the new rule-set—care as illumination—after the locket corridor has already foreclosed retreat. Cost is unmistakable: he will relive his own bottom each dawn, planting lockets that outlive him. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density crescendos until the final image braids patience into dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration—rain, steam, and shared breath crystallize the lattice—yet the cost is collective and diffuse, not protagonist-bound. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern deepens rather than causally tightens. Orientation is swift, but the loft’s spatial logic (pin placement, walking order) stays slightly fuzzy. Closure image is resonant, yet the Decisive Change happens off-page in the arriving neighbors rather than in the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is cleanly earned: the release of the purified cages into the public chamber is a Decisive Change that reconfigures both the pagoda and her self-definition; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught by irregular step-sequences and crystalline returns holds without contradiction, and the final image of twilight reframes the whole drive.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the act of grafting stone into living shelf re-weights the library’s rule-set—shadows can become spines, grief can be shelved as bloom. Cost is legible in the final image: the keeper’s palms still warm, the western window now hosting a book that can never be checked out, custody forever billed. Causality holds: each prior beat—catalog chime, reel comparison, stone warming—feeds directly into this irreversible inscription. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of pollen, letters, and warmth accrues until the cadence shifts into root and bark.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the con collapses, therefore the sanctuary’s bones speak; because Karim confesses, therefore the narrator rewrites the future contract. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chameleon’s tail tip pressed “as if blessing a promise not to lie anymore” reweights every prior talisman lie with undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“tonight the chameleon slept”), well under the 120-word window. Persistent constraint: the rebuilt branch lattice and the kept empty vial lock the promise into physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each image (hourglass snow, ivy hum, elm sap) layers density until the final reconfiguration—miracle reclaimed but the wound left open—lands with visible conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate: single POV, tower room, post-surgery dawn, all inside 60 words. Causality is poetic but coherent: because the miracle slipped into greenery, the narrator must descend and trade a new cut for its return; the coffee-ring reading motivates the descent and pays off in the closing line. Closure occurs on-page in the crystallized image of a book-scar that stays intact while turned—Charged Poise with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (“I am the crystal gazer…”) and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the blank leader glowing like mercy visibly reweights the premise, showing that unused love resides in the never-projected clear seconds. Causality is interior and symbolic rather than sequential; the lens holds. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~80 words. The only minor drag is that the final beat is narrated rather than dramatized—the manager nods, envelope warms—but the reconfiguration is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative lens: the final image of the narrator bowing while the aurora keeps the archway lit re-weights meaning with conceptual cost—mapping the unmeasurable leaves a “thin line of cold” inside. Orientation is anchored by word 30; causality is lyric, not because/thereor, but pattern-taught early via “unwritten calendar” and paid off in the last line, satisfying lens clarity. One meaningful tightening occurs when sparks become syllables that open the fledglings’ eyes; however, the prior beats are more tableau than escalating pressure under a single dominant stake, preventing 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frozen clock and scattered embers reweight the world’s depleted logic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image thickens the same stake of salvaged futurity—and the final image makes the cost undeniable (“a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive”). Orientation is taught early by lyric dislocation, waived at close.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror shows the frontier as self-imposed cage; chewing the gear reweights the entire quest from search to self-consumption, cost legible in the oil-taste on tongue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each metallic tree timbre layers until the chord bridge forms, tightening knowledge rather than causal plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when the tower’s throat lifts the narrator. No telegraphing or amnesia; every sleep-jump is a patterned beat that accrues toward the final tonal chord.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: pattern of star stamps and indirect paths reweights arrival. Closure lands in the quiet constellation card—conceptual repricing carries felt cost of relinquished chase. Orientation drifts early: “the path refuses to hold still” teaches disorientation, but who/where stays hazy past 120 words; waiver applies, so no penalty. No causal break, but escalation is tonal, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the half-turn keeps the hinge ready, reconfiguring silence from absolute to conditional. The causal chain is present—bolt refusal → potential future sound—but the “because” linking this act to any tangible risk to the inhabitants is inferred rather than demonstrated; stakes lean on metaphor (“storms upon everyone”) instead of on-page jeopardy. Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; pressure deepens through imagery recurrence rather than option-narrowing turns.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the pretender’s title is publicly sundered, the ledger’s minnows snap into bones, and the false signet dissolves—cost is legible in the flaking salt image. Causal chain holds: cryptic messages → faithful assembly → counter-reading of genealogies → corridor opens → ledger confrontation → title line. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate early disorientation ("dust moved like thoughtful constellations") is taught and pays off when the library reconfigures at climax. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of ink, dust, and drift rune reweights stakes until the final image reprices legitimacy itself.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moon’s 18-year nodal swell rewrites the path, charging every prior measurement with new contingency. Causal lens holds: each tapping session → data → re-charted Trace; lunar周期长 drives final stance. Accumulation pattern taught early by marginalia “nodes?” and paid off when atlas page sleeve becomes living beacon. Cost is undeniable: “we swear to cross… in listening” forecloses old innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry’s gentle startup reconfigures the bay’s silence into covenant, cost paid in the speaker’s wiped-oil “war paint” and the visible foreclosing of stealth. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each braided wire, crank turn, and whispered reply layers until the coil accepts the dolmen hum. Orientation is swift—“edge of the abandoned spaceport repair bay, in the margin of daylight” anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the translucent frond glows over scaffolds, reweighting “implanted destiny” to invited destiny with felt civic cost. Causal lattice holds—kite-code → heat ritual → kernel consent—each step forecloses the council’s museum plan without reset. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: the broken watch and reed songs keep time, shaping every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: relocating the dedication into the glasshouse visibly forecloses the board’s dramatic vista while accepting rain-stitched reality; cost is felt in chair’s scowl and soaked overlook. Causal chain (storm threat → freeze response → bench move → photograph placed in niche) holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. One strong tightening suffices for short form; lens is Causal, held to last image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the released shutter-beam re-lights her vocation; cost is the tacit acceptance that every portrait will carry fracture. Causal chain holds—untangle rope → free lens → internal window lifts—though the “descent into darkness” motive is stated early and never tested in a beat of real hazard.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “I confirm the rule” reweights the entire premise with the felt cost of survivable splinters. The causal chain—drone maps attention → ink gate opens → tracker enters widened second → braces beam → carries rule back—is clean, and the lens (Causal) holds. Persistent constraint: every future crisis will demand communal breath-holding or lethal haste. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“wind-carved encampment”), waiving any anchor debt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the letter still moving, the city’s grammar thawing, the narrator’s name inserted like a fuse that may yet burn. Cost is undeniable in the image of morning arriving “without permission.” Causal chain holds: thaw → read → encrypt → send → silence reciprocated. Orientation is taught by the dome-glass and snow-muffled echo within 40 words; disorientation is functional, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“patterns break themselves”) and held: each lyrical repetition thickens the sonic texture until the final sealing of hush. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the jar of hush is lifted, the sky re-stitches, and the fisher drifts onward—cost is conceptual (garden rifled, constellations appeased) rather than personal, but it is undeniably legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately dream-scaped; the waiver is earned because the payoff reuses the same celestial/garden imagery to reconfigure meaning. One minor causality wobble: the promise to the girl is introduced after the inciting pattern break, so stakes feel retro-fitted rather than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: journalist call → ascent → proof by contradiction → log surrender → drafted confession; the shutter-eyed closure image reweights the stake with visible cost—newsroom will drink “pen and contrition.” Orientation anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the firmware sleeps, the fold smooths, the name glows—cost is the permanent frost inside the chest now externalized as star-writing. Causality holds: each letter dictates a physical act that reconfigures the machine and the self. The amber–insect metronome bridges guilt and repair, paying off the opening image. Time-fold logic is taught early and crystallizes when the narrator’s own initials loop through the nephew’s.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mandala’s dissolution by tide reweights the premise—meaning is found in balance, not answers—felt cost is the emptied pocket sigh. Causal chain holds: tile → listening → gate → offerings → tide rinse; each because/therefore tightens options until only leaning remains. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by second paragraph and held without waver. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive inside 120 words via sensory cues, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.3)
    Situational lens holds: pressure crystallizes when the patrol arrives and the protagonist’s only weapon is the tessera-plus-story. Closure is a Charged Poise: the leader lowers the rifle, the plaza tastes of rain, mercy breathes—cost is the protagonist’s exposure and the leader’s self-recognition. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) and paid off when the intact past is re-seen through the tessera. No causality breaks; the mosaic stepping stone’s cracked syllables motivate the renaming tactic that resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the ghost renounce-save gesture (coin left star-side out) costs its talisman and re-opens the nursery path; Rowan’s choice to return with volunteers crystallizes possibility regained. Causal lattice—echo mechanics → timeline loosening → blueprint recovery—holds under lyrical Accumulative lens, with each echo tightening stakes. Orientation anchors who/where arrive by line 5, no penalty. No teleport or unkept set-ups; persistent price (coin abandoned) charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens: static shock → leaked appetite → build light-map → ground room → send recall email; each beat tightens options until the protagonist forecloses re-dosing. Closure is Earned Stasis: the grounded strap softens voices but the shard stays in pocket, a felt trade-off. Cost is legible in final image: “neighborhood hum” accepted in place of telepathic torrent. Orientation and set-piece causality clean; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    A single, continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 40 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chord fed into hibernation loops reweights the unknown from mute data to living invitation; cost is the irreversible exposure of her private map to the sleeping collective, felt when she “threads the chord” and sits alone on the cold step.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reweights from sentence to shared thread under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: catalog buttons → spiral → echo release → rain road opens, each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible in the final image of corked echo and heavier-brighter warehouse.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist finishes soldering the radio, foreclosing reunion with Mina; cost is legible in “you will go where she cannot.” Causal chain holds: pillbox cipher → snow writing → stranger’s vouchsafe → coil transplant → radio speaks. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“zephyr bluff in mist”). No lens ambiguity; causality drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: the single-thread vow is spoken, the shawl’s weight drops, and the ferry moves—cost is the forfeiture of all prior overwritten layers. Causal chain holds: swollen ford → waiting → coachman’s loosening gesture → narrator’s decisive stitch → crossing. No orientation debt; fog and river are anchored by word 40. Lens is situational-pressure; ambiguity resolved into crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each tender micro-repair adds a strand of kindness-density until the oasis itself answers; closure is a Charged Poise (“a pulse I felt in ankle, wrist, and teeth”) that reweights earlier braids with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 4), pattern taught early, transitions legible even across braided time. One causality bob: the lantern glass “tugs wrists” but never alters immediate tactics—small, non-closure, so −0.2. Still, the final accord lands with undeniable felt cost, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mesh of mirrors reweights the stairwell from fear-zone to play-zone, and the harbor’s discipline is repriced as communal resource. Causal chain holds—petal drop → padlock → mesh → light-spill—each step enabled by the gauge tooth and the oar-rhythm ethos. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“fire escape gardener”), well inside the 120-word window. The ending’s conceptual cost (shared vulnerability) is legible in Theo’s release and Mrs Gallo’s hum; persistent constraint (rusted tooth) shapes tactics and image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the sundial left on the threshold reweights every prior tide-pull under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ledger memory provides a sharp tightening beat that forecloses reunion-fantasy. Causality stays coherent—each hum-rise is triggered by the sundial’s angle—so the lens holds. Cost is unmistakable in the brass darkening to “late tea,” a conceptual repricing of reflection itself.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral of letters becomes a public maze that reconfigures both lovers’ options; ribbon thrums with felt cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tied pages and reweighted nest image tightens the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (time “after the storm,” place “lotus temple,” actor “I”). One causality nit: the ex-lover’s appearance edges coincidence, but crowd-opening reads as social magic, not resolution. Cost is visible: shared silence overtly forecloses old private letters.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scaffolded subsonic turns the station from mirror-of-hate to communal diaphragm, cost felt in the narrator’s greasy folded charts and the provost’s grinning nod. Causal chain holds: charts → gate timing → subsonic under hymn → barricades loosen. Orientation is swift: midnight booth, city breath, stakes named by line 3. One causal jump—provost’s pulse slowing without dramatized interiority—keeps this just under 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam opens, the satchel is retrieved, the city “rehearsed its rebellion” while the narrator carries the nail-key away—an earned stasis that forecloses the path of domination. Causal chain holds: grandmother’s compass → organ note → spatial hesitation → prick → seam → key. Cost is legible in the final image (“the nail in my pocket warmed”) and the conditional promise that pressures future action. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepened by cadence shift at the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: drip, click, ribbon sway tighten density until the submerged snag reframes both men. Closure is a Charged Poise—painting freezes captain’s wrists in self-arrest, cost legible in shared outline. Orientation clean by line 6; no prop or knowledge teleport. Metronome+ribbon pattern taught early and paid off in final image; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical density increases until the forecast “clicks” and the final image crystallizes options with felt cost (the table, the nail, the softening world). Orientation is taught early (boots, red bulb, kite array), no causality breaks; Seraphine’s samples re-weight the premise rather than solve by coincidence. Closure is Charged Poise: exile permission arrives yet narrator refuses, foreclosing immediate return—conceptual and emotional price legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flake stays behind to “light this crease,” reconfiguring the narrator’s stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fragmentary images (flake, scaffold wrap, boot prints) tightens into final crystallized image. Orientation is clear by line 4, no causality breaks; however, the vanish-return loop is coincidence-tolerant, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens the mosaic shards (train dusk → startup flashbacks → train night) tighten through pattern of territorial looping; closure reweights the premise when paper saints become protective wards for scrappers, a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: he abandons both father’s loot and last company relic. Orientation anchors at once (“end of a siding”), transitions legible by white-space beat. No causal breaks; mirrored loops feel inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome hums “like a shell,” the daylily loosens its breath, and the radioed lines reweight every prior silence with undeniable social cost—“shared burdens…are the only kind that lift.” Causal chain holds: telegram → R-Lyrae timing → mural vow → radio release, each because/therefore step narrowing options until the final braiding of breath. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of star-pulses = stone syllables = grief breaths, intensified by each exposure cycle; no late ambiguity. Orientation clear by line 8; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s spin stalls, the lake’s blank reflection reweights the premise—mirrors now show nothing, freeing Issa from the teacher’s lie. Cost is unmistakable: her blood feeds the seed, the seed eats her own binding, foreclosing the old identity. Causal lattice holds throughout (“because the trick failed, she remembered; because she remembered, she returned”). One shard, one continuous scene, no orientation debt; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught by line-level cadence and paid off in the final blank sky.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant slides into alignment, ribs ring, and the glade rewrites its own blueprint—undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each image layer (maze-veins, scar-sparks, quartz clicks) intensifies until the crosswind reweights possibility. Orientation is taught early (“cobalt glade at dusk”) and pays off in the final lung-opening. No causality breaks; the eclipse cheating time is the inciting condition, not a late convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-grafted laugh inside the cooled card is an undeniable reweighting of the premise, paid for by the narrator’s pledge to “share breath” and return as watchman—cost is legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of inlaying meaning tightens through each shard until the orchard becomes a loom. Orientation is taught early by the soot-stitched map; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the valley “answering” reconfigures silence into collaborative work and the narrator’s shame into forward agency, with the conceptual cost of lifelong indenture to ghosts. Causality holds—cloth → set list → Echo Bench map → vow—each because/therefore link tightening options. One causality hairline: the drawer yields the exact set list from the same tour inside a random filing cabinet in a quarry office, a lottery-level coincidence that slightly blunts escalation. Nevertheless, the final image reweights every prior echo metaphor, satisfying the cost test under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands: protagonist renounces reversal and chooses steady stewardship—Earned Stasis with visible cost: the fruit is left untouched, coils cradling seed, foreclosing personal rescue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images seed→coil→fruit form a tightening triad that reweights stakes from retrieval to caretaking. Orientation anchors within 90 words via rail junction, basalt pouch, night ocean—no orientation debt. Every magnetic adjustment is causally linked; no soft resets. The final line “patient, within touching distance” crystallizes Charged Poise—options reconfigured, bridge un-owned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the open window and “unhurried breaths” reweight the premise that wonder survives routine once tomorrow is gone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence and returning-image density tighten until the final tide annotation. Cost is felt conceptually—no tomorrow to chase—but not personally on the librarian, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pearl’s coronation reconfigures the cave from sealed bunker to communal sanctuary, and the cost—the inspector’s forfeiture of bureaucratic safety and the pearl’s irretrievable surrender—is legible in the final image. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal, but the inferred lens is consistent: each sensory beat layers density until the single gesture reframes all prior confessions. No orientation debt: “who/where/when” is anchored within the first 120 words. The ending is not an outline-like moral but an irreversible re-pricing of the space; any official who arrives must confront the new decree wedged under the gasket.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal sealed, the atlas annotated with blunt culpability, the chronicler’s future voice forever freighted with maintenance. Causal chain holds—romantic omission → clog → death → confession → physical clearing → public accountability—each beat tightening options. The 120-word orientation gate is met by line 5; no teleporting props or retro-patches appear. Cost is legible in the final image: chalk notes that “make no promises beyond truth,” a public scar that forecloses easy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist authors the second letter, looping time and sealing the frame between the two letters with conceptual cost—authorship becomes responsibility. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of delays, echoes, and mist-dense images tightens until the library admits only timed silence. Orientation is taught early (“my days existed between two fateful letters”) and pays off, so no penalty. One causality hairline: the ledger pre-bound with the veil is a convenience, not earned by prior action, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin liquefies, the empire’s alibi dissolves into river water the donors unknowingly taste—undeniable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric pattern (velvet / ice / stain / root) intensifies until the cadence shift at the river reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by ~80 words (“velvet observatory at midsummer”) and waived because disorientation pays off in the final image. Persistent constraint: the melting violin forecloses reversal—winter cannot be reclaimed once poured away.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald’s glimmer at mother’s throat crystallizes the threshold rule and forecloses reunion. Causal chain holds—each step from meltwater wash to mirror angle is because/therefore linked. Cost is palpable in the narrator’s relinquishing touch; no omniscient leap.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scalloped basins, hairpin, and vine cycles accrue meaning until the closing image reweights “contentment” from quest to daily practice; orientation is anchored by word 60 (“umbral grotto”), and the final Charged Poise shows felt cost—soil under nails, hairpin now holding living tissue. One tightening only, but it is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara lifts the hollow mirror, sees dawn flooding through, and accepts a path that keeps doorways open while admitting fear—cost is the porous uncertainty she now carries. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: wind-chime pattern taught early, reweighted at end when copper-bone-glass sequence “protect, remember, adapt” becomes the council speech she will give. Persistent constraint—her signature is still the knife—shapes tactics; no soft reset. Orientation clean within 120 words; geography (lighthouse stairs, chart nail) tracks throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: pressure mounts by accretion of image and withheld explanation, culminating in the Conceptual Repricing of the researcher’s disappearance. Causality is deliberately thinned—less plot than ritual—but the pattern taught by line-one (“sycamore hush”) obliges the reader to read by echo, not sequence; the final charge lands with undeniable cost as the boy-eyed mentor is simply gone and the rings persist.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the wandering pulse loops back as guide, the map draws itself while the narrator remains motionless—felt cost is the lifelong vigil acknowledged in “this map is never finished.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-layer reweights the stake until the final breath. Orientation is taught early by the bone-canyon throat image; no anchors ever blur. The persistent constraint (perpetual returning dust/echo) shapes the final image and forbids 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone is returned, the city’s grip loosens, and the lingering luminance remains “unpossessed yet shared,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density mounts through recurring mist, silence, and light images until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 7; no penalty. The only slack is a single soft causal link—why the garden trembles exactly when the stone is lifted—but the lyrical pattern teaches the reader to accept impossibility, so the lens stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tag’s hum gifts him a new hue of rest that reweights reality, cost felt in the open-door image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each lantern, ladder rung, and ledger phosphor thickens density until the final color reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“meteor hush of the harbor”) and paid off when that same hush folds around the final lamp, so no penalty. Persistent constraint: the sunken library’s sideways silence literally shapes how he listens and what he can become.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the backward song ends, the scatter is honored, the amber holds us angled toward beginning; the cost is the permanent stance of keeping the scatter honest, felt in the low bow of the array. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each cast, drip, and static burst tightens the pattern rather than linear plot; the lens holds. Orientation is taught early (“ambered observatory deck where sunset is trapped”) and pays off in the final honeyed light. No teleporting props; all objects (coins, coil, coolant) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the atlas folded with “Enough” reframes every prior fear-beast; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tape deepens the archive of dread—cost is legible in the act of folding the lexicon and walking out under night steps that “kept our lexicon burning.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: bell swings, seam knits, fish-ink remembers form—on-page image that reweights the rule-set (“the tide remembers what to do”). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; drip cadence tightens until the bell’s note becomes the cast line that absence answers. Cost is visible in the new crack and in Aro’s empty basket held up to silvered water. The ending satisfies the lens because the tempo shift (slow song replacing harvest) is the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain holds: label find → photo trail → maternal recognition → enforcement stay → communal line. Closure is a Decisive Change: the state order is openly countermanded, the ridge becomes a sanctioned memorial, and the moral cost—professional credibility, future liability—lingers in the final sentence. Orientation is anchored within 40 words; space-time never drift. Under 800 words, one tightening is sufficient; the mid-story “radio for a pause” is the pivot that narrows options and is paid for in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (crystal, flame, murmuration, moss-wrapped pears) layers until meaning reweights rather than plots in causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise—she presses the crystal to her brow, crystallizing the hybrid stance she’ll inhabit; cost is the postponed final firing and the perpetual openness it demands. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is vivid by line 4 and never wavers. One causality nit: the mentor’s instruction “listen wider than your ears” is told, not dramatized, but it motivates no beat, so penalty withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the sky removing its mask while the buckle “endures” reweights every prior breath of trust into an silent vow.  Causal linkage is tight—mentor’s muscle-memory map → radio-guided trace → buckle refastened → pride swallowed → arbor breath restored.  Orientation anchored by line 3 (“highest cradle”), no debt.  Cost is unmistakable: the watcher must remain anonymous, voiceless, sleepless—payment already accumulating in the coda’s inventory of “near failure.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared lift of the jar crystallizes a new guardianship pact with undeniable social cost—no one owns the seed once the forest arrives. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each opposite gesture (salt/sweet, fan open/close) layers density until the chimes fall silent, reweighting stakes without a causal zig-zag. Orientation is taught early via the floating dojo and torn horizon, paying off when the dojo lowers to let history "step on." Persistent constraint: the brain’s pulse-words etch fog that cannot be unsaid, shaping tactics at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each gift layers density until the corpse-flower rumor becomes a practical bulldozer shield; closure is the Charged Poise of the sprout and the widened town breath, cost legible in the ongoing vigil. Transitions (storm → mail → room → brook nights) are taught early and cohere; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the house exhales “room” and the fork-on-sill tuning fork re-prices the whole ritual with unresolved resonance. Causal chain holds: hourglass flip → tunnel entry → off-key wind → laughter half-returned; each grain is earned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sonic motifs (harmonica pennies, frost-skein laughter) tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable: part of the laughter is left in the tunnel forever, the family still“helpless,” conductor unpaid except by what he swallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the comma-ice inside the pendant reweights the boundary of light into a legible seam of hesitations, and the shared refusal to cross the window carries unmistakable relational cost under the Accumulative lens; every beat adds texture that culminates in this charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each firing failure tightens the next ratio; the crozier’s hollowing is the physical pivot that un-makes clerical power. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—“the loop of nothing” redirects the men’s certainty into breath, mills idle, mothers let go—cost paid in the bishop’s emptied symbol. Orientation is taught by sensory anchors within 120 words; twilight ember nexus locates us immediately. No causality breaks; even the cathedral-clock falter is cued by the frost-ember flower inhaling smoke.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s swing pauses, the map is drawn, the cost is the weight of every new beginning they must now ferry; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first wind-written wire to last glowing bucket, each static strip and commercial drop tightening the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator becomes the permanent hinge, ferry solid, self diffused—cost is the body dissolving into “the gap between whistles.” Causal chain holds: empty hourglass → star-pattern net → braided radio call → single shore. The sideways-clock rule is taught early and pays off in the final time-slip sacrifice. No orientation debt; spatial logic across grotto, boats, and piers remains trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each threaded line thickens the pattern until the floor’s “atlas of paths” reweights the premise, offering Mara a visible, felt cost—the curve that lets her approach without impact. Closure is a Charged Poise: two strangers walk beside each other in an “agreed equation,” foreclosing the solitary path her gallery once enforced.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain is clean: alien arrival → dome ethic → edge geometry → petition → ascent. Each because/therefore tightens options; the council’s sigh is the last external brake before the final ascent. Closure is a Decisive Change: they physically rise, horizon re-weighted by the ring’s live ellipse. Cost is legible: the city’s farewell hum is a sonic amputation—future isolation audible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glass panel shatters behind them, crystallizing the moment when Eli re-enters the living city under shared guardianship; the cost is the ever-present threat the suit-man represents and the narrator’s perpetual vigilance. Causal chain is tight: hearing-aid cue → locate Eli → photograph trigger → crowd shield → predator retreats. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, one deepening—meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: tidal cadence, cable hum, and electroscope flicker build density toward the charged poise of “Return” whispered as water rises. Closure is the crystallized instant where vigil outweighs extraction; cost is the foregone rescue of data. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; pattern of breathing caves teaches the tidal rule early and pays off in final image. No causality breaks; ellipsis of how files awaken is allowed under lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard-and-ink corridor rewrites the death certificate via visible social cost. Causal chain holds—ghost teaches pattern, protagonist pockets shard, descent will confront bureaucrats—though the “ink map” moment is slightly teleported in space inside the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the speaker becomes “an instrument more than a mouth,” canyon and self fused, language saved but self subsumed—undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens taught early (“tunnel of echoes…tightened the world into a single attentive breath”) holds through final braid-image. Pattern taught by 120-word mark, no orientation debt. The ending line “whoever listens next” reweights all prior texture-sound translation, satisfying CR without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard thickens the subterranean texture until the final “phone clicked as if satisfied” reweights the stake—the city might remember without breaking. Causality is loose but coherent; the arrowhead’s hum, pollen orbit, and pun orbit accumulate into a Charged Poise that forecloses the old investigative stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers density until the final silence re-prices the city’s rule-set. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the new silence took root”—with undeniable conceptual cost (rails uprooted, schedule lost). Orientation is taught by sky-bridge → ladder → orchard spatial track; no anchor confusion. Persistent constraint: the locust shell as quiet amplifier shapes every tactic and the final stillness—meets 9+ quick test, capped at 8.7 by slight teacher-dependency noted in Q1.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a causal track but the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; the storm-bottle is used once to fog cameras, a clever but low-cost evasion. The father–son reunion is off-stage, so the promised “broken promises heal” is implied, not dramatized. The final crowd vigil is a quiet stance, not a decisive change that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of silence→possibility threads each beat; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as breath converts hush into carousel shiver. Causality is lyrical but legible: because he listens to rails→finds oasis→lifts halo→fits crown→exhales note, therefore carousel stirs—each step foreshadowed. Orientation anchored inside first 60 words; later spatial moves track cleanly. Cost is felt on-page: persistent bucket-and-breath labor, foreclosing shortcut/noise. No meaningful escalation cap violated; tightening occurs when crown fragment clicks and platform shivers, narrowing options to silent motion only.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library “breathes out” and books grow heavier, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises via recursive shelving, coral-like corridors, and scarf warmth until stance crystallizes. Orientation is taught early (“I keep the lights low…”) and anchors hold; the clock ticks in verses, sustaining temporal legibility. A near-miss for 8+ because the decisive emotional cost is diffuse—felt more as atmosphere than as a singular, visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unlatched door reweights every prior capture attempt into a deliberate non-cage, with the conceptual cost that the librarian forecloses reunion with Aria. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the final image is a pattern break that reconfigures meaning rather than a causal solve. Orientation is taught by ~80 words; disorientation serves closure payoff. Cost is legible in the final line: “what I love may pass through” = permanent porousness = felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the corridor opens inward, the scholar crosses, and the locksmith keeps the empty box—cost made legible in one image. Causal chain holds: ribbon→scent→tumblers→door, all triggered by star-breath that was promised and arrives. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hush, dust, moth-wing light intensifies until the final bright exhalation reconfigures meaning. No orientation ambiguity; who/where/when anchored by “hill where three roads crossed” inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the right name surfaces, the greenhouse exhales, the coat of light is worn—an earned reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the missing-star mapping is the single tightening that reweights memory’s absence, and cost is legible in the final taste of cider.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s hinge-glyph physically opens, brother steps out, archivist’s own exile is proven still locked. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: tea-leaf geometry → hinge glyph → annotation → release, each beat thickens pattern rather than forcing plot turns. Cost is unmistakable in the final sentence—“my turn arrived” denied. Orientation clear by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each captured essence and pruning gesture thickens color-density until the Gray’s drink reweights the world. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; later spatial shifts (root bridge, echo orchard) track cleanly. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valley brightens, the seed’s root silver-thread visible, cost acknowledged (“I trimmed to make space for arrivals”). The only abrasion is a soft causal leap—the Gray’s instant conversion via one glass—so the repricing feels slightly convenient, not irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the coffer rises, the name is spoken, the father’s drag on the daughter’s sleep ends, and the sanctuary’s silence is braided with his laugh—an undeniable after-cost. Causal chain holds: each un-knot → net sigh → coffer lift → spirit release, all signaled early and paid off in the final image. Orientation is taught in the first 60 words (“prism sanctuary under starlight,” “glass ribs arc above me”) and never drifts. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of hush and refracted light accretes until the final gravity shift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the panel lifts, maps of pollen and soot are discovered, yet the narrator chooses to leave the chapel “neither hidden nor announced,” reconfiguring the meaning of access and silence. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the tightening arrives via density of salt blooms, ribbon abrasion, lichen patterns—each layer reweights the stake of respectful disclosure. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator forgoes possession/exposure, accepting perpetual custodial tension. One minor orientation wobble: farmer’s “palm cupping a north so general” delays concrete geography past 120 wds, but the disorientation later serves the closure’s ethic of intentional ambiguity, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the snow-globe release reweights the meaning of “LET GO TO LIFE” and forgives the narrator’s metric grief. Orientation is anchored by ~70 words; the disorientation of being inside a “forgotten sunken ship library” is functional and pays off in the final image. Persistent cost—his decision to loosen grip on the globe—crystallizes on the page and is inseparable from the tape’s instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural stiffens into a “lantern” of circuitry and petals, the ghost disperses with a promise shaped like a pause, and the bolt plate is left as a future key—cost is felt in the forfeiture of anonymity and the exposure of hidden needs. Causality holds throughout: each graffiti glyph is a because/therefore plea that narrows the ghost’s options until it compiles micro-kindnesses. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift; the misty cloud-courtyard is stable scaffolding. The final image of descending song reweights the premise: the city will breathe differently because of this encoded silence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ten-floor climb is a perfect causal ratchet: each numbered stop both tightens time and reveals new knowledge that forecloses options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the goggles and diary are relinquished, breathing out the names— with visible conceptual cost (“the letters finally settle into sleep”). Lens is cleanly Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes when the balloon steadies to “grateful for a new center” while narrator admits “I know you are already geography,” a conceptual price paid; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cloud-categories and thread-knots thickens until meaning reframes. No orientation debt; sky-gondolas and star-grit are clear by line-30. One causal bump: altimeter/burner actions appear only after telescope sketch, but pattern teaches tools as extensions of gaze, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensual layer (graphite bloom, migrating cracks, gold constellations) thickens the stake rather than linear cause-and-effect. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the room exhales a portable sky, the imminent wreckage now weighted with unlosable memory—cost is felt in the dare to “breathe here later.” Transitions are seamless; orientation is taught by line 3 and never drifts. A hairline slip: the rubbing-to-wall pinning beat is compressed; the instant of decision could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the luminous exile is folded, not captured, reweighting the premise of possession. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (birds, hopscotch, net-hum) tightens possibility until the fold is the only honest act. Orientation is clear by line 6; no debt. One shard, single POV, cost visible—“still bright but finally held.”

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored gleam adds density until the hall becomes a “soft clock of kindness,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed yet taught by line 3 and payoff at closure, so Orientation Test is waived. Closure lands on the quiet chime and listening stance—Earned Stasis with felt price. One micro-turn: mirrors shift from threat to pathway braid.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is cleanly landed: the sky opens, dew falls, and the chalk admonition “Reexamine what you call haunting” conceptually re-prices the premise with social cost—trust is now mutual labor, not mystic dependence. Causal chain holds: chalk instructions → bell choreography → nebula arrival; no teleporting props or retro fixes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 120 words; floating arches and orchard planet rules remain consistent. Accumulated pattern (arches, chalk, bell) tightens once through the cadence shift at dusk—sufficient escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cumulative/Textural lens is taught at once (“nested patterns,” tide cadence) and held to the final image; closure is a Charged Poise where slower time and inward ribbon-light reweight the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are nested inside sensory detail—no penalty. The sequence of key-turns and lullaby scatter is legible micro-escalation; no causal turns are required under this lens. Final line “to welcome” crystallizes the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the nut’s blueprint is transferred, the corridor granted, and the caretaker returns to solitary erasure—cost paid in the final image of “leaving myself behind where no one could touch.” Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each wind-deception, dust-shiver, and reed-snap tightens the lattice until the pattern snaps open a bird-free passage. Orientation anchors early and cleanly; the single-scene shard stays within word count. Only a micro-slip: “beneath them, trees…” drifts geography for one beat before re-anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the polymer bridge flexes under their combined weight, reweighting separation into connection while the chrysalis sinks—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout: because she traced foam, therefore she designs zip/unzip polymers; because she invites, he hesitates then steps—tightening options. The empty-shell image persists as constraint that shaped tactics. Cost legible in the final muted C of wind and heron flight—no exposition needed.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (glass leaves, tidal pulse, frost seal) thickens the stakes of “glimmering parole” until the final ledger brightens—an undeniable conceptual repricing. The woman’s release and the narrator’s self-incision form a paired Decisive Change with mirrored cost. Orientation is taught by lyric delay; anchors arrive just after 120 words and pay off in closure. No causal break; closure cost is legible in the silvered counter and the audible breath the narrator finally claims.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the coral drinks, the dunes listen, and the city’s grief is reweighted from shattering to “fitted” inside the body. Causal chain holds—because the chef melts a memory-shard into broth, therefore the pavilion humming becomes a new audible silence—cost is the stinging brine he continues to taste. Accumulative lens dominates; pattern of tidal pool → coral ribs → steaming broth teaches the reader how grief can be decanted and returned. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“desert fortress after rain”); no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bridge’s completion reweights storage into passage and revalues “measure” as mercy. Causal linkage holds: because Mara hears the elevator’s polyglot loneliness, therefore she mobilizes choir→councilman→timber, each because-step narrowing options until the span arcs. Accumulated languages become literal fasteners; cost is visible in dawn sweat and the relinquished talisman. Lens (Hybrid → Accumulative dominant) is taught by line 4 and re-asserted in final “puente, mitawa.”

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s triple-moon image crystallizes the choice to stop fossilizing grief, with conceptual cost—“I could not undo, but I could modify.” Causal chain holds: because the headset re-patterns cortex → therefore memory strata shift → therefore future stance is remapped. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (moonlit canyon, battered kit). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts by density and cadence, not external plot turns. Minor slip: the bridge-storm flashback is a single summarized beat, softening the decisive causal trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via patterned inversion and holds: each threshold adds density rather than causal linkage. Closure lands as Charged Poise—tokens whisper “syllables of safes” while the grotto breathes a promise of return—reconfiguring the archive’s future with conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. The price is legible: perpetual return-risk, sleepless vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the quiet phrase is offered to river, hedgehog, grove, and the world re-weights itself; the cost is the perpetual return, the vow of listening that forecloses louder triumphs. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught by the first paragraph’s echo of “create music in a silent world” and re-energized in the final line without causal ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the tipped king and rising needle reconfigure the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost—“keepers until morning” lands as both honor and sentence. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each chess move correlates with magnetic/avian signals, tightening the silence until the field “considers us again.” Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. No artifact obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the piece teaches its pattern early—each silence catalogued is a bead on a sounding wire—and closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp’s click transmutes the workshop into “a lung that learned patience from a stone,” reweighting every prior hush. Orientation is swift (who/when/where by line 3) and the single shard holds. Cost is felt: the sky literally ruptures with fireworks the moment he accepts soot-as-script, proving the pacifist path purchases its wisdom at the price of audible, public triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each donated scrap and smelled decay layer intensifies the stake until the bloom becomes a shared respiratory rite. Closure is a Charged Poise—the village exhales together, reconfigured—and the cost is the enduring stink they accept as new normal. One transition (seasons braid) is legible; orientation is swift and tree-top anchoring never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: arrow-tip lineage → mother’s promise → launch → veil → wound → plug → restored echo → seed souvenir. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length; it lands the moment the tip clicks into place and time/fruit re-blossom. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the planet’s rule-set literally re-knits, the protagonist forfeits altitude and heroic solitude to become steward, and the cost is the sky-river itself narrowing to a sane flow. No orientation debt; floating arches and anti-grav hour are cued before word 120.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grid now “holds” when the scheduled gust arrives, reweighting the premise that ports must bow to weather. Cost is legible in the salt-stained signature and the town’s still-fragile radios—silence has been replaced by vigilance, not noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk arrow, soot V, and hinge-tapping crate layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 80 (“port is already holding its breath”).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each image-layer (bell-tone → color → hush) tightens the weave until the sculptor’s chisel-hit lets the hush “stand” as crystallized bridge; closure is the Charged Poise instant where aurora-fed hush becomes portable witness, reconfiguring city/council stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—no causal gaps, orientation taught by 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loom settles, markers curve toward listeners, stance reconfigured with conceptual cost—“I will carry driftwood… where the listening begins.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early via canyon hush ↔ loom braid; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: star vanishings supply cadence, ink proofs supply density. Closure is a Charged Poise—the halo fragment left on press, the shared breath after a star winks out—cost is felt in the shoulder-drop and cleaner breath. The “third grammar” line supplies the decisive reconfiguration, not just metaphor but a printed artifact that reweights prior pronoun slippage. One scaffold: “We kept printing, because the stars were not staying” repeats the same cause twice; else clean.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: releasing the pendant reweights the rule-set, returning “sharpness to the coming light” with conceptual cost—tomorrow’s wonder will ache. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; tension accrues through pattern of extension/release rather than exterior reversals. Orientation is taught early—“aurora-lit ridgeway,” first-person, night—so no penalty. One minor scaffold: “the method is simple to say and hard to hold” repeats the same idea twice; clipped but not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns accumulate density until the prism’s refraction reweights the stake—“objects absorb emotions”—with conceptual cost. The final image (keys set down “as if they might bruise”) delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the cabin air’s new density is felt, not explained. No causality break; every beat (heater hum, frost ferns, prism flare) is an intensification, not a random cue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; later disorientation (mist dog) serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square keeps its low glow, the orchard still sighs, yet the sister stands there—distance reweighted, cost paid in seasons of waiting. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence layers, edges hum, bead warms; the final breath-out footfall reconfigures meaning without causal reversal. Persistent constraint—the orchard would die if she left—shapes the renunciation and charges the final image. Cost is legible in the lantern oil and patience poured into the patient dark.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the planet’s descriptor re-weights from threat to makable home, paid for by the blacksmith’s surrendered voice and childhood echo. Causal chain holds—silk→bell→barter→arch settling—each trade narrowing options. Accumulative lens dominates: pattern of bartered memories thickens until the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. Cost is legible in the last line: “my voice thinned to thread,” a persistent constraint that shapes future work.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the withheld truth is released, weight redistributed across universes, narrator’s role redefined. Causal linkage holds: shard→chime→log→voices released; each step because/therefore. Orientation anchored by line 5 (“abandoned spaceport repair bay”) and continually re-anchored through sensory cues. One meaningful tightening at crate-opening beat narrows options from secrecy to exposure. Cost is legible: narrator’s body becomes corridor, throat raw with foreign rain. Minor waver: “I know now the origin of my cycles” explains rather than dramatizes the epiphany, a hairline slip keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sealed jar reconfigures the keeper’s legacy under undeniable conceptual cost—archival death vs. living breath. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: every letter, stone, and drop of oil accrues until the final image reweights the stake. The orientation anchor (who/where) is taught by sentence 3; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical repetitions, beam/laughter/storm pattern grows density until the gyre’s pivot reweights stakes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—lighthouse stands, narrator reaffirms custodial craft—cost felt in “older and lighter” log entry and the wick’s tenderness. Causality intact: laugh → gyre hooks → beam braids storm into beneficent rain. Orientation anchored by word 30; no lens drift. One scaffold loop (“the beam maps the gyre, and the gyre maps…”) grazes closure but does not obscure image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist accepts echo over drum, crystallized in the gift of the morpho wing. Cost is legible in the final image—he must “move until the shimmer chooses you,” surrendering control of narrative flow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern (sun trails, wing shimmer) tightens until meaning re-weights, no causal turn required. Orientation is taught by lyric disorientation early and pays off at the edge of the floating rock, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator sets the sextant down, trades the pin for a twig, and the map “will hold”—a crystallized moment where options reconfigure without exposition. Causality is lyric, not mechanical: the sextant’s cracked mirror “clicks,” aligning sorrow-numbers with bark grain, a poetic therefore that tightens stakes under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is lyrically delayed but functional: “stormlit tower by moonlight” anchors place/weather in line 1; who/why surface within 40 words—well inside waiver. No prop or knowledge teleports; the ledger, sextant, and dream-dust recur with consistent physics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woven dawn is raised, the realm inhales, and the keeper is emptied—cost is felt in the image of sparks “stitching hearth to hearth.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of song→mica→thread→sky taught early and tightened once; orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 8. One causality micro-gap: the storm-of-breach that cracked the pane is recounted, not dramatized, so the price of that failure is inferred rather than re-experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands: Mara’s conceptual re-pricing—error becomes bridge—pays out in the charged image of “harbor steady, error cherished,” with unmistakable emotional cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored weights (paper/breath, harbor/ship) tightens meaning without causal reversals. One scaffold hiccup: “Do you see how the forward becomes kind…” is explanatory surplus just before resonance peaks, nicking perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as legitimate Charged Poise: the chalked bakery name erased by dew crystallizes the cost of tenuous absolution and reconfigures the group’s vigil. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and rituals mounts until the final image reframes prior effort. Orientation is swift (palace grounds, after birds leave) and the single transition (night → dawn) is legible. Causality holds: because they uncloak and plant, the tea house breathes and the chalk faces erasure—an on-page price under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the last paragraph crystallizes the endless task under a “clean blank of survival,” reweighting the premise that even failure to save a vow is a form of shelter. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sampled frequency adds density until the final lattice of data becomes the library’s own vow. Cost is legible in the phrase “I do not know how long we can hold the passing back,” spoken after an on-page avalanche sigh. Orientation is taught early; spatial logic holds across the domed vault and atrium ice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the recorded buckle inside the rewired fob reweights the premise, offering a tangible, conceptual repricing of trust. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—the false-start bargaining pattern strips the fence’s mask until the belt-buckle micro-sound is captured. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold; no penalties apply. The only minor drag is a mid-section loop where “listening stillness” is reprised three times without fresh pressure, but it does not blunt the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the taste of “clean stone and warm milk” reweights the premise—weather-carrying is bridge-work, not sentence—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and the aurora-forest election conceit is taught early enough to waive disorientation penalty. Causality holds: each tasted flavor triggers the next micro-move toward the bluff summit. Cost is felt in the narrator’s trembling mouth, but the final beat is more image than irreversible choice, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open niche, the scarf warming his neck, and the cave’s returning chime reconfigure his stance toward art and grief with felt cost. Causal chain holds: memory → failed lock → painting-within-painting → key → first drawing; each step is legible and tightens options. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the lyric repetitions teach the pattern early. One minor causality bump: the “combination was for show” reveal is ingenious but flirts with coincidence; nevertheless, the final image absorbs the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the city’s confiscated conversations are returned the instant the narrator pays with candid micro-confessions, reweighting the rule that breath = currency. Causal lattice holds: because he lies in a letter ➜ body wilts ➜ learns to gild only truths ➜ Ear tests candor ➜ words released. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside 40 words and never wavers. The zinc plate + shredded map dovetail is motivated by each prior beat; no teleporting props. Cost is on-page: “my wrists went weak because I had paid with a lie”—the physiological price is visible and recurs at closure when he stands “still” while the ribbon inspects him. Drive lens is Causal; pattern is taught early and never contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the aurora thickens because the community accepts flawed honesty, reweighting the premise that silence equals truth. Causal chain holds: iceberg → tunable light → communal exposure → aurora replenished; each because/therefore advances knowledge. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“seasonally mute”), well inside 120-word window. Persistent constraint—the fragment’s melting—shapes final image and charges the ending with undeniable water-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (dome breathing, copper breadcrumbs, smoke spirals) layers density until the magnetic shift reweights all stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: the android kneels, burying the first packet along the new north—simultaneously caretaker, archive, and refugee—cost legible in “glass lung finally done breathing.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80. One causal micro-turn—compass stutter triggers burn—suffices for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the curator listens, neighbors supply memories → locket yields half-moon key → mailbox opens → communal cost paid. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bundles of unmailed letters rewire neighbor guilt into mutual aid, with the inspector’s lowered cutters as visible cost. One orientation waiver: courtyard anchors arrive by word 80, pattern taught early and pays off. No meaningful tightening beat is missing, but the drone beat feels slightly ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: tanks exhale, minds exit, bolts relax—cost is the flooded lab left behind and the unreadable journals that will be dismissed as “simple notes.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each journal entry adds density until daemon’s instinct is rewired. Pattern taught early—spider-web radial lines mirrored by coded entries—pays off when web finishes itself and protagonists rise through hatch. No orientation debt; sunken corridor anchors arrive by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Charged Poise—cubes tapped against whale ear-bone release names back into tide, reweighting the harbor’s silence with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-linkage rather than because/therefore; pattern taught early (flame leans, gravity pockets) and paid off at whale altar. Orientation anchored inside first 120 words (Ilya, pier night, whale). No meaningful escalation under this lens is required; single deepening at crystals → whale suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final image of the moon-low clearing “ordinary again” reweights everything prior, sealing the prophecy’s power loss with conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because he maps silence, therefore the code disperses—under an Accumulative/Textural lens taught early by patterned sound/quiet juxtapositions. No orientation debt; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint is the newly learned quiet that now must be guarded, visible in the gentle current he leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—meteor punctuation, wax impressions, rooftop grammar—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city now “speaks in courtesies” while the narrator bears “borrowed authority.” Closure carries felt cost (the cooling seal on skin) and the pattern holds. Orientation is secure by line 3; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening beat suffices, but causal linkage stays light—more atmospheric accretion than because/therefore chain—so cap stays below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the speaker becomes the door, Reina walks “through me,” and the quarantine sign dissolves—an unmistakable before/after with conceptual cost (“practice kindness” revealed). Causality is lyric but legible: each resonance test narrows options until the only remaining path is self-transcendence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (garden resonance, shell echo) is taught early and pays off in the final image. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 20.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the decree sighs, chains slacken, and the protagonist accepts an unopened door in himself—cost is the pricked blood and the permanent partial freedom; under the Accumulative/Textural lens the drip-cadence and aurora flares tighten meaning until the final image reweights the city’s obedience without requiring causal reversals; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s echo-market is short-circuited when names return untendered, a social cost made legible in the glittering syllables. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sung layer thickens pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; disorientation serves the lyric pattern and is repaid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant the narrator speaks “Leda,” the shrine inhales, starlight pours, and every prior dream-window reconfigures from fragment to raft—cost is the irreversible cold now lodged in the narrator’s palms. Causality is lyric but traceable: each dream-cameo tightens the search vector, the globe’s blank core refracts the protagonist’s face as obligation, and the final lift forecloses silence. Accumulative lens holds from first candle to last seal; no ambiguity at the hinge. The ending image reweights the whole lyric pattern without a syllable of explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new “moon-loop” stitch reweights the entire village’s moral ledger, with the cost felt in elders’ “subtle ache” and the philosopher’s unpaid pouch—undeniable on-page price. Causal chain holds: whistle summons fireflies → reveals widow → triggers joint mending → loosens future nets; each because/therefore link narrows options from accusation to collaborative restraint. Orientation is swift: parapet, post-rain, night, and stakes (“confession before dawn”) all appear within 60 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern holds to the final nail where the whisk dries beneath “living commas” of fireflies.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s “miracle” is re-priced as radioactive dust-trap, the diamond as truth-tuning fork, the narrator’s silence as complicity. Causal chain holds: shredded letters → reveal Stillwater → explain stillpoint → choice to publish partial truth. Cost is on-page: “I would write what was there… leave the names out” carries professional and moral price. Lens (Causal) never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the portico spidered but standing, tomorrow left “visible-stringed,” not magical. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—storm-light and radio hiss braid into a final cadence shift that reweights the city’s stance. Cost is legible in Kestrel’s burn and the tower’s cracked glass; the visionary’s anonymity is a foreclosed path. Causality holds: council blinked because lightning-fed antennas repelled cutters, then grandparents’ war-lullabies fed the living song.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of bottling sound → gifting sound → becoming bridge. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new jar labeled “Kin” reweights all prior harvests with conceptual cost—he forfeits solitude for generational translation. Causality intact; no prop teleport or missing setup; orientation anchored by word 50.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Collector skiff retreats, key cools to “temperature of trust,” cost felt in the relinquished sale. Causal lens holds throughout; only miniature lapse is sunset clock never visibly pushes tactics, but that is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council’s “slow exhale” reconfigures future options with felt cost of forsaken haste. Causal lens holds: moon-iron experiment → vote → new rhythm. Persistent constraint (lunar schedule) shapes next three nights. Cost crystallized in “return barren” clause.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is ironclad: because the retrofit control module was sealed remotely, the grate stayed shut; therefore three men died; therefore the investigator discovers corrosion + nepotism; therefore she cuts the director’s feed and files the unerasable report. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—her stepping into “my own signal” beneath moving trains—earned by every prior measurement and micro-choice. The lantern’s final placement at the junction box reprises the Underground-Railroad promise, reweighting the meaning of “tunnels can lead somewhere other than work” without breaking the because-therefore lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the repaired heart’s ticking reweights the premise—apology must become mechanical labor. Causal chain holds: rain→break→shop→repair→plan. Orientation is clean by 120 words. The final constraint—Hector must keep repairing boxes to deserve trust—persists with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the bell rings unheard, acid ripples spell an alphabet for future ears, and the workshop gears adopt “a new patience” – all with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: arrow tip → coordinates → bellframe → slot tip → pull → ring → sea writes. No teleporting props; the arrow’s earlier lodgement in the rain-whale justifies its final shape. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern is taught early. The −0.8 accumulation cap does not apply because closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly accumulates 1103/17/patch echoes to the final letting-go; the Conceptual Repricing in the last line (“for one night that feels like mercy”) pays off with societal/ethical cost without cliché. Closure unit intact, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: shard → mirrors → globe → envoy promises → joint walk. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern beam stitches pans while the narrator steps into slush—cost is the forfeiture of detached safety. Persistent constraint: the shard shard still in pocket reminds humility will keep shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator consciously postpones death again, now schooled by the harbor’s grammar of almost-endings. Causal chain holds—storm salvage → Mikko’s mentoring → sonic revelation → choice to wait. Orientation is taught early (drift-ice marina, euthanasia reservation envelope). No teleporting props; parasol tip, tapes, and crate accrue meaning and reappear to sharpen the final pause.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sentinel stays alone, yet the pavilion air is re-weighted by the traveler’s phone-call and the vow to return, turning “lone” into a voluntary stance rather than a fate. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (charred paper, spicy libation, moonlit gravel) thickens until the final image reconfigures solitude as permeable. Orientation is swift and spatially tracked. One causality micro-gap: the traveler’s sudden appearance is un-set-up, but coincidence is allowed to complicate, not resolve, under this lens. Cost is visible in the libation and the lamp’s dark.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last hush crystallizes the collective stake—preserve the echo—and the final image reweights every prior knot and dune-sound. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each clearing tightens the ambient stillness until the pavilion’s murmur resolves into a single audible breath. The missing prophet functions as persistent negative space, a constraint that shapes tactics rather than an absent plot cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the wing-span installation holds the town under quiet pressure, the map-case is now empty, and the narrator’s promise to “return tomorrow” foregrounds ongoing care; cost is felt in the collective hush and the literal weight lost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each pinned photograph adds density until the corridor becomes a single membrane of shared memory. Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, but the final image reweights all prior fragments with undeniable communal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise where the library becomes “a garden of ears,” a Conceptual Repricing that reweights culture itself. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each echo-scatter tightens the same stake until the custodians’ lowered eyes certify the shift. Orientation is complete by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image—“quiet forward like a pocket of patient rain”—a portable burden he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the recorder’s gray-light bloom reweights the entire premise—growing older is not a sound to be captured but a tide that erases the captor. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each chalk command and driftwood arrow thickens the pattern until the final image (“a harbor he could not remember yet”) crystallizes the cost of living in foretold amnesia. Pattern taught by line 4 (“wrote himself instructions”) and paid off in the last breath; no causal turns required, only density that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the governor seats, time steadies, but the narrator’s renunciation of Lina’s physical presence is the felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—leaf cadence reweights stakes rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. One meaningful tightening: leaf-loop reseats governor, foreclosing spinning chaos. Cost legible in final “quiet” that spreads through bolts.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the gauze-wrapped shard pressed to muted strings reweights “broken things singing” with undeniable cost. Causal chain—bloodwork → rooftop → call → reunion → mute chord—holds without ellipsis gaps. Time, place, and cast are anchored by line 3; no orientation debt. The mute chord is the decisive physical act that makes the goodbye legible and final.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mosaic of discovery beats accretes under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the orientation is swift (isle / night / brass rail) and closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—shadows pay the buoyancy tax—yet the final “light weight leaves my ribs” is abstract; a crisper bodily cost would clinch the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: reed-body → hedge map → tooth-key → garden stair → living boy; each step is triggered by a concrete micro-action (Mara presses tooth, hedge exhales, root-steps appear). Closure lands with Earned Stasis: the narrator carries the boy out and concedes past error to the father—cost is the public admission of fallibility—while the lens (Causal) holds throughout. One minor lapse: the fox-leg cure doubles as climactic hinge yet the injury is introduced only seconds before it is solved, so the constraint is fresher than the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of polishing, weighing, and hush-braiding intensifies density without external reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shared glow reconfigures village and cave relationship with undeniable conceptual cost (permanent earthbound vigil). The price is diffuse but legible in “village songs might fade,” anchoring the final beat under reflective stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the pendant’s swing turns the data-center-ruin into a monastery of quiet labor, repricing “confession” from public spectacle to daily graft. Cost is legible in the narrator’s refusal to speak again until the moss can “carry my fear without breaking its stem,” a forfeiture of redemption-on-demand. Accumulative lens holds: each drip-track and stitch intensifies texture until the final hush reweights stakes. No causal gaps; even the bee’s entrance is foreshadowed by thaw grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell/knot/star triptych reweights the entire metaphysical rule-set—stories must be released, not kept. The “feral nexus” pattern is taught within the first 120 words; disorientation serves the closure eye-opening. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: migrating meanings cohere into a single cadence shift when the narrator kneels and the books “nod.” Cost is legible in the shaking legs and the final stillness after the shell ring—an audible toll paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph (moonlight “drawing out nerves…into glyphs”) and held to the final image of “breakfast steam rose.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the arbor’s single shiver reconfigures the village’s stance toward daily covenant, and Lio’s prone body is the felt cost. Everything aligns inside the 120-word orientation window; no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plate prints a pale braid of three pulses that reweights the orchard silence into a road. Causality holds: each beat—etching the plate, bleeding starlight, flash-paper flares—literally maps Fen’s heartbeat onto paper, making the final image inevitable. Cost is visible: the last wax seal and the tripod left behind stand as forfeiture. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: echo-density grows into a pattern that reweights time itself; closure lands as Charged Poise—tuned timer breathes, winter-humility jar labeled. Orientation anchors by line 4 (who, where, when). Causality is present though soft: because the cave tallies whispers, therefore the locksmith harvests them to rebuild the escapement; the stakes tighten when the cave’s indifferent tutelage forces him to pay with patience and calibrated silence. Cost is legible in the final image—“wounded season” watermark inside the mechanism—so the closure is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s stitched cord becomes an Earned Stasis—visible ribbon-net of service—whose cost is felt when the valley figure nods and the shingles lift. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “orienting properly” repeats and tightens until lamp-star alignment reweights meaning rather than inventing new plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“After the first snowmelt…”), well within the 120-word window. The only minor slip: the final “freedom is a circle” statement could have been left to the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving, steam click, and sugar grain adds density until the final “steel-warmed” peace reweights loss. Closure is Charged Poise—the cage/boat floats in tea, crystallizing before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchored inside 120 words (“Rain steps softly…loft”).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each camera-wheel click deposits a story-fragment that reweights the stake—“rhythm sculpted them” re-prices the past so the final spray-question mark becomes Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Closure is clean: the carousel’s shudder acknowledges the vow-forfeit, making the cost legible on-page. Persistent constraint: the vow, once paid, cannot be reclaimed—this shapes the final image under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the terminal’s gentle glow and whispering fountain reconfigure meaning with felt cost—she can “afford” only a few lights. Causal chain holds: sextant → skylight → sensor → pump; each step is traceable, no luck resolves. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal”), well inside 120-word limit. Accumulated/Textural lens is taught early (“maze of intentions engraved”) and holds through final cadence shift from stale air to misted breath.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell accepted “the way snow accepts the shape of a sleeping fox” reweights the premise—silence can include a music that does not break it. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each image thickens the hush rather than triggers causal turns. Cost is felt in the final ledger entry: “time bear me lightly instead of the other way around.”

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sundial’s shadow becomes a black verdict that reweights every prior ledger scratch and crate label; the canal breeze “as if witnesses exhaled” makes the social cost undeniable. Causal lattice is tight—because sundial scratches align with ledgers, therefore the hatch is opened; because the siren is wound, therefore the town’s listening is threaded. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of water-images, paper-flutter, radio hush accrues until the pattern ruptures with the siren blast. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3, the sundial warm against the chest by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the dock will be destroyed, therefore they must decode→preserve→plant; splice-extraction and council threat tighten options. Closure is Earned Stasis: they have not saved the dock yet, but the rope-language is now duplicated in the fisherman’s hands—cost is the undeclared future loss and the tar-stained thumb. One micro-turn (tar bead → sprig) lands at 75 %, satisfying escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the thread once tethering absence becomes the stitch that maps the city’s Mercy档案馆; the geography of healing is revealed as migration, not return, with undeniable social cost—the archive will outlive the archivist. Accumulative lens holds: each new obituary adds density until the final image of the thread-sketched currents reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the last line—“absence grows intimate with mercy”—a price the narrator will keep paying. No causality breaks; transitions are legible shards in a mosaic taught by the 25 % mark.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric density increases until the hatchling’s song reweights the stake—palace shoulders “lower,” chains applaud—delivering a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by dissonant diction (“palace anchored to giant stalactites”) and pays off at closure when stalactites feel “less like teeth, more like roots.” One meaningful tightening occurs when the Keepers’ clamps are silenced by song, foreclosing violent seizure. No causality breaks; even the egg’s warmth is legible as texture that tilts the palm toward abyss.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each graft and coin-swing thickens the pattern of repair until the breeze-activated chorus reweights the meaning of “scars can sing.” Orientation is swift—lagoon, dunes, charred trunks all named by word 50; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin left singing in trees crystallizes the stance of unyielding compassion and imprints an audible, conceptual cost—she forever forfeits her private metronome. Causality holds; every splice is because/therefore motivated by the need to coax sound from wound.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the paired gears placed in starlike moss reconfigure inheritance from repetition to transmission, felt cost legible in “wide enough to plant trust.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of floral light, gears, sonar pings layers until cadence shifts at orrery song; “heartbeat tempo” hush satisfies RR. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4 (“I tended the nebula garden…”) and stays spatially trackable. Persistent price—ancestral vow now shared—shapes tactics and final image with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loosened braid and glowing gaps reconfigure collective grief from containment to reception, with visible cost (the stone’s hollows, the slackened ribbons). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ribbon crossing and poem stanza layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ancient greenhouse at dusk”) and never breaks. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the single deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the slimmer bell tone reweights communal time itself, the cost is the retained lead in the bob and the unswallowed pellets. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each carved notch → one pellet moved, the pattern taught by line 5 and paid off in the final cadence. Orientation is immediate (first three clauses give who, where, when) and the pendulum pause is the single shard/scene; no teleport or unkept set-ups. The “different sea” line crystallizes the before/after with conceptual cost—time’s skin lifted and re-worn.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the quill hovers, the city leans, uncertainty is embraced. Causal chain holds: unchecked past oracle → Council fear → trellis offer → acceptance. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear within 50 words. The only drag is a 40-word reflective block that slightly dilates the tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dust has learned words, the signal will travel beyond bells, and Mara’s open broadcast carries undeniable social cost under searchlight threat. Accumulative lens holds: each night’s lyric layer thickens pattern until the final unshawled tap names the ridge, reweighting stakes. Orientation is taught early via fog, ember alcove, and radio glow; no anchors drift. One minor loop—“the room breathed / the room kept a thistled calm”—does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added strip of drawing, each creak of the rocker, thickens the mood until the burn becomes the inevitable compression. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise—the ash inside the cracks reweights the mask forever, and the gallery’s rule is paid in full on the page. Causal glue is present but subordinate; the piece earns its resonance through density, not plot reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each dive adds sedimentary density until the cog’s reassembly crystallizes new navigable night. Closure is Charged Poise—the city’s silence after the harbour test reweights every prior argument; time itself presses a finger to the city’s lips, undeniable social cost. Causal trace is present but secondary; tightening arrives via density, not reversal. One artifact: “I chose the third way, which is the first way” risks aphorism, but cadence pays off as mantra for the children’s final lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chord that "braided without knotting" is a Resonant Reconfiguration—harmony achieved yet the street still curses, so the victory is fragile, felt, and conceptually priced. Causality threads from rosette → subtractive method → confessed fears → shared breath; no off-stage shortcuts. However, the Orientation Test nicks −0.3: “velvet library” and autumn arrive late; by 120 words we’re already inside metaphor before spatial anchor, and the delay doesn’t pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s re-ignition reweights wonder vs routine; the keeper’s treasury of stories becomes the new toll, felt cost on page. Causal chain holds: failed drones → silent harp → riddle → brass hum → recovery. One micro-turn at the seam panel suffices. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the house and narrator “agree to keep each other company,” a conceptual repricing that makes the aliveness reciprocal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—every displaced object tightens the pattern until the final hush settles. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (bay, blue house, night, first-person), so no penalty applies. Cost is visible in the narrator’s bow to the shard of hush and the vow to “ask the rest,” foreclosing the fantasy of full restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ampoule’s release visibly reweights the city’s rule-set (“statues softened… plants remembered how to sway”). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the pattern is taught early and the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is delayed but functional—underwater statues, quaked plaza, and telepathic speaker are all legible by ~100 words—so the waiver applies. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bishop releases the ampoule, foreclosing the path of perpetual certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the staircase accepts his proof, motion continues, cost is the indefinite deferral of exit—an Earned Stasis that forecloses rest. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and the final image (“proof in my chest, texture under my tongue”) reweights prior material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Anya presses the keep-glyph into her skin, crystallizing the wager that tomorrow’s strangers will return. The moonlit path, the breathing greenhouse, and the ledger’s coin-for-thyme entries all re-weight the premise with felt cost. Causality is accumulative: each painted word seeds a reciprocal gift, tightening the obligation to continue. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught by line 4 and paid off in the final inkless pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the steady accretion of damp, echo, wax, crumbs, and song tightens stakes until the trunk’s discovery reconfigures “museum” into “stage.” Orientation is anchored by ~110 words; the final image—labels blooming under green light—delivers Charged Poise with felt cost: the roar will keep erasing them. No meaningful escalation mid-text, but the single deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lattice holds: yoyo → reverse gear → lens swallows its own beam → sister steps out of storm-time, each linkage legible and irreversible. Closure is Earned Stasis: he binds the yoyo-pendulum vow, forfeiting outward rescue to keep ships safely unwitnessed; cost is the nightly feeding of regret-years to the stone. Orientation taught early by the “slow exhale of low tide” and rocky island anchoring; no set-piece teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the photo strip re-weights the curse, proving the self-exposure has value. The lens is consistently Accumulative/Textural—images and smells layer until the pink flash reframes the stakes. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (mirrors, whispers) and that pattern pays off in the final multiplied-smile image; hence no penalty. The only hairline slip: “the paramedic’s hands echoed in my ribs” momentarily fractures the single-scene window, a micro-ellipsis that is unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each strike layers echo-density until the swell is “folded.” The closure is a resonant reconfiguration—orchard becomes “corridor,” wave re-shaped—so a conceptual cost is legible (the prophet expends sonic capital), satisfying Q2’s cost test. Causality is poetic, not mechanical: no clear failure risk if timing slips, so tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Orientation anchors early; driftwood ring geography stays coherent; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the expedition’s fate is redefined—braided into safer currents—so the protagonist’s crossing buys communal knowledge at personal loss. Causal chain holds: gate rusts → whistle request → turtle consent → watcher answer → return with new cartography. Orientation anchors within 120 words via “gate rusts shut,” “lowest bridge,” “elder turtle.” One transition (city → turtle back) is legible; pattern of “pattern languages” taught early and paid off in final step. Cost is on-page: “fingertips come away thinking of distances no rope can measure.”

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timetable is reclaimed, the town’s mythic fire is replaced by the detour report, and the cost is the west-stair fear returning—visible in Tomas’s facing of the shaft. Causal chain holds: letter vine → brick seam → ledger haul → public reading, each because/therefore step tightening options. Orientation is secured by line 5 (who, where, when); the “green hush” teaches the ivy motif early. No meaningful cost is felt by Mara herself—she exits intact—so the reconfiguration is conceptual, not personal, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each embedded note thickens the pavilion’s palimpsest, tightening the stake of memory vs erosion. Orientation is swift—skiff, rising bridge, tidal clock—so the -0.3 Orientation Test is waived. Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s “foundations acknowledge” the narrator, a conceptual repricing that makes his lifelong labor legible as cost. The lack of external opposition keeps escalation muted, but the pattern of sealing memories in mortar creates a visible before/after in the archive itself.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → quiet → detectable print defect → ledger reordering → proof. Orientation is swift and atmospheric; only the harbor-judge link is told-not-shown, a minor causality wrinkle. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-ordering of ledgers and the arrow reweight the library’s future meaning; the cost is the indexer’s acceptance that truth will stay submerged until someone else follows the arrow.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished gem and folded crane thickens the emotional density until the basilica release reconfigures weight/buoyancy. Closure—the shadow nesting back—pays conceptual cost (grief not erased, re-balanced) and is cued from the first line. Orientation is taught by image, waived; no causal break. Pattern holds cleanly to the humming panes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonists lock the data, signing away funding—felt cost spelled in “the institution will hate us by morning.” Causal linkage holds throughout: because they released the noise seed, they locate the valley; because they refuse extraction, they accept professional exile. Orientation is taught lyrically early (“floating observatory creaks…”) and pays off in the final drift; no ambiguity under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint—the geode’s unmined thunder—shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the matrix chip can only cast absence, so “belonging” is redefined as the margin, not the letter. The pilgrim’s slow orbit inside the telescope circle is the visible cost; the drones’ final blink confirms acceptance. Causal linkage holds—each beat because/therefore narrows the translation task to silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; dome-cord pull and star-trail exposure obey observatory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the terrace scale becomes readable only after the driftwood reveals the three-leaf boat and the narrator’s own sold past. The watch-hand groove click and the split crescent provide decisive, legible before/after images with conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds—because he once sold Mara’s line, therefore he must stand waiting without selling silence now—though the opening orientation (“at dusk”) is slightly late at ~130 words, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last handshake lifts mist just enough to reweight the neutral ground rule-set; cost is the perpetual stewardship he accepts. Causal chain holds—moon-sync, apology sequence, Daro’s refusal—each because/therefore tightens until the final image forecloses easy forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: wrong bearing → barge accident → quitting → sister summons → night paddle → confession. Closure lands with visible cost—compass shut, kayak left tied, poles now walked, not paddled—foreclosing the old evasive pattern. One soft spot: the accident itself is recounted in summary, not dramatized, slightly blunting the causal punch.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fountain spray reweights civic indifference with undeniable social cost when strangers twitch toward empathy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple-pattern reconfigures meaning rather than causal plot. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (negative-space coordinates, labyrinth tunnels) that pays off in the final cartographic ripple; no penalty applied. The vial’s “nervous bird” pulse is the visible price image; lens and cost cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each spice, beast, and dream accretes into a ritual that reweights the stake—becoming what hears the dead. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the two birds kiss beside the stone, scattering petals whose brightness is the felt cost of never again walking wholly human. Causality is poetic but intact—every inhalation of scent advances the metamorphosis; no prop or memory teleport. Orientation is taught early (“permanent moonlight” by line 2) and repays at close when moon lowers like counsel, waiving any late-anchor penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hand-prints, cloth-warm minutes, and saucer-chimes accretes until the fabric literally warms like bread—visible conceptual cost. The closure is a Charged Poise: narrator re-enters house carrying “hours that do not weigh but press the chest,” reweighting every prior image. Orientation is taught lyrically but groundedly by line 3 (“above clouds”), so no penalty. One soft moment: “cloudbound repentance” is named before its mechanics are shown, a hairline telegraph.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the breathing door stays open only while gentleness is practiced, a conceptual price legible in the final image. Causal chain holds—tear map → shadow work → stitch → yielded reality—each beat narrows options under pacifist constraint. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“recycled spaceship drifted among glinting scraps”) and anchors hold. No plot amnesia; the warhead’s earlier argument pays off when the narrator refuses impact and pays with patience instead.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds throughout: coincidence complicates but never resolves; the prophecy is fulfilled accidentally yet causally foreshadowed by her “practice.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the beach rethreads itself around the saved while Mara’s orchestrated coincidences vanish—conceptual cost legible in the image of footprints erased. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and paid off when the same hush presses thumbs against her ears at the seam-cave reveal. No teleporting props; every object (rope, oar, jars) is planted early and magnetized by need.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the fort’s lanterns relight while the narrator inventories locks, reconfiguring power without a shot fired. Causal chain holds—blackout → sundial code → archive seam → bronze bridge → wheel wakes → city re-lit—each because/therefore link tightening options. Cost is legible in the bronze quill sacrificed and the perpetual risk now sleeping inside the walls. Lens stays causal and coherent to the final hinge image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cliff “grips its own seams” and the bowl stays put, a conceptual repricing paid for by the repeated promise now shared. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—spiral, Fibonacci, triangle—each layer thickens meaning until the final image reweights the rule-set with undeniable cost: the herder can no longer slide away.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands with unmistakable cost: the bell rings into a silence “full of relief, the hush of ink drying on sky”—a Charged Poise that reweights both the stakes of censorship and the act of speaking. Causality is lyric-Accumulative: the timer’s clicks, the storm’s cadence, and the scarred sky photos layer until the only remaining action is to speak the poem aloud. Orientation is clean by line 10; the envelope-in-timetable mechanic is taught early and paid off when Mara confesses to planting it. No lens ambiguity; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sundial’s noon-sealed pact and shared path reconfigure options—peace is now a duet, not a delivery. Causal chain holds: card holes → coordinates → garden route; the refusal to blood the courier converts opposition into witness, foreclosing violent delivery. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“glass atrium beside a quiet brook”). No lens ambiguity; micro-turn (foil glance → pause → pact) tightens stakes under Situational pressure. Cost is legible: pride torn, secrecy surrendered, route inked onto palm.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of images (stars, rust, seeds, screws) accretes until the final sign renames the ruin “library.” The closure beat is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child enters, the gate widens, and the city must contend with a public living archive. Cost is visible—“the city will notice, will argue, will threaten”—and the new roof is still a tarp, not absolution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 90 words; moon phase and condemned status are concretely set.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor-path re-opens, Mara steps into color, and the four broken-clock ticks audibly reweight time. Causal chain (clock-hand → reel → corridor → bench) holds; minute hand as metronome is the persistent constraint. Deduction for轻微 lens drift: the tidal arbor’s physics is accumulative/lyric, yet the final beat asks to be read as causal restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images layer (shells→seed→sapling) and cadence deepens toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is taught early (“ancient ridge in bloom” by line 1) so no penalty. Causality is impressionistic—seed is planted because “the island counts us,” a myth-logic rather than a because/therefore chain—but the pattern is consistent and pays off in the final vegetal burst. The conceptual cost (next season may still “waver”) is legible in the closing “we have chosen what to keep breathing,” satisfying the RR requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: cadence shift from garden ritual to tidal release. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the blue bloom reweights prior guilt without tidy absolution, compass needle resting inward. Cost is the visible cerulean stain on tools and self. Orientation anchored early (islet, after severance); pattern taught by 25 % via lace instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the greenhouse becomes “a star made humble,” reconfiguring decay as contribution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns, wing residue, brine-drunk orchids accrue into a legible map—and the cost (lost notebooks, dead plants, deferred restoration) is visible in every taped crack. Orientation is immediate (“After the flood...”), and the single scene deepens without slack. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator refuses accusation, choosing instead luminous orientation via art, foreclosing revenge with tangible cost—the hidden kiln, dual furnaces, reclaimed pauses. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern intensification (ledger → frost → glass) reweighting stakes. Orientation anchors (“quiet canyon under stars,” “luminous glass artist”) are clear by line 2. Cost is legible in the final image: “a life can set without cracking” embodies hard-won stability after near-destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell “speaks by warming,” and the narrator’s silent answer reconfigures survival as ongoing creation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—frost staves, thermal maps, auroral nights layer toward this crystallized moment. Cost is legible: the ferry trauma haunts every beat, yet the conservatory becomes a site of fragile endurance. Orientation anchors instantly (“winterglass conservatory,” “capsize survivor”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis through occupancy that forecloses his old solitude with visible cost (“the city has mine too”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via sensory density and rhythmic cadence shifts until the underwater library reweights all prior stillness. Every beat tightens pressure toward this crystallization; the “tapping” evolves from haunting to plea to answered code. Cost is legible in the reciprocal address exchange and the lens’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell holds only flour and a folded note declaring namelessness, crystallizing their stance under sanctions with palpable cost—trust survives only through anonymity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (“stars floating in [the bell] like distant coins”) and patterned silence until the final breath reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors immediately (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”), and the mosaic of characters coheres spatially. Cost is legible in Farid tasting “salt… perhaps sweat, perhaps sea”—a visceral imprint of shared labor.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the storehouse is breath” reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost—the unused love was never lost, only unattended. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; fog, breath, light, and filament accrue into a coherent system where each image deepens the central stake. The monk’s lesson (“lungs as ocean”) pays off precisely in the tandem breathing climax, and the viaduct’s physical arches mirror the chest’s “archway,” binding structure to theme. No causality breaks; every object introduced constrains later action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden stabilizes, echoes soften, and the protagonist carries “a felt pattern, an inward weave” instead of a clock—reconfiguring his relationship to time with conceptual cost (loss of photographic memory). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: density increases via layered crossings, cadence shifts at the willow chamber, and the final image reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in the disintegrating photos and the shard’s dissolution—no causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: freedom redefined not as absence of chains but “the choice of what we bind ourselves to.” The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring tactile motifs (tickets, keys, seeds) until the final image reweights the entire premise. Cost is legible in the hinge’s scream, the chained ankle, and the Collectors’ hesitation; every constraint (chain, time, vault mechanics) shapes tactics. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (surreal fletching, silent piano) pays off in closure.
